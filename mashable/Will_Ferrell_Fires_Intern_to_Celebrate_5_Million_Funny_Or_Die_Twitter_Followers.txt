Will Ferrell Fires Intern to Celebrate 5 Million Funny Or Die Twitter Followers

Will Ferrell apparently would be just as happy to have Funny Or Die get 5,000 Twitter followers, so he's understandably blown away that the number is actually 5 million.
Ferrell, who founded FOD with writing partner Adam McKay in late 2006, also offers his trademark random digressions (Singapore, Destiny's Child, Mega Man's archrival Dr. Wily), outrageously false claims (he introduces himself as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks) and professions of ignorance about Twitter (he thinks you physically mail out tweets.) However, one factoid in the video is true: Ferrell doesn't have an official Twitter account. However, there are lots of fake ones.
