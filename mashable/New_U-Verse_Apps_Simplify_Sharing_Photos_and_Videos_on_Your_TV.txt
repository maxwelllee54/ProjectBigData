New U-Verse Apps Simplify Sharing Photos and Videos on Your TV
LAS VEGAS â€” Sharing photos and videos on your TV just got a little easier for AT&T U-Verse customers. The carrier announced two new U-Verse-enabled apps Monday, Twonky Beam and Pix & Flix, which allow U-verse customers to share photos and videos from their smartphones on their U-verse connected televisions.
For video, U-verse customers can now use Twonky Beam. Recently made available for Roku and Xbox 360 as well, the app lets you share a compatible video from your smartphone on your television with the simple swiping gesture.
Photos can be shared on the big screen using Pix & Flix. The app allows you to "throw" photos from your smartphone to your television for quick viewing, and once connected to your Facebook account, you can view photos from the social network on the big screen as well.
"TV is becoming a more interactive experience than ever, and that's reflected in the latest apps to hit our U-verse enabled platform," said Jeff Weber, President of Content and Advertising Sales, AT&T Home Solutions. "We're excited to work with more developers to deliver more second-screen apps to customers."
AT&T also announced a new video on demand subscription package for U-verse customers. Called the U-verse  TV Screen Pack, the $5 a month service will give customers unlimited, instant playback of an extensive library of movies on U-verse TV, Uverse.com and on the U-verse app for tablets and smartphones.
Monday's announcements were made as part of AT&T's Developer Summit, an event being held by the carrier in Las Vegas alongside CES.
