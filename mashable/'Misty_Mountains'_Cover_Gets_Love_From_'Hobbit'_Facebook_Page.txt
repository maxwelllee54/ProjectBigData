'Misty Mountains' Cover Gets Love From 'Hobbit' Facebook Page

The Hobbit's Facebook page this week gave two big thumbs-up to a capella singer Peter Hollens and violinist Jun Sung Ahn for their cover of "Misty Mountains," the theme song from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. 
The page, which has 1.3 million Likes, posted the duo's YouTube video and named them "Hobbit Fans of the Week."
"It's every YouTuber's dream to have something like that happen," Hollens tells Mashable. "Allowing my art to be shown to people who don't know about me is the best gift anyone could give me."
His solo a capella version of "Misty Mountains" has also gained traction on Reddit's front page, and YouTube's Twitter account shared the video to its nearly 22 million followers.

This isn't Hollens' first crack at covering a song with help from a violinist. In September, he teamed up with Lindsey Stirling to tackle Game of Thrones title song. 
Hollens and Stirling previously joined forces to cover of Skyrim's theme song.
