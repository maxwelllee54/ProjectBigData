Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric and Baker Hughes Investor Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this, conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today’s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matt Cribbins
Good morning from Baker Hughes’ headquarters in Houston, Texas. Today, we are excited to announce Baker Hughes, a GE Company. Presenting on today’s call are Baker Hughes’ Chairman and CEO, Martin Craighead; GE Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; GE Oil and Gas CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and GE CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Also joining today’s event are Baker Hughes, CFO, Kimberly Ross and Head of IR Alondra Oteyza; and GE Oil and Gas CFO, Brian Worrell.
Earlier today, we posted the press release and presentation on both companies investor Web sites. As a reminder, elements in presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world, and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Martin.
Martin Craighead
Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. First, I want to start-off by saying how exciting today is, for the respective stakeholders of both companies. I’m talking about our investors, but also about our customers, and employees. This is a landmark day for our companies and our industry. Second, I want to thank Jeff Immelt, Lorenzo Simonelli, and Jeff Bornstein for being here today. And for the important roles they each play in making this merger happen. This has been a truly collaborative process from the first conversations and our mutual enthusiasm only grew as we saw the potential to create a stronger company that is uniquely positioned for long-term growth.
Today, I’d like to quickly cover two key areas. Number one, I will touch on why this transaction make so much sense; and why these two great companies together will form a compelling combination that will benefit our customers in a global oil and gas equipment and services sector. We will do that by creating a new company that can deliver enhanced technology products, solutions, and services across the entire spectrum of the oil and gas industry. And number two, I’d like to talk about why this deal will create so much value for our shareholders at Legacy Baker Hughes.
First and foremost, it will allow our current shareholders to benefit from ownership in a company that has a much broader, more diverse customer proposition and expanded global reach. On the first point, let me touch on why the new Baker Hughes will be positioned for success. Together, Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas will create an end-to-end provider of technology, equipment and services across the full spectrum of the oil and gas value chain, upstream, midstream and downstream, that is a truly unique combination.
In integrating Baker Hughes’ leading products and services with GE Oil & Gas’ suite of products and manufacturing capabilities, the new company will be able to take more new innovative products, solutions and services to market faster, more efficiently and more cost effectively. Fuelled by the technology breakthroughs of the GE Store, the combined company will be backed by industry leading innovation that will be applied across all of its business segments, delivering step changes and economic performance and efficiency for our customers. Importantly, the resulting company will be far more resilient and cycle resistant.
As an example, the efficiencies gained from integrating our R&D and manufacturing capabilities will allow the Company to sustain and continue robust investment in innovation throughout every phase of the industry cycle. To that end, I see this transaction as an acceleration of the existing strategy of legacy Baker Hughes, which is based on leveraging its strength and product innovation to radically improve the economics of oil and gas production for our customers.
On that point, you might find it interesting to note that some of our earliest conversations centered on a technology venture in the realm of digitization and Big Data. With the ability to pair the reservoir knowledge and intelligent products of legacy Baker Hughes with GE’s industry leading digital platform, we see an opportunity to unleash the power of digitization and data that has long been anticipated in the oil and gas sector. This is a great example of uniting leading physical and digital technology to create something far greater for our customers.
I’m very pleased with the benefits and value that this transaction will create for our current shareholders of Baker Hughes. It provides the opportunity for ongoing ownership and accompany that, as I mentioned, is stronger more competitive and posses greater growth prospects.
Baker Hughes’ shareholders will receive substantial value through the $17.50 per share cash dividend that represented more than 30% of the Company’s underserved share price. In addition, by 2020, the Company expects to achieve $1.2 billion in cost synergies from operational and organizational efficiencies and $400 million in revenue synergies through growth opportunities. Revenue growth will be driven by the ability to approach the customer base with a far more comprehensive suite of products and services and integrated solutions through increased touch-points. The commercial diversity of the new Baker Hughes will allow us to be more resilient in periods of volatility and more successful in times of growth.
As a result, both companies’ employees will benefit significantly from being part of a larger, more diversified company. So to summer up, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the future as a result of combining two companies with respect to global brands, outstanding teams of people, similar cultures of innovation, industry leading capabilities, and strong financial performance.
So with that, I am going to hand it off to Jeff.
Jeff Bornstein
Thanks Martin. This is an exciting day for GE. First, let me sketch-out the deal with a high level. We will merge GE Oil & Gas with Baker Hughes. GE will contribute $7.4 billion of cash to fund a dividend to Baker Hughes’ shareholders, and will then own 62.5% of the combined entity. The deal will add $0.04 per share to GE in 2018 and $0.08 by 2020. This new Company will be a very strong industry competitor who, have scale, diversification, and a great team. We can weather the cycle in the short-term and we’ll be very well positioned to lead the industry going forward.
The new Company is exceptionally well positioned to serve our customers. Both Baker Hughes and GE are technical leaders. Together, we can generate even more productivity for our customers. The investments we are making in digital, it has always been our belief that the oil and gas industry would be an early adopter of analytics. The combination of the Baker Hughes oilfield services platform with Predix will deliver superior outcomes. And we’re well positioned globally to execute for our customers.
The synergies are very straight-forward, and mainly on the cost side. We see our way to $1.6 billion by 2020. And the total net present value of synergies is substantial at close to $14 billion. The transaction is in line with our commitments to GE investors on capital allocation. At the same time, we are building an even stronger business for the future. The oil and gas business fits the GE Store and leverages our capability. We leverage technology from aviation and healthcare. We share service capability with power. Predix is a common platform, and oil and gas is a key part of our global growth organization, along with healthcare, aviation, power transportation, and the other GE businesses.
Our investments in the oil and gas industry were always based on our belief that customers would seek more highly engineered solutions and we do so on a global basis. That favours this Company. Therefore, this is an appropriate time in the cycle to improve our business. This is a high level overview of the transaction. We’re creating a new Company where GE own 62.5% and the public owns 37.5% through a tax sufficient partnership structure. Baker Hughes' investors receive $17.50 per share cash dividend, and a take in a stronger company. GE investor receives 62.5% ownership, and the commensurate earnings and cash flow in this leadership franchise.
Company management and Board will be aligned with investors. There will be a world-class leadership in place, led by Lorenzo, and this new company will be managed by leaders from both companies. The synergies will accrete to GE and Baker Hughes’ shareholders and these benefits primarily reflect cost take-out, but we also believe that the new Company has substantial opportunity to enhance growth. The two companies have excellent relationships with international oil companies and national oil companies, a substantial global footprint and presence with large and small customers. We see this as a win for both GE and Baker Hughes’ shareholders with the ability to create long-term value.
We’re using the common industry assumptions for demand and decline rates. We see short-term growth in the North American unconventional markets in LNG. And over the long-term, we know the larger production fields will be developed offshore. The transaction assumes a slow recovery, really $45 to $60 per barrel through 2019, and this seems reasonable. Every business in GE has gone through cycles. We’ve developed a keen eye for what changes through each cycle and position for growth when others pull-back. This has helped us gain share in aviation, power, and healthcare over-time.
In the case of oil and gas, we tremendous opportunity for customer productivity, through innovative technology, digital solutions and financial efficiency, and here we can lead. This is the right time in the cycle to invest.
This is an exciting new company and oil and gas leader we’re creating a scale based player, a leader in oil and gas productivity. Baker Hughes brings the most advanced service technology capability, and GE brings leadership in oil and gas equipment technology with a digital framework. Their substantial synergies and the Company capitalizes on the GE Store and technology with Predix globalization, services financing, we will lead the digital transformation of oil and gas. This is a business that can deliver for investors and for customers.
Before I turn the conversation over to Lorenzo, let me drill-down on what we call the GE Store, which may not be a common term for Baker Hughes investors. This captures our enterprise strength. Every business contributes and every business benefits. And for Baker Hughes, a GE company, the GE Store really delivers. It can deliver a broader and deeper technical foundation through leveraging GE Oil & Gas research facilities, deeper material science, connection to other industries and low cost solutions.
We will have significant global scale. We have master capability in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Africa, really all the resource-rich regions. And the oil and gas team can plug into a company to country framework. There is big investment in the digitalization of the industry through Predix, our industrial Internet operating system, and Baker Hughes will accelerate our growth in asset performance management providing industry solutions.
We’re investing in advanced service tools and ways to make workers in the field even more productive. And GE Capital allows for more creative financing solutions as we work with our customers. Together, the GE Store represents incremental value for GE and Baker Hughes investors.
So Lorenzo now let me turn it over to you to present Baker Hughes, a GE Company.
Lorenzo Simonelli
Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I’m Lorezon Simonelli, President and CEO of GE Oil & Gas. I’d like to reiterate Martin’s earlier comments on how excited we all are to be here today. The combination of Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas is a great opportunity for our investors, our employees, and our customers. The new Baker Hughes will be a truly full streamed company from resource extraction, to transportation to end-use. Combining Baker Hughes’ deep industry expertise and history of technology development in oilfield services with GE Oil & Gas manufacturing and aftermarket service excellence, strengthened by the unique capabilities of the GE Store.
We estimate that in 2020, the new company will have revenues of $34 billion, while generating approximately $8 billion of EBITDA. This performance will be driven by our core businesses and substantial cost and growth synergies. Together, we can bring customers a broader set of capabilities. And we believe there are significant opportunities to optimize our cost structure. We see a clear path to $1.6 billion of run-rate synergies.
Over the next two pages, I’ll walk you through why we believe we will be a stronger company together, and why this is a truly unique opportunity for investors. We are bringing together two world-class franchises. GE Oil & Gas today operates in over 120 countries with 35,000 employees and generated $16.5 billion of revenue in 2015. Our origins are in turbo machinery, developing complex solutions for LNG, pipeline, and downstream applications. Over the last decade, GE Oil & Gas has expanded into attractive upstream adjacencies where the GE Store can help to deliver better solutions for our customers. We are a market leader in sub-sea and drilling equipment for deepwater applications.
More recently we added oilfield production equipment and services, such as artificial lift, pressure control, and down-hole evaluation equipment. We also have our digital solutions offering that provides monitoring, inspection and measurement solutions to our customers. Baker Hughes is a leading oilfield service company, generating $15.7 billion of revenue in 2015, with a century-long track-record of delivering solutions from advanced drilling to production optimization. Baker Hughes provide equipment and services to help oil and gas operators make the most of their reservoirs.
We see Baker Hughes has a great set of businesses that are very complimentary to GE’s. Together, we truly are a full-stream company, better placed to serve our customers, and a broader oil and gas segment. By bringing together GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes, the new company will be positioned to offer innovative integrated solutions across the entire value-chain, creating additional customer benefits by integrating people, equipment, and a digital from upstream, midstream to downstream.
With a full scope of critical products and services from extraction to power generation, the new entity is uniquely positioned to deliver tailored solutions to customers, governments, and local partners. The oil and gas industry spend close to $800 billion in 2015, and we believe that our new company will serve roughly 20% of this market. Through the GE Store, each business can share and access the same technology, markets, structure, and intellect. These expertise and imaging sensors, electrical science, software and analytics, material science, advanced manufacturing and computational through dynamic, all powered by Predix and GE’s digital offerings, will make us better positioned to win. The new Baker Hughes will have the capabilities to move from being an oilfield equipment and service company to a provider of oil and gas productivity solutions.
Through our scale and breadth of offering, we are creating an unparalleled and differentiated industry leader. We will hold a top-three position in 16 key areas and a meaningful presence in five more. We will participate in the segments where technology and service capability distinguish the solution, and the GE Store can generate the most value. We will be able to compete effectively across the entire value-chain, being the industry’s first full-stream provider from reservoir interpretation to downstream of process and equipment. We will be present from the molecule to the megawatts.
At the heart of both GE and Baker Hughes, is technology. Both companies have a heritage and a culture of innovation in research and development. We will connect technical teams around the world with the GE's global research sensors, including the newly inaugurated Oil & Gas Technology Center in Oklahoma City, and the exciting digital capabilities of San Ramon. Together, we have minimal overlap, and instead to complement each other’s strength. We have a broad portfolio of products and services whose global scale will achieve increased operational efficiencies and better returns on investments.
While Baker Hughes brings service capabilities, advanced products, and integrated project management, GE brings a balanced portfolio access to the GE Store and manufacturing excellence. Our cultures are a perfect fit and employees will have an exciting place to work, leveraging best-in-class product and industry expertise, we will strive to be the industry's most innovative company.
Let me give you an example of how we believe GE Technology can further enhance an industry leading products in Baker Hughes’ portfolio. AutoTrak has established new industry records by drilling 13,500 feet in one-run in the Utica shale. Even with the success, both teams are confident that through GE Technology, we can add capabilities to make it even better by applying material sciences, 3D printing, data optimization, rotating equipment, and sensing and measurement controls.
We expect to deliver an even better performance to drill faster, more efficiently and with better precision. This is just one example we feel together will be able to provide the most advanced and efficient technology to the industry.
On the next page, you can see a few examples of how the portfolio of the new company integrating solutions, both in the offshore, onshore, and mid down-stream segment. While GE provides the infrastructure equipment, Baker Hughes provides subsurface services directed to drill and complete wells. Through these integrated offerings, the new Baker Hughes can offer unique solutions to customers, to help them optimize well operations, production, and ultimately, enhance oil and gas recovery.
Through a strong balance sheet and outcome based contracting, we will be able to support even more of our customer base. For example, in the top right of the page, you see a potential solution in onshore production. GE Oil & Gas production equipment for enhanced oil recovery and access to the oilfield power can be combined with Baker Hughes drilling and production equipment in chemicals, forming a complete production optimization solution.
We are here to assist our customers as they shift to OpEx driven investment decisions, given the current macro-environment and the prolong period of the depressed oil prices. Aging fields will require increased maintenance and intervention to sustain production as depletion occurs later in the well-life cycle, and as operators look to extract more hydrocarbons from existing assets as opposed to developing new fields. In the future, we see the opportunity for full field management through the optimization of both CapEx and OpEx for production outcomes.
Our customers will benefit from our expanded offering, new integrated solutions, and the introduction of new business models like the industry’s first contractual service agreement we signed earlier this year for blowout preventers with Diamond Offshore. When we looked at our respective customer base, we see customers with whom both companies have an excellent longstanding partnership, and we will be able to serve even better in the future. And complementary customers that we will now be able to serve with the new combined portfolio.
The Baker and GE teams have spent quite some time together to understand our opportunity to deliver cost synergies. We believe that left alone the cost base in 2020 would be approximately $26 billion, and that conservatively, we can achieve $1.2 billion in cost synergies. Combined, we spend over $8 billion in material, and feel strongly that we’ll be able to drive material deflation through our combined buy.
In GE Oil & Gas this year, we’ve seen more than 6% deflation. We operate in over 120 countries and 1,200 sites. There is a significant opportunity to optimize our footprint and service delivery, building upon Baker’s great reputation. Bringing the GE heritage of advanced manufacturing, condition based maintenance, and process optimization to Bakers Hughes will lower cost. Applying Baker Hughes’ strong asset management and service deliveries will be another cost out driver.
Finally, on costs, by rightsizing our support and structure globally and ensuring streamline priorities, we expect to drive 15% savings in this area. I’ll walk you through more details on revenue synergies. But basically, we’ll increase our penetration to more complete integrate the solutions, addressing a broader scope, larger, more complex project, presence in some GE markets and greater capabilities of a flexible business model for our customers.
Our expectations on synergy ramp are outlined for you and we feel confident in our plans. These teams know how to drive cost and productivity. To make this real for you, I wanted to walk-through a few examples. On the left is the little bit more detail on the areas I highlighted. For instance, we have approximately 25% close overlap with facilities. In some instances, we have found the road.
On the right, is an example from Lufkin, which we acquired in 2013. We’ve been able to reduce unit cost by 50% through product redesign, better sourcing, and optimized logistics. In a number of our Brilliant factories, we have achieved 30% reduction in lead-times. These are both good springboards for this integration.
The global industry landscape is changing as resources are discovered in new and emerging markets. These reservoirs present unique development challenges, given the sizing complexity of resources along with the lack of existing infrastructure. Customers need long-term partners to address these challenges and bring these reservoirs online as efficiently as possible. Simplifying the supply-chain and lowering the cost curve, integrated and modular solutions are needed. For example, Africa sub-Continental Onshore is a prolific but remote and land lot project. The development of the resource would require not only E&P investments but also significant development of midstream and inland refinery. Additionally, there will be difficulty in concentrating thousands of workers to contraction of facilities in remote areas.
Our combined platform has the complementary portfolio to address a greater scope for the project and provide solutions throughout the value chain, enabling a seamless integration and understanding between the project phases. This is further enhanced through the GE Store and our extensive global presence. The integrated approach will ultimately lower overall project cost for our customers. As you know, GE has made a significant investment in the development of Predix, our industrial operating platform. We’re excited about the opportunity to bring our digital capabilities to the oilfield. We have the capabilities to increase uptime, efficiency, productivity, and operational flexibility for our upstream customers, exploiting the historical dataset and the data already acquired daily from the exploration drilling, completion, and production operations at Baker Hughes.
New Baker Hughes is in a unique position at the center of the oil and gas ecosystem to offer productivity solutions. Both GE Oil &Gas and Baker Hughes already have a competitive offering in asset performance management through GE Field Vantage and Baker Hughes’ AMBIT to monitor and optimize production. From the reservoir to power generation and the refinery, we can be the digital industrial standard to drive customer outcomes.
We are ideally positioned to perform through the industry cycles. We expect revenue growth through 2020 with strong margin leverage and free cash flow generation. The way we think about this performance is bound by few key assumptions; first, a prudent micro view of slow recovery to $60 oil price through 2019, anything above this level would be upside; second, executing on cost synergies of $1.2 billion by 2020, which represents approximately 4.5% of the cost base, but realizing revenue synergies of $400 million by 2020, which is only a 1 point share increase. Our case has Baker Hughes reaching 60% of peak 2014 EBITDA by 2020.
In summary, this combination has key critical value, creating tenants for investors on both sides. A full-stream oil and gas offering delivered by two industry leading players with strong legacies of technical innovation, the ability to provide value added integrated solutions for customers, the power of the GE Store behind this great company integrating digital offerings with best-in-class physical technology, and the ability to execute on a large pool of synergies opportunities.
In closing, I’m very excited about our prospects with this combination. We are forming a new leader in the oil and gas industry. We expect we will create tremendous value for our investors.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Jeff Bornstein.
Jeff Bornstein
Thanks, Lorenzo. I’ll start on the left side of the page. GE is contributing a 100% of our oil and gas business or $7.4 billion of cash in return for 62.5% of the new company. Baker is contributing a 100% of their business and receiving 37.5% of the new company, as well as $7.4 billion of cash.
As Lorenzo discussed, we expect to generate $13.7 billion net present value of synergies, which will be shared between both GE and Baker Hughes’ shareholders. On the right side, we will borrow $7.4 billion of incremental leverage upon the transaction. We will utilize the excess debt and equity we have in GE Capital, which results in no incremental interest costs of the company through 2019. As published this morning, the rating agencies have reaffirmed GE’s credit rating.
On the next page, we’ve laid out the EPS impact to GE and its return metrics. As you can see on the top left, we assume a mid-2017 close, resulting a $0.02 of dilution in 2017, as we begin to execute on synergies to incur upfront deal and purchase accounting charges. We see the transaction being $0.04 accretive in 2018 and $0.08 by 2020, as we deliver $1.6 billion of synergies. Our underwriting case assumes Baker’s EBITDA performance recovers from 60% of 2014 peak by 2020, well inside of industry consensus. The transaction is $1 billion free cash flow accretive, beginning in 2019, have synergies realized, and is expected to achieve 19% free cash flow conversion in 2020.
We believe the transaction will deliver in excess of 15% IRR and achieve a cash-on-cash rate of return of 10% plus by year-five, to synergize 2018 multiples approximately 6.7-times. We believe the combination will be accretive to GE shareholders beginning in 2018 and is consistent with our framework of underwriting transactions to achieve returns of 15% or better. So in summary, we believe this is a value creating transaction that delivers strong returns, build a world-class oil and gas company, that is highly competitive and to the GE Store, while creating a currency for oil and gas that allows us to maximize shareholder value with the long-term.
The next page, in parallel with the Baker Hughes GE Oil & Gas merger, we will run a process to sell our GE Water business. We’ve been evaluating the fit of GE Water in the portfolio for a period of time. Our water business does have products within our chemicals platform to serve the Oil & Gas industry as does Baker. We anticipate a gain on sale and meaningful cash proceeds that will offset synergy and integration costs associated with the Baker deal, and fund up to an additional $1 billion of cross-sell within our GE core business.
Everything we’ve discussed this morning is consistent with the capital allocation framework we’ve shared with GE investors. We will continue to sustain a very attractive dividend yield, execute the buybacks we’ve committed to, and invest in future organic growth. We believe this transaction is consistent with how we discussed inorganic growth and we will deploy incremental leverage capacity. So, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeff Immelt
Thanks, Jeff. Let me first summarize as Chairman of Baker Hughes and GE Company, and this is really exciting. We’re putting in place a broad and deep technology and service-company a true global enterprise and a digital business. Both GE and Baker Hughes enjoy a legacy of customer value creation. I really like Martin and the leadership team, and the values of Baker Hughes. And for the thousands of employees from Baker Hughes and their counterparts in GE Oil & Gas, this is a great opportunity to build a special business. There is a lot we can learn from each other. Like all deals execution will determination our success, but this business is in a strong position to navigate this cycle and grow in the long-term.
Again, total synergies on the deal are substantial, and will be shared by both investor groups. For Baker Hughes investors, there really are substantial opportunities for value creation. And this is a company that goes from molecules to megawatts.
For GE investors, this continues our strategy to create the premier digital industrial company, one that delivers productivity for our customers. With GE and Baker Hughes, the combination is a high-tech leader in essential industry. It leverages our digital platform and extends the GE Store. It will improve our financial performance, growing earnings per share by $0.04 in 2018 and $0.08 in 2020 at high returns. And this is a good deal for GE investors.
We’ve aggressively improved our portfolio through moves like this, the outcome integration, and financial services repositioning. All of our businesses leverage our core-competency in the GE Store. And we’re investing in the key industries of the future through digitization and additive manufacturing. We are well positioned for the future.
Matt, now over to you for questions.
Matt Cribbins
Great, thanks Jeff. We’ll now ask the operator to open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Our first question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
Steven Winoker
Congrats on the deal at this time and the cycle too. I wanted to start with a synergy point. This is a huge number from my perspective, $1.2 billion of cost, $400 million of revenue that is cost number. First of all, is it on top of the $500 million, the $0.5 billion that Baker Hughes has been talking about and also your $1.4 billion? How are you -- this is a completely incremental number, correct?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Yes Steve, its Lorenzo here. And yes, that is an incremental number. And we see it as very -- actually pragmatic approach. When you look at the total spend by 2020, we have got over $26 billion of cost to go after. And when you look at the aspects of complementary nature, as well of the businesses, we are going to be breaking it down into a number of areas, which we walk-through. So we get to the 4.5% of cost by looking by firstly sourcing and you look at the procurement of the materials. There is a lot of commonality in what we buy. We’ve been able to take a look at that, achieve $400 million.
When you look at the manufacturing service footprint rationalization, I think we are in many of the same locations. We are right next to each other. We’ve got opportunities to consolidate and combine those operations. We will be able to get roof-tops out. And then you look at what we have been able to achieve already, from a process optimization in our manufacturing facilities within General Electric, being able to take that also to Baker Hughes. These are things that with the advanced manufacturing to digital freight, we’ve seen 30% reduction in cycle-time. We’ve been able to take out waste, and we see $200 million there.
And then the SG&A consolidation, we know how to do this. You’ve seen us do it within the outcome, integration. We’ve done it in our other acquisitions as well and mergers, and so $400 million coming there. So, when you say, substantial number, we actually look at it as being very comfortable number to achieve. We’ve got already plans in place to be able to execute it. And then on top of that, you get the incremental revenue synergies as well. So, hopefully, that gives you some color to how we get there.
Jeff Bornstein
I was just going to say, where year is awesome. So I think we know more about the art of possible, and I think we see some good opportunities based on some of the things we’ve seen in the past. So, I think the team has underwritten, that’s the right way.
Steven Winoker
Jeff, what do you expect the cost to restructuring to come to get that number in total?
Jeff Bornstein
Steve, it's going to be about $800 million or $900 million to deliver that.
Steven Winoker
And just lastly, on the -- before I handed off. The incremental, the $7.4 billion, you talked about using excess debt, and nothing incremental. So, this is not -- also does not tap into that $20 billion plus, or $20 billion to $25 billion, that sometimes talked about just as a result of incremental leverage for the company that you guys have referenced in the past that’s available out there.
Jeff Bornstein
No, it does tap into that Steve. So this would be $7.4 billion of that roughly $20 billion of incremental average, you talked about the point I was making is because we have the excess debt and excess liquidity that goes with it in GE Capital. We will do a transaction between us and GE Capital to provide that leverage. And because the company already is incurring the interest costs, if you will, of that debt inside the enterprise, from 2019, the incremental interest cost of the company from the debt will essentially be zero, was the point I was trying to make.
Operator
The next question is from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West
So we are obviously -- we think that there is a serious transformation underway in the oil and gas business. Certainly to what you guys see solutions based services, the digitalization, and we’re big believer and unlocking Big Data here. So, I understand all the technological aspects and the reasons why this make sense. And I’m curious from the customer standpoint, we, in speaking with our contacts in West Africa, and Middle East, in Latin America, there seems to be this growing desire for GE to get bigger in the services business. So, we heard this all begin, especially when Baker Halliburton were tied up in their field transaction. I’m curious, Lorenzo or Martin, how much of this was also a driver of the two you’re getting together?
Martin Craighead
This is Martin. Let me take this, and then I’ll hand it over to Lorenzo. When Lorenzo and I first started talking probably four to five months ago it’s centered around the customer need around better analytics, data management, in mining that opportunity-set. There is no secret to this industry needs to change, it’s returns, it’s deployment of capital from our customers’ perspective. And then when we started looking at that, the opportunity set just continued to grow.
I’ve been extremely impressed with their Predix operating system. And as we started to look at the application of that, as we start to migrate it into well construction, well production, and ultimately improving the recovery factor and moving that decline curve further right. There is some domain experience that we can bring to play here that, I think, is going to completely change the conversations with any player in this industry that’s ever been able to have with the customer. Lorenzo, you want to…
Lorenzo Simonelli
James thanks for the question. And as you said, customers have been urging us to continue to expand within the oil and gas sector. And this has been very much a customer focused transaction. When you look at the portfolio, it's very complimentary. And in fact we’re terming now the use of a full stream, because we can really go wing-to-wing along the value chain. And we can incorporate the aspect of the GE Store capabilities further upstream.
So we can get closer to our customers, help them develop the fields, and extract the maximum resources. And that’s what our customers have been asking us to do. And when you look at this combination, it provides them the productivity and the outcomes that they have been looking for. Bringing down the cost per barrel, driving efficiencies, and allowing them to exploit the opportunities they have.
James West
And one last follow-up from me on the Predix operating system in the GE Store; assuming we get to all the regulatory process here, we close the transaction. How quickly do the Baker Hughes products and services get put into that platform?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Just firstly on the regulatory front. We have done already some work there, and we feel confident of being able to go forward. And also on the Predix side we see that this is an aspect we’re going to start working on straight away, because it allows Baker Hughes to start utilizing the Predix industrial operating system immediately. And we can start to actually launch commercial offerings that are integrated that we could do even outside of this merger.

The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague
Just first on the structure itself in the London Headquarters. Are there some tax benefits associated with deal, particularly upfront in that first year or two?
Jeff Bornstein
Yes Jeff, this is Jeff. So the way this structured, even though GE only own 62.5% of the operating company itself in this LLC on the structure page. What it allows us to do because of the structure and how it's formed is to consolidate a 100% of Baker Hughes for tax purposes. And so that gives us the opportunity to monetize attributes inside of Baker Hughes that potentially Baker Hughes on the wrong wouldn’t be able to monetize. So, there is some value creation here that happens to be impacts because of the structure.
Jeff Sprague
Can you just size that Jeff? I mean, I’m having a hard time getting to this $0.04 in year-one without tax actually. So maybe that’s what it is.
Jeff Bornstein
Generally, I’ll give it to you. We’ve underwritten. We think we can create somewhere between $800 million and the $1 billion of value over-time through that structure intact.
Jeff Sprague
And was there any particular other significant to 62.5% and associated with that question, even though, you’re characterizing this as long-term core. Is this an asset that could be spun-out tax efficiently by GE at some point in the future?
Jeff Bornstein
So, the way that’s seen together is Baker Hughes contributed a 100% of Baker Hughes, we contributed a 100% of Lorenzo’s Oil & Gas business. And we contributed $7.4 billion. In the relative valuation of all that, we ended up with the split of 62.5%, 37.5%, okay. There is structure as you see it today does not preclude during a span or split in the future on a tax-free basis. What it does allow you to do is do that without having 80% ownership. So in a typical sea-corp structure you’d have that 80% in order to achieve tax re-split. This structure allows you to maintain that or not introduce that tax correction even though you are below 80% ownership.
Lorenzo Simonelli
But I wouldn’t think about it Jeff, necessarily in that way. I think this is a strong fit with GE, smart deal, fits the GE Store in terms of globalization, technology, Predix, and things we’ve talked about. And look, I think we over-time have always been good at understanding value creation for customers and investors. But our game-plan really is to run this business with excellence as we look at the combination coming together.
Jeff Sprague
Can I just ask one other quick one, just why water. Jeff, you alluded it briefly. But business seems like the business saw some secular promise. And maybe you could just remind us what the OP or EBITDA is in that business?
Jeff Bornstein
So a couple of points. One is, we’ve been evaluating the fit and water in our portfolio for quite a period of time. As you know, it’s an industry that’s reasonably fragmented. There is a small overlap with the chemicals business inside of Baker Hughes. I think this just helped us crystallize our thinking from a capital allocation perspective. In terms of what that fit was and whether we were going to be an investor in water long-term. And so this to us made all the sense in the world. The water EBITDA, we haven’t disclosed that publicly. But it’s $250 million, $300 million of EBITDA, so you should think about it.
Operator
The next question is from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Byron Pope
Martin, when we visited to summer, you seem fairly excited about the opportunity to be able to new and more diversity sales channels. And so as you think about the Baker Hughes portfolio from advanced drilling services to longing evaluation, to completion systems, prediction optimization. Which of those are you most excited about in terms of the opportunity to accelerate the go-to-market strategy?
Martin Craighead
I have a hard time figuring out which one I’m not excited about borrowing. Again, as we look at what the GE Store can bring to bear on the Legacy GE in terms of engineering, let’s say, cost out of the products. So big part of the synergy number here that Lorenzo referred to, and I think he gave a great example on the Lufkin pump. As we build these new sales channels, obviously, if you can provide leading technology, which we’ve continued to do and that’s only going to be accelerated. If you can do it at a price point in some of these products, then we’ll continue to actually capture more of that margin opportunity.
So, I mean, it goes -- that’ll expand completions, logging equipment, AutoTrak drilling assemblies, verta-tracks, artificial lift. It’s a magnificent opportunity to drive those local service companies in those new sales channels, even faster than, frankly then we ever imagined. Lorenzo, do you want to?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Byron, just to add, I think also the complementary nature of this transaction will result in Baker Hughes being able to take advantage of the government company contracts that are in place. Our presence that GE has and the scale in Saudi Arabia, in Brazil, in China, and other countries, if you look at being able to provide incremental growth opportunities for what are great products of Baker Hughes into new sales channels. And that’s what we’re looking to do as well. And you can see those through the revenue synergies. And we feel very confident that the GE Store, just from a commercial standpoint, is going to add a tremendous amount of capability.
Operator
The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell
May be just first question for Jeff Immelt, specifically. Obviously, the last 18 months has been a huge amount of change at GE in terms of acquisitions, divestments, spins. Obviously, there is water today, 3D printing last week, and probably this Baker Hughes news. So when we’re thinking about the next couple of years, the path to your 2018 targets. Should we assume that this pace of portfolio change significantly dives down now, particularly as you do have $7 billion out of the $20 million of leverage being deployed today? Or could we see continuous further change depending on the share price?
Jeff Immelt
Julian, you never can predict events and how things unfold. But I would say, when I think about everything we’ve talked about, the bridge to '18 and things like that, it's really a focus on execution, organic growth margin enhancement, free cash flow conversion, things like that. And that’s fundamentally the way we think about the Company, how we want to run it. So I think about it as an execution case. I think this was the unique opportunity. We wanted to grab it, because, I think from an oil and gas standpoint, it gave us an opportunity to, in many ways, I think complete the business strategically in an essential way.
And I think, look, I’ve been a part of this over the last 15 to 20 years. Our thesis was never driven around the oil and gas, trying to time when the price was $150 or $50, or whatever was it between. It was this notion that the industry was going to become more technically sophisticated as time went on that the customers were going to demand more broader solutions things like that. And that’s what we’ve been betting on a. And so I think when this opportunity came up, it just made all kinds of sense for investors of both companies and our customers to grab it. But Julian I think it's a great question. I think execution is what our investors want to see us doing. And that’s how we think about the next couple of years.
Julian Mitchell
And then one on the Baker Hughes, GE Company, specifically, I guess, it has a very broad portfolio. But there are some gaps, maybe in some areas where the market share could be built up downstream, industrial service, the GE physical equipment service. And the company will have a pretty under-levered balance sheet. So, is there much of an appetite to do acquisitions post the deal closing, or is the focus just on the self-help on cost-out?
Martin Craighead
So Julian, I think we’re in the early stages here. We’re clearly focused on the execution at-hand, driving the cost out, and also the revenue synergies. There is a tremendous amount that we can do from an organic perspective. And I think let's talk about in-organic, as we get private down the road. There is a lot that we’ve got on our hands at the moment, and feel very confident that we can already achieve a lot with what we govern in the portfolio.
Operator
The next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.
Jud Bailey
Question maybe for Martin or Lorenzo. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you see between the GE subsea and surface portfolio, and combining it potentially with some of these products from Baker Hughes? How do you think about that? And any opportunities you see for the combined companies?
Martin Craighead
This is Martin, Jud. I’ll take the first stab at that and then hand it over to Lorenzo. As I said earlier, this has all been precipitated based on looking through the lens of our customers, what are the challenge is. It's all about getting the cost per barrel down, get the recovery factor up. And we look at the ability, you talk subsea. So here we have the world' leading, drilling, and completions business, which is all below the mud-line, when you look at the separation, compression, electronic, BOP capabilities on the mud-line. And then you look at the boosting capability of Baker Hughes in terms of ESPs, and then you look at the pipeline commissioning capability.
Now, you picture a deepwater operator that now has the ability to have a conversation with the new Baker Hughes. They take that dollar per barrel way down, manage the risk, and leverage again a world-leading technology organization. I mean this has hasn’t happened before. And this is why we’re so excited about what the opportunity is. And I could go on-and-on, whether it’s the deepwater or whether it’s the unconventionals, it’s really just incredibly opportunity rich environment. Lorenzo?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Martin, I think you said it very well. And Jeff just further complement to what Martin said. If you look at each of the segments, it’d on the offshore, it’d be on the onshore, we’ve got opportunities to combine the capabilities and really provide across the value chain. And it’s bringing together the strength of what GE Oil & Gas has, from an equipment perspective, also from a power generation perspective, all the way down to the mud-line, and being able then to integrate it through data analytics. And that’s where productivity can further be enhanced in the future.
When we talk about the cost-out, we talk about the synergies, all of this is they says normal day-to-day things we’ve done before. As we go forward, also through analytics, there is tremendous incremental opportunities within the new Baker Hughes.
Martin Craighead
Jud, this is Martin again. I just want to follow-up. As we were exploring this opportunity, a term power to lift kept coming-up. As we build out the North American ESP business and we begin moving into the scoop and stack, the outer-fringes of the Bakken, the grid, the electrical infrastructure is weak. And here you have the capabilities of putting power as part of the entire listing conversation with our customers. Before, here you had the world’s leader in electrical submersible pumps. But the conversation couldn’t go, as to, how do we help the customer generate that infrastructure to run those pumps. Now our sales teams are going to be able to provide a broader solution. And there is no one that can do that except us, full-stop.
Jud Bailey
My follow-up is a couple of initiatives that each company had separately. I just want to confirm continue Baker on trying to sell the pressure pumping business, and then I believe GE had a joint venture with NOV. Is that still in place with the new combined company, or has anything changed on that front?
Martin Craighead
So I’ll take the pressure pumping. Jud, yes, the strategy is intact as we said on our earnings call last week. We’re nearing it end of process. As both these companies started talking, we evaluated our opinions and notes on that business. And we came to the same conclusion that it’s the right way forward, given the dynamics around that particular business segment. Lorenzo?
Martin Craighead
Just so maybe correct on the aspect of the NOV. What we have in place is a joint collaboration and a partnership for the equipment package that we provide to NOV for FPSO. That will continue as a commercial relationship. And again we look to strengthen our equipment packages that we’re offering externally. And FPSOs is a marketplace where we’ve been strong and we’ll be continued to be so.
Operator
The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Jeff, you guys have said many times that you don’t want to underwrite oil and gas recovery. So, can you talk a little bit more about your assumptions that you’re making in the steel or around market growth moving forward. I know you’re saying that you only assume a modest recovery in oil. But how important is market recovery to your return on this investment? It does seem like you have at least some growth recovery in your models to get to the $0.04 of EPS in ’18?
Jeff Bornstein
So our underwriting assumption -- and then we’ll let Martin kind of weigh in on the Baker view of where the market is going over the medium term here. We’ve assumed that oil has a modest recovery, beginning in '17, kind of $50, low $50, maybe mid-$50s in 2018. And then by the end of '19, it's something that’s approach $60. I think we’re well inside of what industry consensus is. And we think it's a reasonably pragmatic. Lorenzo talked about earlier the way we’ve thought about underwriting, the risk in this.
We’ve got Baker Hughes’ EBITDA getting back to 60% at 2014 peak by 2020. And industry consensus for instance on Schlumberger and Halliburton is to be 100% or over a 100% at that point in time. So, we’ve tried to take what I would describe as a reasonably pragmatic approach on how we thought about the recovery. Martin, do you want to add anything.
Martin Craighead
Yes, thanks Jeff. And I would agree, first of all, that it is a modest perspective when we agreed on that. But Andy as we had said on the Baker Hughes’ earnings call last week, I think we’ve had a pretty consistent and correct view of how this market’s been evolving. Overall, the decline curve is very real and our customers are battling that. And we’ve had a crushing reduction in investment, which is going to catch-up with the business. And you have this newest issue in North America where you have a high-grading of the portfolio and recovery factors, and production numbers have been a little more buoyant. Then all talking heads or experts have been indicating. But at the end of the day, you can't fight the decline curve, it's real, and it's common.
So as we said, we continue to see a slow grind-up in North America through probably in the next couple of quarters. And subsequent to that, offshore will -- there is no denying that they’re most prolific sales in the world, and our customers will continue to figure out ways to monetize it. But that’s also what precipitates this combination is being able to get that at cost basis down for our customers.
Jeff Bornstein
So the only -- last thing I would add. We obviously underwrote it downside case as well where you essentially -- oil does nothing for the next three or four years. And even in that case, largely driven by the synergy value that’s created there, we’re better off if a company having done the deal or not doing the deal. And we still think we create, even in the sideways market. So, we did consider the fact that there would not be any oil recovery, and we still thought it made financial sense for the company.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Lorenzo, you talked about being able to gain a percent of share, it's for $400 million of revenue synergies. But can you talk about the challenges of gaining share in a market that’s already seen a lot of consolidation. How difficult do you think you will be to get there and how important is and those in Predix to help in the market share equation?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So thanks for the question. And again, first of all, I think, it's very achievable. And when you look at the technology basket that we readily available when both of the companies, we’ve been investing over the downtime. And the NPIs are going to be introduced in the market place. That’s outside of Predix. Just to enhance capabilities of artificial lift. When you look at the different elements of, again completing wells, there is a lot that the companies have been investing in. So from a product introduction, you will see that increase.
Then as you look at revenue synergies, there is the complementary nature of the portfolio, being able to aggregate, from a package perspective, to give a better outcome. You have the example of power to lift. As you look at also the offshore completion, being able to take from the mud-line, all the way to the surface, being able to connect the value chain. Nobody else in the industry can do that. And so we’re able now to provide that portfolio. And the third element, as you say, Predix, that analytics and the opportunity to reduce some planned downtime, to increase efficiency.
We’ve already started to see that take place within the industry as you look at up-time that we’ve been able to achieve on our rotating equipment. We’re now going to take that across the value chain. So it’s really those three elements put together that provide us the confidence in the revenue synergies, and the relationships we have with customers, which had a broader level also General Electric and the GE Store, is very complimentary. So, we see this as very feasible going forward.
Jeff Bornstein
Let me also add to what Lorenzo and Martin said. Look, I’ve had a chance to be with every oil and gas CEO in the world over the last years. Baker Hughes has an awesome reputation around the industry. I think the ability to bring more scale to their reputation is upside. It makes the industry more competitive. It gives customers more options. And I think there is a tremendous amount of value that’s going to be created by the combination of these two companies.
Operator
Our final question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse.
James Wicklund
Two questions really, digital-industrial company, that’s a different definition for oilfield service than most others are used to. And your explanation of how you’re going to get there is interesting. I’m just curious, how long do you guys think it will take before you can take the digital capabilities that you have at GE, and fully incorporate them into Martin’s innovative products across the lines, and be able to offer the digital solutions company to the industry. Does that take six months, two years, how long does it take to optimize that?
Martin Craighead
Jim, good morning, this is Martin. I’m going to take this first, and then hand it off to Lorenzo. We’re already doing that. We’re already underway. As we said, we had already started talking about this possibility. This deal is a result of the initial discussions around the digital industrial and what the capabilities were. And we’ve already sat down with s customer of quite large significance and exploit that. And they’ve already actually even signed up to work with us. So this isn’t a three months, six months, one year. This is already underway.
Lorenzo Simonelli
Martin, just to add, I think, again, as we’ve gone out and we’ve spoken to some of the customers, it's already underway. I think also you mentioned aspects of new terms. And I think within the industry, today, through this partnership, through the creation of this new Baker Hughes, we are introducing new terms. We’re introducing the term of full-stream and the capability to provide across the value chain, and that digital industrial capability within oil and gas. And I think you had Jeff Immelt mention previously, this industry is changing. It’s becoming more technologically challenged, and we’re here to help our customers. And that’s what we’re receiving as feedback from our customers.
Jeff Bornstein
I would just say, I think, the oil and gas industry is maybe the first in terms of driving the industrial Internet. Terms like asset performance management, no unplanned downtime, really came from this industry. The customers know how to monetize an extra hour, an extra day better than any other customers in the world. So, I think in the end, that’s what this is all about. And again, what I would just say is the combination of, let’s say, an analytical operating platform on top of an oilfield services capability, that’s precisely the competitive advantage in the industry, so very exciting.
Martin Craighead
Great, thank you. I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. And just as a reminder, the replay of today’s webcast will be available this afternoon on both companies’ investor Web sites. Jeff, maybe to wrap-up?
Jeff Immelt
Yes, Mat. Thanks again for everybody joining us on short notice. I think a really exciting deal at the right time and the right industry, really a great fit, complimentary fit, of two industry leaders. I think, going forward, this new company can use every aspect of the GE Store. Globalization, it really increases and enhances our capability. Technology, the ability to bring more technical solutions for our customer, predictive analytics, all the things for the GE Store. I think both Martin and I put it really at the top of mind, creating shareholder value, creating customer value. And we think this deal, both today and in the future, is going to do both of those. So really a great day and we look forward to future.
