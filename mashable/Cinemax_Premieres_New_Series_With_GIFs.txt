Cinemax Premieres New Series With GIFs

The hottest moments in television normally get the GIF treatment within hours of airing. Previously, it's been fans who create the animated looping recaps, but brands are catching on to the appeal.
Cinemax's newest series, Banshee, premieres its first episode through a series of GIFs, served like chapters in a book.  
They can also be viewed on the official Tumblr site, the Banshee GIF shop, created by New York agency Campfire. The GIF series is part of a creative partnership with BuzzFeed. 
Viewers will have access to the "most intriguing and provocative moments" in the GIF shop, Cinemax said in a statement. The GIFs are categorized so that users can use them as reactions, such as "OMG," "LOL" or "WTF" â€” part of a larger trend that replaces emoticons in conversation with the animated format.

Banshee, the latest work of True Blood creator Alan Ball, features an ex-con and master thief (Antony Starr, Rush) who assumes the identity of a sheriff in Banshee, Pa. Starr's character continues criminal activities, while being hunted by gangsters he betrayed years before. 
The story has a free prequel comic, "Banshee Origins," which is available on iTunes. A website filled with more back-stories, interactive videos and other extras will launch in conjunction with the premiere. Viewers will be able to unlock more content as the season rolls out.
Banshee premieres on Cinemax Friday at 10:00 p.m. EST.
