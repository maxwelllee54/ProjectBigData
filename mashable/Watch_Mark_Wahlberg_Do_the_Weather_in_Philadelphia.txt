Watch Mark Wahlberg Do the Weather in Philadelphia
Â 
Viewers of Good Day Philadelphia got a surprise Wednesday morning when Mark Wahlberg stopped by to do the weather and traffic. 
Wahlberg, who is promoting his upcoming movie Broken City, delivered the impromptu report on Fox affiliate WTXF. Looking ahead to the seven-day forecast, Wahlberg, joined by Broken City director Allen Hughes, pronounced Wednesday's 54 degrees "perfect golf weather." Wahlberg then slipped into a Philly accent for the traffic report: "Look at this congestion here. We're expecting 40- to 45-minute delays if you're coming east bound on the 676 here. You're going to have some serious problems. Why don't you stop and get yourself a hoagie?"
Wahlberg goofs amiably but he's a long way from topping Sacha Baron Cohen's local news cameo in Borat below.
