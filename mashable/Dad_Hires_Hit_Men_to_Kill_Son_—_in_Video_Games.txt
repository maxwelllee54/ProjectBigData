Dad Hires Hit Men to Kill Son — in Video Games

A father in China perturbed by the amount of time his adult son spent playing online video games didn't ground the young man. He didn't take away his electronics. And he didn't try to reason with him. 
Instead, he took what may be a much more logical approach: Hiring digital hit men in the form of other gamers to kill off all his son's characters, according to the BBC.
The son reportedly uncovered the truth after getting tired of other players targeting him then asking one why he was being singled out. The father said he was just trying to discourage his son from playing so much, he told local media, and the two have reportedly solved their differences since. 
It's a different form of parenting, to be sure, but just the latest examples of parents who have sought to counteract technology's increasingly all-consuming spell over sons and daughters worldwide. This Christmas, a mother gained attention online after giving her 13-year-old son an iPhone for Christmas — but requiring him to sign a contract agreeing to how he would and wouldn't use the device first. In February, a father uploaded video of himself shooting his daughter's laptop several times and the clip went wildly viral online.
