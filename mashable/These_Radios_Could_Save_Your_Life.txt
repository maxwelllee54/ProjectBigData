These Radios Could Save Your Life

LAS VEGAS — Scientists warn that Hurricane Sandy-sized storms are likely to become biannual and not once-in-a-lifetime events. In other words, it's time to get serious about dangerous weather and finding ways to track and react in real time. In this case, knowledge is power and safety.
Eaton, a company that's been making weather-ready gear for a long time (I have one of its hand-cranked radios at home), unveiled this week at CES 2013 a new set of weather emergency clock radios that could help you get out of the way of the next super storm before it's right on top of you.
The new ZoneGuard and ZoneGuard Plus are battery- and AC-powered weather radios that offer Weather Band, AM and FM frequencies. Most notably, they have an LED-based light on top that tells you if the weather situation is, for instance, safe (green) or red (dangerous) for up to 25 weather locations, based on county codes. They're small enough to sit on an end table, and they perform all the functions of standard clock radios.
The $99 version comes with two tiny, wireless remote modules that you can place in other rooms — additional remotes cost extra. These modules communicate with the base radio and will also alert you to dangerous weather emergencies.  Both ZoneGuard radios will ship sometime in Q1. Would you buy one of these radios for your area or do you trust your own weather instincts? Check out the video above and then let us know in the comments.
