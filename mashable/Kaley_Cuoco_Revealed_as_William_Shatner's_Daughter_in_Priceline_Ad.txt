Kaley Cuoco Revealed as William Shatner's Daughter in Priceline Ad

The daughter of Priceline's Negotiator, a.k.a. William Shatner, is none other than Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco. Who knew?
In the ad above, Cuoco is given over, Kill Bill-style, to a martial artist master to learn the craft of negotiating. But things changed a lot over the 20 years Cuoco spent in the monastery. Now you can use Priceline on your smartphone and "you don't even have to bid." Perhaps the real surprise here is that Shatner, who was supposed to retire from Priceline ads last year and appeared to be killed off in ad, is back. Rather than coming back from the dead, though, this seems to be a flashback of sorts.
However, a press release from Priceline makes it clear that Shatner will be starring in more ads, so this isn't a changing of the guard as much as the introduction of a new character.
