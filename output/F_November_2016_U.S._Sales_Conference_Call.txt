Good morning. My name is Kelia [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Monthly Sales Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the call over to our host Erich Merkle, U.S. Sales Analyst. Please go ahead.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Kelia. Good morning everyone and welcome to Ford’s November 2016 U.S. sales call. Today, we’re joined by Mark LaNeve, Ford’s Vice President, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service; and Bryan Bezold, Ford’s Senior Economist. So first step, we are going to look and I did a bit of industry perspective for Mark. So, I’m going to turn things over to Mark.
Mark LaNeve
Great. Thank you Erich and good morning everyone out there to what will be, hard to believe but our last one of these calls for 2016. So with that let’s look at some November highlights. Based on this morning’s incoming data and looking at our own data obviously, we believe the industry performed very well in November.
Our early read is a total sales including medium and heavy trucks came in at approximately 1.41 million vehicles last month. This will correspond to a total industry SAAR of about 18.3 million vehicles, providing the overall industry with an approximate 5% increase versus a year ago.
Much of that increase last month came from a retail increase of approximately 6%. Albeit that increase did come at higher overall industry incentive spend at approximately $570 per unit higher versus the same month a year ago. We estimate a retail sales number of about 1.15 million vehicles for the month. It would appear that November sales at these levels were likely a record November for the industry.
Moving on to Ford, at Ford overall sales were up 5% with a 197,574,000 vehicles sold. Our strong retail performance drove that increase with retail sales up 10% making it our best November retail sales month in 12 years. Our fleet sales were down 9% and as we stated in the first half of the year much of our sales of daily rental fleets were front loaded in the first half of 2016. It would decline moving through the second half of 2016.
In November, our overall fleet sales in-line with this were down 9%. As I mentioned, industry incentives were up about $570, compared to last year. Ford incentives were up less than that at $460 relative to year ago levels and compare very favorably not just to the industry, but to one of our primary competitors that increased their incentive spend by well over a $1000 per unit last month.
In fact, we had very strong ATP performance with Ford’s overall average transaction pricing in November expanding by over $1000 versus a year ago. This was more than three times the rate of the industry, we saw a $320 increase in overall transaction pricing last month.
Our overall transaction prices totaled 34,900 per vehicle last month, which represents some of the strongest levels we have ever seen at Ford. One of the factors driving this Super Duty is overall average transaction prices, which were again very strong last month relative to the overall industry into the segment. We are seeing higher sales or richer mix of the all new Super Duty pick up. I’ll add a few bullet points on that in a minute.
Our outlook for the year remains unchanged at 17.8 million total vehicles. We had a strong sales in November, which places the year-to-date pace at a level consistent with the year ago, with 2015. And we are maintaining our guidance for 2017 as well at 17.7 million vehicles.
Looking at the performance of our individual products last month, let's start by focusing on pick-ups which were a terrific story for us. Ford F-Series sales totaled 72,089 trucks last month representing 11% increase for our best November F-Series sales performance since 2001, it’s our best in 15 years. We saw retail sales increases on both the F-150 and Super Duty and government and commercial were also up year-over-year for F-Series.
This year F-Series on track achieved their best sales performance in a decade with a short of hitting 800,000 pickups this year. That’s kind of a magic number for us and for reference the last time we did 800,000 in F-Series was 2005, over a decade ago. We’re obviously very pleased with F-Series performance as all-new Super Duty is becoming a larger part of overall mix, and I will have more to comment on that in a second.
The all-new Super Duty continues to be off to a great start. It is a class leading product, we’re able to really deliver what Super Duty customers demand by light weighting with the military grade alumina alloy body and reinvesting some of that rate savings and class leading capability.
In addition, customers are choosing our premium series and smart technology such as trailer guidance and adaptive steering at record levels. In fact, Lariat in higher trim level 2017 Super Duty trucks made up 71% of the nameplates retail sales last month. It totally remains brisk with the truck sitting on dealer watch just 22 days. Wherever I go across the county or do the customers show very high price for the capability and technology being incorporated into the all new Super Duty, so we continue to be extremely pleased with the launch of this Lincoln product.
Let’s take a look at Ford SUVs. Ford SUV sales totaled 60,079 vehicles last month, representing a 20% increase versus the year ago. The increases were across the entire portfolio with Escape up of 11%, Explorer up 14%, Edge up 32%, and Expedition up 75%. The increase was entirely retail driven, although we did have another strong month with the Explorer Police vehicle as we've had all year. Ford SUV sales are running really close right now to the record levels that was achieved in 2001.
Finally, let us turn to Lincoln, which had another very strong month. Lincoln retail sales were up 19% in November again outperforming the premium segment, which we estimate was likely flat or may be even down slightly last month. We were also seeing much improved transaction pricing at Lincoln with average transaction prices up $1,600 for the Lincoln brand compared to a year ago. This compares very favorably to the premium segment, which was up about $300 per unit.
Our new products at Lincoln are working to deliver strong sales and much improved transaction pricing. And MKX was up 30%, while MKZ was up 9% last month, and the all-new continental added 1,419 vehicles to the brand's overall sales in November, representing the vehicles best performance since launch. With improved availability, we saw continental turning on dealer launch in just 13 days last month.
And customers are purchasing originally appointed Continental are too-high trim packages reserve in black label made up half of Continentals sales, which is a great sign. So, that’s a look at November, strong month for Ford in the industry.
And with that I’d like to turn it over to Bryan for an update on the economic front.
Bryan Bezold
Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Incoming data showed the U.S. economy remains characterized by a relatively healthy household sector along with signs of the corporate sector has begun to adjust to the strong dollar and low oil prices. The second estimate of third quarter GDP data showed that the economy grew by 3.2%, the fastest since 2014, as growth in household spending was complemented by improving growth in private investment and exports.
Third quarter consumer spending grew by 2.8%, investments by 2.1%, and exports by 10.1%. Imports grew by 2.1% and government consumption and investment grew by 0.2%. Third-quarter corporate profits rose by 6.6% after falling by 0.6% in 2Q. Other economic data showed a trend of relatively healthy household sector, an improvement in the corporate sector extending into the fourth quarter.
Aside from U.S. auto industry sales PMI unemployment insurance claims and consumer sentiment, these data reflect conditions prior to the election and do not reflect consumers or businesses assessment of any new policies from the new administration. Specifically, through October the labor market continued to provide support for households as [indiscernible] rose by 161,000.
The unemployment rate saw one-tenth of a percentage point from September to 4.9%. Average hourly wages rose 2.8% from prior year in September and are up 2.6% year-to-date. New claims for unemployment insurance showed that labor market strength extended into November.
During the weekend, the November 26 there were 268,000 new claims for unemployment insurance with the forward moving average at 251.5000 [ph]. The last time new claims were consistently below that level was in 1973. October inflation adjusted disposable personal income rose 0.4% from September and inflation adjusted consumer spending rose 0.1%. The November reading of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose 4.4 points to a five-month high of 91.6%, responding to your current economic conditions, as well as conditions over the next year and next five years, improved from October.
The share of survey respondents reported that it was a good time to buy a car, rose 3 percentage points to 67% rather and the share reporting that it was a bad time to buy a car fell by 4 percentage points to 25%. The housing sector appeared buoyant in October, as new housing starts rose by a surprisingly 25.5% from September with both single and multi-family construction improving.
Permits rose by 2.9% from prior month on improvement in both the single and multi-family components. Existing home sales rose by 2.0% from September, while new home sales were the long lead spot following 1.9%. October industrial production was unchanged from September manufacturing production rose 0.2%, but was offset by a 2.6% decline in gas and electric utility output.
The November manufacturing PMI rose 1.3 points to 53.2 on improved production and new orders. As Eric mentioned earlier we see the November SAAR approaching the 18.3 million unit range putting the year-to-date industry SAAR at about 17.8 million units.
With that summary, let me turn it back to Eric.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Brian. Taking a look at a few housekeeping items, I will take care of those here a second. Taking a look, we will start off here with our fleet as a percentage of total sales. In the month of November 2016, our fleet as a percentage of total sales was 22%. The break out on that was 11% commercial, 6% government, and 5% daily rental. Comparing this to November of 2015, our fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 25%. The breakout on that is 12% for commercial, 6% for government, and 7% for daily rental
Taking a look at calendar year-to-date, so if you look at November calendar year-to-date 2016 fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 30%. The breakout on that is 13% for commercial, 6% for government, and 11% for daily rental. Taking and comparing that to calendar year-to-date number 2015, fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 28%. The breakout on that is 12% for commercial, 5% for government, and 11% for daily rental.
Taking a look at stock levels inventory, our growth stock for the month of November 2016 was 654,000 vehicles, which translates into 83 days' supply. The break out for that is 155,000 cars, 306,000 trucks, and 193,000 SUVs. Comparing this to October of 2016, the month previous, our total growth stock was 650,000, which translated to 90 days' supply. The breakout was cars were at 145,000, trucks were at 315,000, and SUVs were at 190,000.
Comparing our growth stock to November of 2015, a year ago, our total growth stock was 665,000 vehicles, which translated into 85 days' supply. The breakout on that was 184,000 for cars, 310,000 for trucks, and 171,000 for SUVs. So with the housekeeping items out of the way, Kelia we're going to turn things over and take some questions. And we will take things off with the analyst community first if we are through please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.
John Murphy
Good morning guys. Just had a couple of question here. First on the F-150 and the Super Duty, in general I was just curious what you are seeing on pick-up truck pricing in aggregate and it sounded like some of the competitive actions you were highlighting on incentives were targeted at this segment and also where you are in the Super Duty build in inventory in India a because it seems like there is still some way to go and it’s got some pretty good strength already.
Mark LaNeve
Yeah, thank you John. Obviously there was heightened level of incentives across the industry as I mentioned. Ford was actually less than what the average industry increase was. Some of that we’re seeing pick-ups, not an alarming number was up basically in general, almost in every segment incentive spending on a year-on-year basis. So, we didn’t see anything in particular on incentives on pick-up trucks that is worth mentioning. Our ATP performance, price performance was strong.
As I mentioned especially with the new Super Duty and I would characterize it as we’ve had a great launch in terms of giving the right mix out to the dealers. We’re still continuing to build inventory in the ramp-up, you know filling our commercial and government orders and so on a very rich mix, the biggest problem we have right now, we are selling an incredibly strong rich mix in terms of Lariat up a level addition, so fulfilling those orders as dealers replenished their inventory is actually a good problem to have and that’s what we are working on right now.
John Murphy
Okay. And then just a last question just on the linking continental, I mean the launch there is something that’s going very well, any early read as to the channels if that’s being sold into or really who the buyers are at this point?
Mark LaNeve
I don’t have that information in front on me John. Anecdotally, the Lincoln dealers, we just have the Lincoln dealer council in with about 15 of our top Lincoln dealers from around the country. They will tell you that they are seeing really a all new buyer to the Lincoln brand being brought in by Continental and incidentally are buying other Lincoln’s or Ford’s pretends to be a good dealership in the process. So, we are delighted with historic Continental ads, it has had and what is new for the brand and we are seeing, it is mainly anecdotal at this point, but they tend to true-out over time as you hear they can’t see that from the dealers, we are seeing a different kind of buyer into the Lincoln dealership with Continental.
John Murphy
Great, thank you very much.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.
Dan Levy
Hi, yes this is Dan Levy on for Brian. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to just ask there was an Edmonds article from a couple of weeks ago in which they mentioned about a third of the trade-ins that we’ve seen for new car sales this year, they’ve had negative equity. I’m wondering if you are seeing a similar trend, can you give us a sense first of all for us, what percent of your new car sales involves trade-ins and are you hearing more plus from your dealers for greater trade allowances that they can accommodate consumers with negative equity.
Bryan Bezold
Well Dan a good question. It kind of goes hand in hand with what’s been publicized in terms of overall residual pressure, you know pressure on residual values in the industry. That will go hand in hand with equity, obviously the less that a trade is worth with the customer more risk from an equity position. We’ve seen it, I don’t have it, a third in the industry. The latest number I saw is actually below 30%, but it would have been climbing over the last several years. This is, in terms of customers in a not equity position, it’s actually been climbing for several years, couple percentage points a year. With our strong residual values our lower lease penetration in the industry, we run at a more favorable position to that, but it is obviously something the overall residual values that’s some that we are keeping our eye on, we’ve talked about and that one of the reasons that our guidance was not having the industry going up next year is that’s in-line with a lot of positive factors in the industry that’s one of the drags in the industry that we keep an eye on.
Dan Levy
Got it. And do you have a sense of roughly what percent of your new car sales are trade-ins of some sort?
Mark LaNeve
Trade-ins are over half and 80% of the buyers do need a loan obviously to purchase a new vehicle or partnership obviously with full credit becomes a key asset for us.
Dan Levy
Got it. And then a question more broadly on the industry and the economy, I realize it is still early days post-elections, but feel like I’m wondering if you have an updated view of the industry post-election, I know at your Investor Day couple months ago you cited, I think your total SAAR for 2017 or 17.7 [ph] and so probably some slight decline versus 2016, but with all the discussion of potential tax cuts and potential for greater productivity in the economy, do you think there is upside for your estimate or is any of that upside washed away by risk of higher rates may be will shrink from automakers around what we've seen is higher incentive spend?
Mark LaNeve
Well another good question, we do have the union yang [indiscernible] of, you know you got positive factors, the customer is still in good shape, the consumer confidence is strong interest rates, although a risk of increasing restored relatively very low levels the Car Park is still average age of the vehicle is well over 11.5 years, you know these are all positive gas prices still relatively really low that’s all positive for the industry, but it could be looking at gradual rate increases. We just talked about residual values. So we are always looking at all those factors and trying to balance them up and it turned specifically of the presidential election, but we haven't changed our financial guidance or our industrial volume guidance as a result specifically to the election Dan.
Dan Levy
Okay, thank you.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.
Rod Lache
Good morning everybody. Just, I wanted to ask you on the interest rate question first, how you think the industry adjusts to that, whether that’s something that would affect demand mix or do you think industry subvention levels adjust for those rate changes and then I wanted to sneak in a question on 2017 if I can?
Mark LaNeve
Okay Rod, thanks. We've long anticipated a gradual increase in interest rates over time and we've had that accounted for in our Ford business planning. We expect that any increases will be moderate and only made if there is evidence if the consumer buying power employment and other factors support that increase. The industry has done a pretty good job of keeping payments relatively stable as terms have expanded gradually over time and we have some fluctuation upwards obviously in industry-wide lease penetration, but that’s our outlook towards it is that it would be gradual and that it will only be done if the consumer be in a position to accept it.
Rod Lache
Right, but you are suggesting on the industry adjust may be through subvention to keep monthly payments relatively stable that’s what I'm hearing?
Mark LaNeve
You know we're adjust every month right on incentives to a variety of factors, including overall outlook, consumer confidence, payment levels, inventory competitive action. So we know how much of that would go and kind of increase in directly into higher incentive spend is hard to say intuitively say some of it would obviously, but very hard to say on a month on month basis.
Rod Lache
And okay. And then just big picture looking into next year, big focus right now on infrastructure spending get could you talk about any work you've done on the sensitivity for pickup truck demand against infrastructure and more broadly, I think you guys when you are forecasting for 2017, if I recall correctly used like 2.5% GDP growth, if GDP growth were to accelerate by 100 basis points do you have kind of where you see this, what would the sensitivity would be on the broader SAAR at this point in the cycle?
Mark LaNeve
I’m going to shift that one over to Brian.
Bryan Bezold
Thank you, Mark. I think one point I would make is that before we were to change our expectations or our guidance we have to have a better idea of what the set of policies would be proposed and eventually in active. So, I think that would be the first answer to your question. Generally of course anything that leads to faster economic growth, all of the things equal would be to faster industry volume and faster truck sales, but beyond that I don't have any detail for you.
Rod Lache
Okay. But you don't have any rules of some on dollar or infrastructure spending or any along those lines and how that specifically affects autos at this point?
Bryan Bezold
No, I do not.
Rod Lache
Okay. Right, thank you.
Bryan Bezold
Thanks Rod.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.
Colin Langan
Thanks for taking my question. Any color on the pace of sales through the month in particular anything following the elections? There was a lot of chatter that the election might have been sort of an overhang and with the result may be things picked up a bit or any color there?
Mark LaNeve
Colin it was, I would characterize the month as steady and then a pretty strong pose in the last month, certainly in our case, you not only have limited knowledge what the competitions pace is, but very strong close with all the Black - Black Friday has become one of the quarter stone kind of selling events in automotive calendar now. So, everybody was fairly aggressive out there as we were with both advertising and really good incentive offers for the customers. So it was a very strong close for Ford and I would say based on what I saw a steady, for the entire industry with a strong close across the board.
Colin Langan
And any thoughts you mentioned Black Friday, do you think the seasonal factors aren’t picking that up, now that it’s a bigger event over the last few years because the SAAR overall up pretty strong out there?
Mark LaNeve
I think it’s pretty well embedded in the seasonal factor. A lot of it depends on kind of where Thanksgiving hits in the - so early Thanksgiving, late Thanksgiving for that simple fact. A Wednesday close is typically not a great close day for the industry, but we certainly had a strong final three days, and I’m anticipating we’re going to see as we said with the beginning with the numbers fairly strong numbers from the industry, but I think effective Black Friday, it is fully simulated in the SAAR amount.
Colin Langan
Got it. So, why is you think number is so strong because you're expecting sales to fall next year, but I think you indicated [indiscernible]?
Mark LaNeve
I think somewhat is a really strong month, which is great. A little bit is year-over-year comparison. November, December last year really weren’t as strong as the preceding four, five months before them, you know strong as last year was, so I think a little bit of that and I mentioned that incentive spending was up for the industry, so year-over-year 570 is a pretty good number. We were up less than that, but as I mentioned a lot of the positives that are out there, consumers are in good shape, lot of great products out there, Black Friday promotions it was a strong month slightly above our internal forecast.
Colin Langan
Got it. And any color, you talked about earlier auto financing, there’s been chatter about subprime delinquencies spiking, are you seeing any issues getting customers financing is it getting more challenging or is it not really effecting?
Mark LaNeve
We’ve seen the articles, have seen one or two references and we’ve probably seen from a standpoint of Ford credit our delinquencies are in great shape, not running any different than they’ve run over the last several years and the quality of the customers that we are seeing and buying remains very consistent. So, we haven't really seen much evidence of what you are referencing.
Colin Langan
All right, thank you very much.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Kelia we are going to take one more call from the analyst community, before we turn it over to the folks in the media.
Operator
Okay and that will come from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets.
Joe Spak
Thanks good morning everyone.
Mark LaNeve
Good morning
Joe Spak
Just going back to the lease angle, I know you guys have shown your leasing mix has gone down certainly from earlier this year, but as the Lincoln has put up some good results here, should we expect that to, does that stabilize it or does that actually make leasing move a little bit north again?
Mark LaNeve
Lincoln is, obviously you get a higher percentage of leasing in the premium market, much higher actually then you do in the overall mainstream market. Lincoln's competitive with their lease percentage with the competition in terms of overall lease penetration and that today's relative volumes, I know it doesn't have the material effect on overall lease portfolio for Ford.
Joe Spak
Okay. And then one quick one, I noticed Transit was down this month, which I think is the first time I have seen it down in a long time if memory serves correctly, was there something unusual there was it a difficult, or is there some slowdown in that segment?
Bryan Bezold
No, I mean Joe, Transit is just running into some much more difficult comps. It has been doing great for us all year long, so when you look at transit year-to-date we are up 24%. So, it’s just an issue, its timing and running into some more difficult year-over-year comps.
Mark LaNeve
And we had a - Transit continues to be largely a commercial vehicles. We've done excellent with it as I've talked about probably excessively on these calls. We continue to grow the retail business so from our dealers and we actually had the terrific retail month with Transit that are sold to individual customers for personal use of what we call fleet deal of flower shop or small local business that’s looking for great commercial, I mean a great either cargo or passenger vehicle for the business. So Transit continues to be a good start for us. Just we are kind of fully loaded by this time last year, so we are running into a more difficult year-over-year comp.
Bryan Bezold
And just to put a number on that for Mark, our retail trends it was up 20% or so.
Joe Spak
Okay and then last one, do you have an estimate on model year 2016 versus 2017 mix for both sales and inventory?
Bryan Bezold
Yes, yes. So if we take a look at Model Year 2016 to 2017, we are looking at about, it is right around roughly the same as it is for sales and inventory. 2017 Model Year for Ford Motor Company overall represented about 46% of our sales and inventory last month, it’s almost 50%.
Mark LaNeve
Little close to a 50-50 mix at this point, which is normal for this time of the year.
Joe Spak
Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Bryan Bezold
Thank you, Joe.
Operator
That concludes the analyst portion of the call. We will now be moving into the media portion. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin from the Associated Press.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. I’m wondering if December can still be strong or if there is just too much of a pull ahead of sales in November because of Black Friday and all the deals. I mean I was reading that even in mid-November you know incentive levels were really high, I’m just kind of wondering how long that can last, or is December going to start being less of the big month that it has always been?
Mark LaNeve
Thanks for the question Dee-Ann, you know the Black Friday kind of November pushes, I wish I could tell how many years, but it’s been at least five or six now it has been a big focus for the industry may be longer, so almost like the similar question, I think the effect of Black Friday on November sales and then as they were pertain to or having an effect on December sales has been simulated by the industry and December has been a seasonally great month for the industry for the last several years and we anticipate it being another, relatively speaking from a seasonal basis very good month again this year. We know we’re going to continue to be aggressive in the market and we have great continuation of our year-end sales have been planned.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Thank you.
Mark LaNeve
Thanks Dee-Ann.
Bryan Bezold
Thanks Dee-Ann.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Christina Rogers of The Wall Street Journal.
Christina Rogers
Hi guys good morning.
Bryan Bezold
Good morning.
Christina Rogers
I just wanted to go back to the Edmond’s data on the negative equity and I was wondering if one of the issues here, as you are seeing a lot of people come in, they have cars and maybe their cars are not as worst as much as they thought and they wanted - but they still want to trade in for larger vehicle SUVs and trucks. Are you seeing more of that situation in particular and also is it becoming harder to put those deals together as resale values drop particularly on car models?
Bryan Bezold
Christina, thank you for the question. A certain percentage of customers being out of equity and there could be a number of reasons for them. They could have been how much they finance from the beginning, how many accessories were on the vehicle that they financed extended service contracts, and the overall credit rate it could be lots of reasons other than just pure residual values. That’s so much been in our industry forever. It has been creeping up lately, I wouldn't call alarming, I mean you'd like to see through the other way, but when we said that could be a perpetual cautionary headwind for the industry, but that’s what our dealers are really good at, as our Ford dealers are really good at working with the individual customers to get a financing program for them to get the kind of vehicle they want, give them the best possible value for the trade, that’s what they do every single day and as part of the strengths of having a franchise dealer network, and one is as strong as the Ford, as well as having a partner like Ford Credit. So, it’s something that we’re used to dealing within don't see as, you know anything alarming in any way right now.
Christina Rogers
And what are you - are you doing anything more for those customers to help dealers put those deals together, I mean are you offering any more trade and assistance anything like that?
Bryan Bezold
Well the overall incentive level in the marketplace for Ford and for the industry relatively high, which have been talked about obviously and covered well on these calls. We do get into data now, we do get in more specifically to some individual customer situations, but broadly speaking the overall incentive level in the industry part of the region is where it’s at, OEMs responding to the current volume levels and overall equity position of the customer. So, it is kind of fully accounted for that. We do specific things whenever it makes sense.
Christina Rogers
Okay, but specifically trade and assistance are you offering more of that or feel you have to offer more of that going forward?
Bryan Bezold
Not broad-based. If you think about say a normal tax rebate that could be years for customer in equity, out of equity it is just - the dealer is able to take, we give the dealers a whole floor of APR support, cash support, lease support sometimes we do individual programs on trade assistance and what have you but not in a broad-based way, but the dealer is able to take our whole portfolio of incentives and make it work to the specific customers exits in the best way possible.
Christina Rogers
And then just more broadly, I mean how do you think kind of the rising levels of negative equity will affect sales going forward for the industry or so for Ford?
Mark LaNeve
Yes that’s pretty much baked into our forecast. So, next year our guidance is for 2017 seven [ph] that’s one of the headwinds that is a little bit lower than this year's volume.
Christina Rogers
Got you. Thank you so much.
Mark LaNeve
Okay, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Keith Naughton of Bloomberg.
Keith Naughton
Hi good morning guys
Mark LaNeve
Hi Keith.
Bryan Bezold
Good morning, Keith.

Hey, so Mark you were talking about the SUV sales running at record levels looks like the F-Series had its best November in 15 years, yesterday OPEC approved its first production cuts in eight years, oil is already above $50. This morning on its way to $60 a barrel, according to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, so I’m wondering how much it will take before we will start seeing an impact on SUV and truck sales if gas prices rise?
Mark LaNeve
Thanks for the question Keith. I don't have a specific answer for you. I can tell you a couple of things is that, and I’ve talked a little bit about this in the past and somewhat not a specific to the OPEC action, but question is on the mix shift we have seen for really five years six years now from cars and SUVs and trucks is that, one of the reasons for that happening is the vehicles and SUV, obviously the benefits of visibility higher seating position utility in some case is better weather capability have always been there, but the customers don't make the trade-offs that they had to make time 5 years, 10 years ago in terms of our customers in terms of fuel economy technology right in handling.
So, with higher fuel prices will that put pressure in SUVs and cars logically yes, but I don't think it would be nearly - unless it was something fairly dramatic with nobody is forecasting. We don't think we would be nearly effected you have seen previously. Our line of trucks and SUVs is among most fuel efficient in the industry and customers largely, a lot of them are proper EcoBoost engines and customers appreciate that and don't really have to make the trade-offs that they had to make years ago, but the difference in fuel economy from a C size or B or C size card or utility is very minimal now.
Keith Naughton
Great. Thank you and then just a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier, did you see the election as a headwind and is consumer confidence rising and sales rising a result of that headwind going away?
Mark LaNeve
We're not changing our guidance in terms of the presidential election. Keith I can tell you that there is no real way to know, I mean I think November was strong partially because the competition was aggressive. The whole industry was aggressive and as I said sales were up $570 with a lot of promotional activity out there, good inventory situation for us. I mean we're very pleased with the month. As I did say it was slightly above our internal expectations, which is great, but there is no real reason to peg on - that we can peg it through other than, you know all the underlying factors that are positive and pretty aggressive market in terms of incentives.
Keith Naughton
Thank you, Mark.
Mark LaNeve
Thanks Keith.

Your next will come from the line of Megan Lampinen of Automotive World.
Megan Lampinen
Hi guys, I was interested in hearing your take on some comments that came, as typical further event in Germany a few days ago regarding the move up scale specifically with the Fiesta and ambitions to compete with luxury brand. Jim [ph] has probably had said that many field for the legitimate alternative for premium brand, is this something playing out in the U.S. as well?
Mark LaNeve
Thank you for the question. I am pretty U.S. focused here in my job. So I wasn’t at the event, although I did see some of the coverage, I was very proud of the Ford team in Europe and the exciting news around the new Fiesta. I can’t comment specifically on that. What commentary was made specific to the car market in Europe, I can’t tell you that we offer at Ford in terms of a brand in the U.S. market. We sell a fairly high percentage of up level series what we call them across our entire portfolio.
Our transaction pricing has exceeded the industry in terms of increases going all the way back to 2009, we transact at a very healthy level because the customer is choosing to upgrade to our higher level services and have great content, great technology, so in a way in terms of the main stream market in many ways we are appealing to our customers in a premium way, but we’re also always going to offer great value that’s part of our D&A, to provide great technology, great performance, and quality and efficiency for the masses.
And in addition unlike Europe, we do sell the Lincoln brand here. So, well they may have an interest in getting further upscale because not having the Lincoln, brand Lincoln is a big part of our business here in the United States.
Megan Lampinen
And just as a quick follow-up, can you share a little more details on how you expect the luxury segment to play out, I know you mentioned Lincoln vastly outperformed the rest of it in November, can you share how you expect that to play out moving forward?
Mark LaNeve
Yeah, we’ve seen fairly flat segmentation. Unlike the last economic growth cycle, the luxury segment expanded fairly dramatically, with this one it’s, has [ph] it has expanded as dramatically and in fact segmentations are relatively flat and we see it - we will see only major movement moving forward. Although we are delighted with how Lincoln is doing within the luxury segment.
Megan Lampinen
Okay. Thanks very much.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Kelia we are going to take one more call and then we’re going to wrap it up.

And that question will come from the line of Bernie from Reuters.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello and thank you.
Mark LaNeve
Good morning.
Bryan Bezold
Hi Bernie.

Hi good morning. Happy December. I was wondering and of course Mark you always say that rightly that you will adjust sales with - or supply with demand, I am wondering if your comments about the strength of SUV in truck sales partly because their handling capability is much better than they were a decade ago, kind of makes them immune from $10 spikes in the oil price or so, does that tell us that Ford is going to adjust supply with demand again for Compacts this calendar year, and I guess more broadly maybe this is a question for Mark Fields is U.S. production of compact cars doomed? Thanks.
Mark LaNeve
Bernie I would just say that, as you said thanks for the compliment, we do adjust continuously supply demand. The numbers that Eric gave at the beginning on a year-over-year basis in November were down roughly our overall inventory is down 10,000 units from a year ago, the cars are down 30,000 and we are about flat on trucks and up slightly on SUV. So, these adjustments come in on a month-to-month basis and we do adjusted to market our manufacturing team and our production forecasting team to do an excellent job of that, but we had no ways to see the current market going away, we actually got a pretty good car month in November and with [indiscernible] right down, but our retail performance was comparatively pretty good. And a fusion continues to be a tremendously hard vehicle in the marketplace. We had a increased retail sales that focus the MTS, which is our B&C entries. So we continue to be committed to that, you know that part of the market, but we are enjoying the mix shift why it happens because our makeshift in SUVs and trucks obviously plays very well to Ford’s strength and we will see any evidence of that seizing at this time.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thanks a lot.
