3 Kickstarter-Backed Films Earn Oscar Nods
Sprinkled among the high-budget films nominated for Oscars this year are three with humble financial beginnings. 
Inocente, Kings Point and Buzkashi Boys got monetary boosts from crowdfunding platform Kickstarter long before the Academy granted them nods at Thursday's nominations event. 
The flicks raised more than $90,000 from 558 backers on Kickstarter. Those projects' creators are just a few of the filmmakers who have raked in $102.7 million in pledges since 2009. 
"These are the fourth, fifth and sixth Kickstarter projects to be nominated for Oscars," said Kickstarter in a statement. "Incident in New Baghdad, Sun Come Up, and The Barber of Birmingham were all nominated in the past."

Inocente and Kings Point earned nominations in Best Documentary (Short Subject), while Buzkashi Boys got a nod in Short Film (Live Action).
No Kickstarter project has won an Oscar, but the Kickstarter folks have their "fingers crossed" that one will win this year. Winners of the 85th Academy Awards will be revealed Feb. 24.
The nearly $103 million figure above comes from 891,979 people, who helped fund one of 8,567 independent films, features, documentaries, shorts, web series or other video projects.

Singer/songwriter Amanda Palmer spent four years writing a record and putting her band together. Formerly part of the Dresden Dolls duo, Palmer broke away from a major record label to do her own thing. 
The album, supported by Kickstarter, was the first million-dollar music project on the platform. It debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Charts a few months later.

ArduSat is a tiny satellite that weighs no more than 1kg, but it has made a huge impact on the future of space research. Created by NanoSatisfi, this Kickstarter project went well beyond its $35,000 goal in just one month.
The project has democratized space exploration, making it feasible for anyone to run his own space experiment, depending on how many pledges he gets.

Brooklyn Castle is a documentary about after-school programs' effects on kids, teachers and schools. Production company Rescue Media relied on Kickstarter since the beginning of its creative inception in 2010, then again in 2011, when it was finishing the film. 
The award-winning film was already going to theaters in 2012, but the budget did not ensure the film would reach the very community it was intended for. Naturally, the team asked Kickstarter and the community came through once again. The film went on to show in 200 theaters across the country, and viewers who needed transportation to the screening were accommodated.

This was a particularly groundbreaking year for gamers on Kickstarter. One of the most important projects, Double Fine Adventure became the first multi-million dollar video game campaign.
The game reached its $400,000 goal in less than 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-funded projects on Kickstarter. Gamers suddenly realized their ideas were viable, and more campaigns like the ones for OUYA and Shadowrun Returns had the opportunity to shine.

An iPhone-friendly wristwatch, another seemingly simple concept, nonetheless blew up overnight. The makers at Pebble Technology had a modest $100,000 goal, but reached $1 million in a little more than a day.

What do New Yorkers want from an old, abandoned trolley terminal in the Lower East Side? Not more public transportation, but the world's first underground park.

3D printing is no longer just for architects and prototypes. Design duo Mary Huang and Jenna Fizel, co-founders of Continuum Fashion, want to help fashion lovers create custom garments by using an app. Every design is uniquely made to order.
Continuum used Kickstarter to host a private beta. Any pledge amount gave users priority access to the service.

In 2009, when Daniel Mustard was homeless, his cover of Radiohead's "Creep" went viral on YouTube. Mustard told Mashable the exposure gave him back his will to live.
Mustard lauched a Kickstarter project in July to pay for the cost of producing and distributing an EP. Most of the songs were inspired by his tribulations. The musician is no longer homeless, having found temporary access at shelters and using the Internet to mingle with fans at Apple stores.

The Elevation Dock was a simple concept with one main mission: to make docking an iPhone as seamless as possible, especially when the device is in a case. 
This was obviously a common problem among iPhone users. Designer Casey Hopkins and ElevationLab were the first million-dollar project on Kickstarter. And the dock set the bar for high-quality craftsmanship.

Online advertising has changed drastically from late '90s standards. Penny Arcade, one of the most popular gaming webcomics currently online, realized that web banners were no longer cutting it.
The site used Kickstarter to replace ad revenue with crowdfunding. The leaderboard on the homepage would be removed if they reached the minimum goal of $250,000, expanding to even more ad removal throughout the site as it surpassed higher goals.
