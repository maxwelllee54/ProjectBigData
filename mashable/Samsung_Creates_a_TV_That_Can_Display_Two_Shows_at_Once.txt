Samsung Creates a TV That Can Display Two Shows at Once
LAS VEGAS — If you've ever argued over who watches what in your house, has Samsung got a TV for you. The company's 55-inch "Real" OLED TV is the first consumer television that literally lets two people watch two different shows simultaneously.
How does it do such a thing? With a special muti-view feature, which adapts 3D technology to display a different image to the viewer depending on whether they're sitting to the left or the right of the screen. And yes, both will be at full 1080p resolution.
The big catch, of course, is that each viewer has to wear special glasses to see the proper image, not to mention get the right sound. Samsung has developed a new kind of glasses that works with both 2D and 3D material, and includes a pair of headphones tuned to whichever "channel" you're watching.
No price or availability yet on the KN55F9500, and it only comes in the 55-inch size — large for an OLED set, which are known for their thinner profiles and brighter displays. This set is also one of the first to pack a quad-core processor, a 1.35GHz chip based on ARM's Cortex-A15 architecture.
