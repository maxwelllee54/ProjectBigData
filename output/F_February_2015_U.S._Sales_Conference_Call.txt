Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford monthly sales call. My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Erich Merkle, U.S Sales Analyst. Please proceed.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Derek. Welcome everyone to Ford's February 2015 sales call and good morning.
Joining us today is Mark LaNeve, Ford's Vice President of U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service; and Yong Yang, Ford's Senior Economist for the Americas.
Yong is new to our call, but not new to Ford. Yong has worked in Corporate Economics at Ford prior to being named Senior Economist for the Americas. Yong served as Ford's Senior Economist for Asia-Pacific and China. So welcome, Yong.
So taking a look at the numbers here this morning, getting a look at the early morning data for February, we see overall industry sales, including medium and heavy trucks, totaling in the mid to perhaps the high-16 million vehicle range on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. On an absolute basis, we believe the industry sales were about 1.27 million to maybe 1.3 million vehicles total again and that amounted to a 4% to about a 7% increase versus February of last year.
Taking a look at some of the industry details, February was again a relatively soft month for small car sales, which represented just less than 19% of the overall industry. This compares to 20% last year. Small utilities are coming into tough year-over-year comparisons, but continue to gain ground. Last month, small utilities represented 18.5% of the overall industry, about a full higher compared to a year ago.
If you remember, we've targeted 2015 as the year that small utilities surpass small cars in overall share of the industry. Meanwhile, the full-size pickup trucks segment had a very good month, representing approximately 12.6% of the overall industry that compares to 12.1% for February 2014.
So taking a look at the industry and some of the various segments activity that we've seen over the month, now taking a closer look at Ford and Lincoln sales, let's turn things over to Mark. Mark?
Mark LaNeve
Thanks, Erich, and I'm delighted to be on the call with all of you again. And Dearborn, it's snowing like crazy today, so we're all looking forward to the spring hitting us. So if you're here, drive carefully. And if you're not, I hope the weather is better and warmer where you're at.
We take a look at our company results for February, we saw sales at Ford Motor Company totaled 180,383, that's a 2% decline in total from last year. Within those numbers, we were in line with last year or flat on retail basis, and we were down in fleet, which was planned timing what resulted in a decline on our fleet business.
Despite tight F-150 inventories, especially with the new 2015, we were really pleased with the strength of our retail truck performance, driven by strong F-Series retail performance and van strength. We continue to be strong with F-Series and early customer demand is really exceptional for our new F-150.
At retail, F-Series sales were up 7%, so a 7% increase in retail, and that was driven by customer demand for the all new F-150, while total sales were off just slightly. At 18 days to turn on dealer lots, that's a turn rate of the F-150 and continues to be the strongest turning product in our showrooms. And very encouraging is that premium turn level such as King Ranch we're turning in just 16 days and our Platinum edition in just 12 days.
As many of you know, Kansas City assembly plant, that's the second plant that will produce the new F-150, in addition the Michigan Truck is on track in its transition. We're now producing early bills and we're training employees on the manufacturing process of the all new F-150. We remain on plan and we expect to start F-150 production in Kansas City this month.
F-Series transaction prices increased last month by $1,600 that's total F-Series compared with the year ago. Overall, F-150 average transaction pricing increased by a larger margin of $2,000 relative to a year-ago levels, reflecting stronger transaction pricing and mix on the all new F-150.
As planned, we expect a solid stock position, although we're tight right now, we do expect that to continually improve, as we work through the next few months, and we expect a solid stock position by the end of the second quarter on the new F-150. Until then, as we have been, we'll continue to be disciplined and managing the transition of selling down the remaining 2014s and getting the system fueling up with the new 2015 and of course we're all looking forward to that.
Following up on strong results in January for van sales totaled 13,936 in February. This represents a 30% gain over last year for our best sales performance in vans since 2007. The gains are coming squarely from our newest van products. We sold 6,750 transit vehicles last month with Transit Connect sales up 25%.
Year-to-date through February, our van sales are over 27,000. This is a 34% increase and it represents our fastest van sales start to any year since 2001. Expedition was also very strong with sales up 16% total, better than that 22% up at retail with a dramatic increase in transaction process with new Expedition.
On the car side, I wanted to highlight the great market reaction to the all-new Mustang. In addition to a 32% increase in sales, the Mustang continues to bring a lot of excitement to our showrooms. We saw sales increases in every region of the country, which is if think about is really great for January and February in the Northern climates. We saw increases everywhere, every region that we have, and days to turn on dealer lot for Mustang is very close to that of the F-150. So it's turning incredibly fast.
California and Texas, which are our two largest Mustang markets continue to post very impressive gains. California dealers had an increase in Mustang in February of a 137%, while Texas dealers saw an increase of 44%, some two big numbers from two key states.
Explorer also just continues to perform exceptionally well with 32% increase over year ago levels, as we expand production of this vehicle. Our number for Explorer in February was our best performance since 2006.
Taking a quick look at Lincoln. Lincoln retail sales were up 3%. Fleet was off significantly, which was all planned, but retail was up 3%. We continue to be really pleased with the all new MKC. And the new Navigator had a great month, was up 96% in the month of February. We got a great plan for Lincoln and momentum is continuing to build as we execute that plan.
That's a short recap. And now I'd like to turn it over to Yong for an update on the economic front. Yong?
Yong Yang
Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. It is great to be on the call today. After a few months of strong economic data, you may have noticed that the recent economic news turned a bit mixed in the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the underlying fundamentals supporting growth in 2015 remains solid.
Growth in manufacturing sector is expected to pickup after some moderation in recent month. Despite the recent rebound, fuel prices remain low and continue to provide a significant boost to consumer disposable incomes. Employment conditions remain on a positive track. Inflation is well contained. Long-term interest rates are likely to remain low, given continued abundant global liquidity.
The second report of the fourth quarter GDP growth indicates that the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.2% annualized growth rate, down from the 2.6% growth rate previously reported, although, the growth rate has be revised downward. The details of the second report were generally encouraging.
Part of the downward revision is due to less inventory build up in the fourth quarter. This has set up a very favorable condition for the first quarter economic expansion. In addition, there was a significant upward revision to fixed investment, suggesting that the moderation in business investment cycle in prior months has stabilized. With strengthening consumer spending, we expect that GDP growth will likely rebound to the 2.5% of range in the fourth quarter 2015.
More importantly, the January Employment Report was a very positive. In January, the labor market added 257,000 new jobs with the upward revisions to December and November of 2014. Employment growth totaled about 1 million jobs in this three months leading up to January. This is an indication of accelerated labor market improvement in recent months.
In addition, wage growth also picked up to 2.2% on a year-over-year basis from a 0.2% contraction in December. As the slack in the labor market continues to diminish, wage growth is expected to firm up more in 2015. Of course, we are going to get a new reading on employment conditions at the end of this week.
The February Purchasing Managers Index came in at a 52.9, down 0.6 points from January. Nonetheless, the index remains comfortably in expansionary territory, suggesting that manufacturing activity continues to grow at a moderate pace. Raw material prices remain low, which represent a favorable factor to manufacturers.
With the labor dispute on the West Coast ports having been resolved, business environment is expected to be more supportive in coming month. As a result manufacturing activity will likely pick up slightly in coming month.
After reaching 11-year high, February, University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading eased 2.7 points from the prior month to 95.4, due to bad weather conditions in the Northeast region under the recent rebound in fuel prices. Despite of the easing, consumer sentiment really remains the highest since January 2007.
Vehicle buying assessments also remained positive, with close to 70% of consumers citing now as a good time to buy a vehicle. Fuel prices rose 19% after they troughed in January. As I mentioned earlier, rising fuel prices have to some extent negatively impacted consumer sentiment in recent weeks.
However, fuel prices are still about 35% below peak levels in June 2014. Lower fuel prices will continue to add additional spending power to consumers, and thus boost the overall economic growth.
We continue to expect 2015 industry sales remain in the range of 17 million to 17.5 million units, including medium and heavy trucks. Favorable economic fundamentals should support continued job growth and a good environment for vehicle buying.
To recap, as Erich mentioned earlier, February total industry sales were estimated in the mid-to-high 16 million range. It is more or less consistent with our expectations. As the economic conditions continue to improve throughout 2015, we expect industry sales will also strengthened accordingly.
With that summary, let me turn it back to Erich. Erich?
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Yong. And now we're going to take care of a few housekeeping items here, so if we take a look at our fleet as a percentage of our total sales. Turning to February of 2015. Take a look at our fleet as a percent of total sales, it was 30%. That's 14% for commercial, 5% of government, and 11% for daily rental. Comparing that to February of 2014, total was 32%; the commercial was 15%, government was 4% and daily rental was 13%.
Taking a look at calendar year-to-date through February, our calendar year-to-date through February 2015, our fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 29%; commercial was 13%, 5% for government and 11% for daily rental. Comparing that to year-to-date February 2014, we were at 29% for the total; 14% for commercial, 5% for government and 10% for daily rental.
Now, turning to gross stock. If we take a look at our gross stocks February 2015. For cars, it was 195,000 cars; trucks 240,000 trucks; utilities 168,000 utilities, giving us a total of 603,000 vehicles, translating into a days supply of 80. Comparing that to January of 2015, cars, we had 184,000 cars; 246,000 trucks; 169,000 utilities, giving us the total of 599,000 vehicles, translating into a days supply of 87. Taking a look at February 2014 last year, cars 247,000; trucks were 266,000; utilities 184,000, giving us a total of 697,000 vehicles, that translated into a days supply last year of 91.
So with the housekeeping out of the way, Derek, I'm going to turn it over to you, and see if we can take our first questions here from the analyst community, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.
Dan Levy
This is Dan Levy on for Brian. First, a couple questions here. First off, can you just tell us how much F-Series fleet sales were down? And do you think that fleet customers are waiting a little bit to check out the vehicle before placing large orders?
Erich Merkle
Dan, with that F-Series, when we start taking a look at fleet, yes, F-Series fleet is down. Retail was up. One of the things that we're seeing right now is we have one plant that's been providing F-Series, right, there's a new F-150, and we're committed to fill in our dealer lots, right now. We've got to get that taken care of first.
Mark LaNeve
Hopefully customers, Dan, they know that they've been well-informed of the timing and of the fill for 2015. So we don't feel that we're losing any fleet business because of the '15 getting ramped up. They're well aware of our timing, and that's all been sorted out with them.
Dan Levy
Can you quantify how much the fleet sales were down?
Erich Merkle
Sure, I mean, fleet for F-Series was down 18%. Retail though, it's important to remember was up 7%.
Dan Levy
And then the second question. I think in the past you've said that the percent of F-Series sales that were model year '15 versus model year '14. I apologize if I missed that earlier, but if you could just say what it was for this month? And just wondering, should that be a steady increase over next few months or will that be just a step function based on your production schedules?
Erich Merkle
Well, if we take a look at F-150, the Super Duty has changed over, that's not really a factor. But 2015 as a percentage of our retail, total F-150 sales last month was 21%. And you're correct, that will continue to change over as we are no longer making the old F-150. We are only making the new ones and we'll have Kansas City coming up as well.
Mark LaNeve
Yes, it will increase every month, Dan. I think January was like 12% or 13%.
Erich Merkle
It was 18%.
Mark LaNeve
It was 18% to 21%. It will continue to move up every month as we get more availability.
Erich Merkle
Derek, next caller please.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli, Citi.
Itay Michaeli
Sorry if I missed this, but do you have the ATP for the total company year-on-year and then kind of how you think the industry did last month?
Erich Merkle
Yes, sure. If we take a look at ATPs for Ford, all right, we were up about $1,500 year-over-year for Ford and the industry was up about $1,100, Itay.
Itay Michaeli
And just secondly, was there any geographic kind of differences in the months, just given the winter storms? I know you have a pretty strong position in the Northeast. Do you feel like there was any impact in the month from some of the weather?
Mark LaNeve
Texas was weaker than they typically are. We don't know how much was weather, but you got to believe there was some of the ice storms and things that it did had to have some impact on the business, but the only one that really looks kind of around is North Texas market, which is very significant market for us obviously.
Erich Merkle
Derek, next caller, please.
Operator
And the next question will be from the line of Dan Galves, Credit Suisse.
Dan Galves
It looks like the SAAR has started off the year a bit below company targets, but incentive activity has been very restrained. What do you think that this means for the spring selling season in terms of competitive activity? I mean, is the industry willing to kind of take low-16 million or lower-16 million type of SAAR numbers and kind of maintain the incentive activity where it is today?
Mark LaNeve
I can't speak for what the competition may or may not do, Dan, but we've had a very disciplined logical approach to the market. We've been very disciplined in managing the sell down of the -- we only had x number of 2014s available to us as we went through the dramatic transition to get to the new F-150, which is a significant piece of our business obviously. So we've got approach to the market that's disciplined and consistent. We plan on continuing to run our play and do business right way.
Erich Merkle
Also, I think it's important to keep in mind, Dan, we kind of go through this every year, I think, from an industry perspective. We look at January and February, we kind of think that that's the way the rest of the year is going to play out. But keep in mind that they are very week months relative to the rest of the months that we have coming out for the years. So I think it's really hard to hang any hat at this point on January and February.
Dan Levy
And just one additional one. You talked about the year-over-year pricing on F-150, or F-Series, in general, and we get some data on F-Series in total. It looks like versus October, November, December there really hasn't been much change in the pricing dynamic here. Is there any way you can talk to kind of transaction prices on new F-150 versus old F-150? And when do you expect us to start to see kind of an uptick in the pricing due to the new truck?
Mark LaNeve
Well, I mean, if you take a look, our average transaction prices on F-Series, it's been going up by a pretty substantial amount on year-over-year basis. So just last month, we're up $1,600 and up $2,000 year-over-year on F-150. So I think that that's pretty brisk. Now, with the new truck, it's right now 21% of our retail. So you're going to look at that change as we go through and we start adjusting, that mix starts to change as time goes on. We'll have a second plant running, so we'll get a better mix of F-150s going forward.
Erich Merkle
Next caller please, Derek.
Operator
And next question is from the line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.
Mike Levin
It's actually Mike Levin in for Rod this morning. So maybe just to quickly follow-up on Dan's question, can you guys give what the year-over-year ATP changes on just the new F-150, the 2015 model year?
Erich Merkle
We don't provide that number, Mike, but we're up $2,000 year-over-year on F-150 and the new one is 21% of the mix, so you can kind of back close to the map. So we're running a very rich mix, great customer acceptance, the dealers are absolutely thrilled, the customers are thrilled and we've seen very significant transaction price increases.
Mike Levin
And with the gains on small utilities that you guys have talked about. I understand Edge is going to be changing over to a new model. But can you kind of just talk about how we think about the performance in Escape and Edge in light of the performance of small utilities in the total market right now?
Mark LaNeve
We've got the Edge launch out in front of us, so we were down -- as part of planned transition, we had a decrease. It wasn't unexpected in the least, and so we're looking forward to getting the new Edge, which is really going to be exciting product for us. The mix on Escape year-over-year was mainly fleet, but obviously, we want to continue. It's been a very strong performer for us and it would be a big part of our plans for March and April.
Mike Levin
And then just maybe lastly, you've seen a competitor taking out changed production around some of their cars with building inventories. Obviously, at this point of the year we see weak car sales, but are you guys seeing any problems around inventory at this point?
Mark LaNeve
No. In fact, some of the segments that are running hot trucks and full-sized utilities, full-sized crossovers were many ways constrained in inventory to really take advantage of the market. So that all takes care of itself over the next three, four, five months, but we'd like to run harder and we will as we head into the summer.
Erich Merkle
We're going to take one last caller from the analyst community. Then we're going to switch it over to the folks in the media, Derek.
Operator
And John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch would be your next question.
Liz Suzuki
This is Liz Suzuki on for John. Last February, actually it looks like your small and mid-sized cars had a pretty tough month. Are you seeing more aggressive competition in that space or does it seem like those segments are struggling in general and consumers are favoring larger vehicle?
Mark LaNeve
I don't have all the industry numbers in yet, Liz, to look at the car line breakdown from our competition. Frankly, we would like to perform better in cars. Most of the performance year-over-year where we were down was fleet, but we've got plans to run strong with our car products in March and in April. And got to take a look at the overall industry, but obviously the hot part of the segment has been more in the utility part -- the hot part of market has been in the utility segment. So we need to run strong there with the market and continue to build up our car franchise.
Liz Suzuki
And you may have mentioned this and I missed it, but how much was fleet down in total for all segments?
Mark LaNeve
5% in total.
Erich Merkle
We're going to open up to the media now.
Operator
It will be from Christina Rogers, Wall Street Journal.
Christina Rogers
I just wanted to circle back on the F-series truck. I mean, the new truck has been on sale for three months now and it seems like sales are still pretty flat there. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit color behind that and also when do you really think sales of F-Series trucks will pick up?
Mark LaNeve
I don't have all the history, but the story is kind of like this, if you boil it down, is that we ran the truck plants full out last year. We had a very long transition of both of our trucks plants to convert to the all new aluminum alloy bodies. So we only had x amount of trucks to sell really over about a nine-month period. And with a very deliberate, very consistent, very discipline sell down plan of the '14s, while we're ramping up the '15, we have yet to produce a salable unit at the second plant that just started to happen in this month.
So it's really gone exactly as -- very seldom do plans play out like you put them on paper. This one has. And so our truck performances -- in fact, we have over performed with what the plans were, because we're turning at slightly higher rates than we anticipated. And we really feel like when we did the full production of the 2015 with adequate inventories with the dealers that will some time in early summer, that we'll understand at that point where we are, but we are very, very optimistic given initial reaction to the vehicle and turn rates.
Christina Rogers
Also, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the small cars. I mean, clearly that's been a tough market. What do you plan to do to relate -- you're talking about running strong with those products in March and April. What are you hoping to do there to help boost sale?
Mark LaNeve
Well, if you really look at our business, we are still strong in trucks and utilities. And we continue to build, what I call, our car franchise. We did over 300,000 Fusions last year, which is a big number for us, great product in the market. So Fiesta, Focus, especially the Focus, we want to continue to improve consideration. We don't want to buy the business, we want to earn the business the right way with product excellence and a great customer experience, and that's God's work.
I mean, we're working on all the time, get the right message in the marketplace, have good alignment between our national messaging and our local dealer ad group messaging, and make sure that they're taking advantage of every opportunity. So that business is a great opportunity for us on the car franchise to continue to improve and build our brand.
Erich Merkle
And keep in mind, Christina, we're going to run -- we're very discipline. So as we go through cars, we know that the cars segment has really been coming down more in favor of utilities. So we're always going to build to demand. So right now, the market is really starting to favor utilities, and we're doing everything we can to keep up to that demand and also keep our share on the car side.
Derek, next caller please.
Operator
Your next question will be from the line of Nick Bunkley, Automotive News.
Nick Bunkley
I have a question about the F-150 ATPs, you said it was up about $2,000 year-over-year. And is it both due to stronger mix and just higher pricing in general. Can you give any more detail as to which of those is a bigger factor and just what you're seeing in terms of those higher trim levels and how they're going over?
Mark LaNeve
Thanks for the question, Nick. It'd be a combination of running a really rich mix on the new 2015. Actually we're on a pretty decent mix on the '14. Although, it is what it is, because they've been completely build out. And our variable incentive spending is down significantly on the new 2015, as you would expect. Pricing is out there, I mean you know what pricing is. So rich mix and lower incentive spend.
Nick Bunkley
As far as those higher trim levels, the Platinum and the King Ranch and everything, are just a lot more people choosing those than the 2014 and earlier? [multiple speakers] and continue after the early ones.
Erich Merkle
Nick, it's really early to tell on that. Yes. It's early to tell you yet on that, because right now I mean we have one plant that's Dearborn, and the mix is very rich. What's very encouraging with that rich mix is the strong base to turn on both the King Ranch and the Platinum.
Mark LaNeve
So to some extent, Nick, its customer choice and to some extent it's what's available. But the good news is that whatever is available in dealer lots is turning incredibly quickly with a high degree of customer acceptance. So that's all good.
Erich Merkle
Derek, next caller please.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Alisa Priddle, Detroit Free Press.
Alisa Priddle
It's Alisa here. So Mark you're relatively new into this latest posting, I'm just wondering, as you look at sales do you have new strategies, new ideas you want to bring to Ford or are you confident with the plan that's in place and you just want to execute that.
Mark LaNeve
I'd characterize it is very new, still trying to find the parking lots and things like that. But mainly, in a month I'm getting used to the rhythm and sense for the numbers, and getting to know my team and the dealers, all of which I am incredibly thrilled with and delighted to be a part of.
I kind of mentioned it earlier. I think the main -- we've got gold standard in the truck business by anywhere you measure it. And we're the volume leader in utilities. We think we've got room to grow there with a very precise focus on the way we go to market with our Ford utilities on the Ford side, which are all sensational products, big opportunities on cars.
And over many, many years our market position there it's different than it is in trucks and utilities, so we think we've got huge upside. We've got great product. We've got dealers that excited about selling it. We've got Mustang. It's going sensationally well to add excitement and image leadership to our showrooms on the car side.
And so a big part where the team and I are focused on now is really running the playing cards and trying to build that part of our business up, so that it performs as well in the marketplace as our truck and utility franchises do. There's a lots of other stuff moving forward. And the plants that were in place, where Ford is an exceptionally well-run company, done a terrific job. And I've been delighted with everything I've seen in my first month.
Alisa Priddle
Now on the Lincoln side, the MKZ, which was always been with such a big part of the Lincoln come back and that's really falling down. Can you talk a little bit about what's going and there and how do you want to tackle that?
Mark LaNeve
Well, I think, what we really try to focus on is that Lincoln is -- the Lincoln plan is a long-term plan. And I've got a lot of experience over my career with luxury brands. In rebuilding a premium luxury brand in this business, especially it's now global and we've got big aspirations for China. In addition, in North America, it's a long-term proposition.
From what I have seen in terms of the things you need to do to focus on residual value to customer experience, Lincoln is doing all the right things. We had an increase in retail by 3%. It's been a string of monthly increases, some very significant. We were down at fleet, huge in February, but it's irrelevant to our luxury brand, what the fleet performance is. So you really got to focus on the retail number. And as we balance out all of our car lines, we're looking to continue to grow Lincoln, which we're doing, and stay very disciplined to the plan, which we're going to do I can assure you.
Erich Merkle
Derek, we're going to take one more call, and then we're going to wrap the call up.
Operator
The last question will be from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin, AP.
DeeAnn Durbin
Everybody is coming in lower across the board than the analyst have been predicting. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of sales over the month and if February ended a little softer than we thought it was going to? And also if you saw any discernible impacts from the really rapid rise of gas prices out in California in last month?
Mark LaNeve
There was definitely a slowdown from about the 20th on in the month. I don't know. I haven't seen all the numbers coming from the competition yet, but from what I have seen, it seems like it was industry-wide. Why? I don't know. I quit trying to explain the weather and its impact many, many years ago. So I really can't attribute to one thing or another. Don't know on the gas price. Maybe somebody in the room can help with that. But I don't think there is any question, the industry slowed a little bit in the last week.
Erich Merkle
I'll take the one on the segmentation Dee-Ann with the gas prices. We haven't seen any change in the segmentation. It was very much in line with what we had seen before gas prices had dropped off so dramatically. And now that gas prices are coming back a little bit, we're still seeing a growth in the small utility segment coming at the expense of small cars and to a certain extent mid-sized cars as well. And trucks, we continue to -- the industry had a good truck month, all things considered. And I think a lot of that is more cyclical due to the function of the overall economy.
Mark LaNeve
And the West versus our internal objectives, the West was our best performing region. So we didn't see any particular impact from anything related to gas prices in the West, Dee-Ann. West performed very well for us.
End of Q&A
Erich Merkle
Well, with that, Derek, thank you for working with us here today. We really appreciate your help. And thank you everyone for joining our February sales call. We look forward to talking everybody next month in the April for March's sales call. Thank you very much. Have a good day.
Mark LaNeve
