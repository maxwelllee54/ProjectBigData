CES Challenge Day 3 Shatters Previous Records
We've been tracking our Mashable team members at CES 2013 in Las Vegas as they all dash across the convention center in pursuit of the newest tech trends. Outfitted with Nike+ Fuelbands, our reporters and editors have had their every move monitored. We've compiled the totals of the first three days of the challenge to show who's leading the overall competition.
The Mashable team's mileage at CES by the end of Tuesday, day three of the challenge: 

Reporter Samantha Murphy beat video editor Evan Engel's previous single-day record of 5.59 miles, completing 5.85 miles on Tuesday. She was closely followed by tech editor Pete Pachal, who completed 5.72 miles. Both Pete and Samantha spent time at the Panasonic event, where they were introduced to the gigantic 20" 4K tablet. 
Pete started the day by hanging out with Sony COO Phil Molyneux, and later stopped by Samsung to check out its new point-and-shoot cameras and pioneer curved OLED TV. He, along with lifestyle editor Andrea Smith and photo editor Nina Frazier, caught up with Ro Marley to talk sustainable tech. 
Reporter Emily Price had an impressive 4.88 mile day that included an interview with 50 Cent and a stop at Verizon's keynote. 
Evan, who covered 5.02 miles on Tuesday, still leads the group in the overall competition. He was also on the scene for the 50 Cent interview: 
Just shot an interview with 50 Cent. Nine times.
