Turn Your Kid's Drawings Into 3D-Printed Sculptures
If a kid's drawing is good enough for the fridge, then it's probably also worth making it into a sculpture that can be displayed on desks and shelves. For about $130, Crayon Creatures will create bespoke figurines based on your child's drawings.
Just launched last week, the company has already gained the attention of enthused parents worldwide. Crayon Creatures will take any 2D drawing, model it on a software and produce it using a 3D printer. As each figurine is personalized, the whole process can take up to three weeks start to finish.

The idea behind Crayon Creatures reminds us of Child's Own Studio, where a kid's hand-drawn character is made into a stuffed toy.

As the cost of 3D printers continues to drop, a lot of other similar concepts have popped up â€” and not just for children. As The Verge notes, a service called Printcraft lets Minecraft players turn their designs into 3D-printable files. Doodle3D is also another software that creates 3D versions of simple line drawings.
