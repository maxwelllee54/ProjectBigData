Live From Samsung's 2013 CES Press Conference
LAS VEGAS — 2012 was a big year for Samsung, with a number of innovative product announcements and releases.
The company took the Android smartphone market by storm with the release of the Galaxy S III, and released the Galaxy Camera, a digital point-and-shoot camera that runs on Android.
So, what does the company have in store for 2013? You can bet there will be a ton of home theater products, including a number of televisions â€“- maybe even a 4K TV, similar to the Ultra HD 4K TV shown off by Toshiba Sunday evening.
We could also potentially see a new smartphone or two, or even a new tablet.
