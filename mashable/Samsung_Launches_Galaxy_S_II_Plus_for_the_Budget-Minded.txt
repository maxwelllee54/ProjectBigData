Samsung Launches Galaxy S II Plus for the Budget-Minded
Samsung has launched Galaxy S II Plus, a new smartphone that is essentially an update to the now very dated Samsung Galaxy S II. 
The 4.3-inch phone sports a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, 480 x 800-pixel screen resolution, an 8-megapixel camera on the back and a 2-megapixel one on the front. It also offers 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage memory that can be expanded with microSD cards. 
The S II Plus runs on Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), and supports HSPA+, GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and an option for NFC.
Exact pricing and availability of Samsung's Galaxy S II Plus have not yet been announced, but given the middling specs, we assume the price will be on the cheap end of the spectrum.
