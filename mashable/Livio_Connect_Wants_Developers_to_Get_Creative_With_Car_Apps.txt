Livio Connect Wants Developers to Get Creative With Car Apps

Livio Connect introduced freemium pricing for app developers at the 2013 International CES in an effort to expand beyond music apps for 2013 and the future.
"Going freemium was an easy decision for us," Livio founder and CEO Jake Sigal said during a news conference at the show. "Our new model allows us to work with app developers of any and every size, at a price they can afford. As their automotive business grows, we participate in their success.â€
Sigal said the 2013 additions to the network will expand the in-vehicle infotainment offerings beyond music apps like Pandora and Spotify to include traffic, parking, weather and navigation.

Sigal said people want to be able to use apps in their car and, while vehicles today have infotainment, if it's not what you enjoy using, it's useless. "Consumers want to bring their phones into cars," he told Mashable, "we just want to find a safe way to bring that in."
When asked about the safety of using apps — and phones — in cars, Sigal said their job is to "provide the tools to allow OEMs to control the experience for the consumer while maintaining the branded presence of your favorite apps with your favorite buttons and favorite commands."
In other words, he said, "I don't expect to see Angry Birds anytime soon in the vehicle, and you might Facebook yourself into a tree if you're driving down the road but I think we're offering a safe way for OEM's to have control over safety."
Livio Connect also showed off the new FM Connect, which enables in-car FM radio listeners to gain an enhanced experience through a Bluetooth-connected smartphone.
