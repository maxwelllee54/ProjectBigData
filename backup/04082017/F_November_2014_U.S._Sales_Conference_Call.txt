Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Call. My name is Crystal and I will be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Erich Merkle, U.S Sales Analyst. Please proceed, sir.
Erich Merkle - U.S. Sales Analyst
Thank you, Crystal and welcome. Good morning, everyone to Ford’s November 2014 sales call. I am joined today by John Felice, Ford’s Vice President, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service and Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford’s Chief Economist.
After reviewing this morning’s data early, we estimate overall sales for November, including medium and heavy trucks totaled in the mid 17 million vehicle range on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. Absolute sales would equate to about 1.3 million giving us an industry increase of about 3% compared to November last year. Retail sales for the industry represented approximately 83% of total sales with the retail industry SAAR operating what we believe to be in the low to mid 14 million vehicle range. We expect the full year to finish up approximate – finish up at approximately 16.8 million vehicles, about 900,000 vehicles more than in 2013.
Taking a closer look at a few of the segment details, we have been getting a lot of questions around lower fuel prices and the impact that is having on segment trends. So, we thought it might be worth some time discussing it today. When you take a look at small utilities, they have been relatively what we would deem as fuel price neutral. Small utility vehicles continue to grow as a percentage of the overall industry, a trend that began as early as 2004. The growth has accelerated this year with November being no exception.
The small utilities segment represented 17.3% of industry last month, which beat October’s reading of 16.8% and is a full 2 points higher than year ago. Small utilities are a long-term trend driven by baby boomer population moving towards Empty Nester status. Full-sized pickups represented 12.7% of industry in November, which is lower than October’s 13.5%, but stronger than November 2013, which was at 12.2%. The slight decline in November is consistent with the typical seasonal patterns that you might see at this point in the year.
Segments that seem to be the most adversely affected by falling fuel prices are small cars. Industry-wide small cars fell to under 19% of the industry in November, down more than a full point from share a year ago. With fuel prices, we suspect small cars, while remaining a significant segment, will be relatively flat as a percentage of the overall industry at just under 20%. Next year, small utilities could very likely surpass the small cars segment, which we classify as B&C segment cars combined.
So, that gives you kind of a look or a wrap of kind of what the segmentation is doing. So, now to give you a closer detailed look at Ford and some of the things that we saw at Ford in the month of November, I am going to turn things over to John Felice. John?
John Felice - Vice President, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service
Well, thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Last month, sales at Ford Motor Company totaled 187,000 vehicles, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Breaking down the numbers, our fleet sales were up 3%. Year-to-date, we are up 2% on commercial business and 16% on government, but down 16% in daily rental. As we have discussed all year, we have been pulling back on daily rental portion of our business. We are now at a point where we will begin to see some stability in our daily rental business. The data as always will be a bit up and down with some months reflecting increases and other months showing declines, but reasonably steady on a moving average basis going forward.
As we have discussed prior to and throughout the transition to our all new F-150, we expect retail sales will continue to be tempered by lower F-Series volume. We have reported a handful of our first sales of the all new F-150 at the end of last month. We are really excited to start getting the all new F-150 to our dealers and to customers. From late September through the month of November, we have now registered a total of 592,000 build-and-price exercises on the 2015 F-150 via the Ford website. This is about 112,000 more than we stated just a couple of weeks ago when we were at the LA Auto Show.
Overall, our retail sales for the month declined 3% with 142,262 vehicles sold, which is more than explained by a 14% reduction in F-Series retail volume against the strong comp a year ago. As discussed, we will continue to manage our 2014 inventories with incentive spend, while moving through two plant changeovers. F-Series sales overall were down less than 10%, which was offset by the strength of our commercial business. Until the changeover is complete, we will continue to see F-Series temper sales as our next step calls for changeover at Kansas City assembly plant in the first quarter of next year, with Dearborn-produced F-150s continuing to arrive in dealerships throughout the nation this month as planned.
Looking at car performance, Mustang had a real breakout month. Sales of Mustang shot above 8,000 vehicles in November, a 62% increase for the car’s best November since 2006. And what’s fascinating about that comparison to 2006 is that’s our biggest or is that our biggest competitors at that time, Camaro and Challenger, were not even in the segment at that time. Mustang retail sales growth was strong all around the country with our largest market for Mustang Texas up 46%, while our second largest market California was up 76%. Both dealers and customers love the all-new Mustang as it’s turning in just 8 days on dealer lots.
Taking a look at utilities, Escape reported a record November sales going all the way back to its launch in 2000 with 25,528 vehicles sold. This equates to an increase of 22% year-over-year. Explorer, America’s bestselling mid-size utility sold 14,949 vehicles last month, equating to a 13% increase over last year and its best November since 2004.
Turning to vans, transit van sales momentum continues to build as we have been ramping up on many of the different variants. Transit sales totaled 4,851. It is our highest sales level since its launch early this year and we anticipate that momentum will continue carrying into December and into 2015. Taking a look at Lincoln, Lincoln sales were up 21% last month giving the brand it’s best November results going all the way back to 2007. You can see momentum really built for Lincoln as we close out the year. The last two months, Lincoln’s monthly sales increases have significantly outpaced year-to-date results of up 15%.
MKC continues to grow reporting another sales month above 2,000 vehicles sold mark. Last month was no exception with 2,152 vehicles sold. In addition to MKC, Navigator was up 88%, with 1,433 vehicles sold in November. It’s good to see Lincoln’s newest product, MKC, performing so well in the market and really lifting the brand. As we have stated throughout the year, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our business throughout all of these transitions. We have inventories that are in very good shape as we continue to introduce a record number of new products. It is a very exciting time for us.
That’s a quick look at Ford and Lincoln. And with that, I’d like to turn things over to Emily for an update on the economic front. Emily?
Emily Kolinski Morris - Chief Economist
Great, thank you very much, John. Well, despite the reports that we have seen of soft Black Friday weekend sales, vehicle sales did not disappoint consistent with our positive outlook for the consumer in the near-term. Lower energy prices and still low interest rates combined with ongoing improvements in the labor market supports this outlook. Taking this into account, it seems like a possible narrative when retail sector analysts suggest that some Black Friday shopping was simply pulled ahead by earlier November promotion.
Our near-term outlook for the U.S. economy remains positive at a pace of around 3% based on some fundamental factors. First, falling commodity prices represent a financial windfall for customers, supporting further gains in consumer confidence. Manufacturing indicators remain positive, while breakeven levels for energy production appear to be a bit lower than previously estimated and labor market indicators continue to show signs of steady though modest improvement.
Let’s look briefly at some of the details. The November Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing is just slightly falling 0.3 points to 58.7, still near its recent peak and with continued strength in new orders boding well for future manufacturing activity. Lower commodity prices are already driving a substantial decline in the prices component for raw materials moving that sub-index favorably by 9 percentage points in November. The lower commodity prices today generate an additional consideration compared with historical performance given the increase in energy production in the U.S. over the past decade. But recent assessments of breakeven prices for non-conventional oil sources suggest these levels may be lower than previously thought, perhaps as low as $60 for some new sites.
In this case while there is the potential for new projects to be delayed, it appears that much of the existing activity will be maintained at least at current prices. To the extent that some declines do occur in the energy sector, the net effects on the U.S. economy are still positive, notably benefiting consumers both here and around the globe. You can pick your favorite metric on this but by any measure households are reaping significant disposable income gains each week at current gas prices. With U.S. gasoline consumption of over 360 million gallons a day that represents the total savings of about $180 million per day now versus our September sales call just a few months ago.
The final November reading from the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at 88.8 remained above its long run average and is at its highest level since July of 2007. Importantly younger and lower income households are now seeing improved personal financial condition, in part due to lower energy prices. And assessments of vehicle buying conditions are at their highest level since 2005 with rising confidence in income prospects supporting this assessment in addition to low prices and interest rates.
As Erich mentioned earlier October total industry sales are estimated in the mid-17 million units range at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and including medium and heavy truck. Based on this estimate the six months moving average of sales would rise to about 17.2 million units supported by the good macroeconomic fundamentals we have just discussed. So our industry sales projections remain as indicated previously with U.S. total industry sales at around 16.8 million units this year and in a range of 16.8 million to 17.5 million units for 2015 again including medium and heavy truck.
So with that summary let me turn it back over to Erich.
Erich Merkle - U.S. Sales Analyst
Thank you, Emily. And to go over some housekeeping items we are going to start off with our gross stock inventory. So if we take a look at November of 2014 in terms of cars we had 180,000 cars gross stock, trucks 267,000, utilities 166,000 giving us a total of 613,000 vehicles, translating into days’ supply of 79. Taking a look at the previous month, October 2014 cars were at 172,000, trucks 279,000, utilities 163,000 giving us a total of 614,000 vehicles and translating into 88 days’ supply. Comparing November of this year to last year November of 2013 cars stood at 236,000, trucks 268,000, utilities 178,000 giving us a total at that time of 682,000 vehicles, translating into 89 days’ supply.
Taking a looking at our fleet as a percentage of our overall sales, when we look at November of this year fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 24%, commercial was 12%, government was 5% and daily rental was 7%. We compare that to November 2013 one year ago fleet as a percentage of our overall sales was 23%, 12% for commercial, 5% for government and 6% for daily rental.
Going on to calendar year-to-date, if we take a look at fleet as a percent of our overall sales calendar year-to-date through November of 2014 was 28%, commercial was 13%, government was 6%, and daily rental was 9%. November 2013 calendar year-to-date 29% was total, commercial was 13%, government was 5%, and daily rental was 11%, okay.
So, with the housekeeping items out of the way, we are going to open the line up and start taking some calls from the analyst community. Crystal, could you help us out with that please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please proceed.
John Murphy-Bank of America
Good morning, guys. Just a first question for you, Emily, given the strength that we have seen more recently in the economy indicators as they have been coming in, is there any reason to think or is there anything on the horizon that concerns you that would drive a slowdown in auto sales in the next 6 to 12 months?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Well, John, you are right. I mean, the fundamentals are really pretty strong. So, I think the potential to withstand some of the potential shocks that are still out there is pretty good. We certainly are a little bit concerned about the demand side drivers of low oil prices and they are reflecting to some degree the fact that demand is slowing in many of the major markets around the world, particularly in the emerging markets. But given the U.S. export exposure that really shouldn’t have much of a direct hit to U.S. growth, certainly you have ongoing geopolitical risks that can always cause some disruptions in financial markets and then the potential that we get some volatility around rising interest rates as that begins to materialize likely around the middle of next year. So, I mean, there are some things to keep an eye on, but again, I think the underlying fundamentals are strong enough that we would be able to withstand some of these events.
John Murphy-Bank of America
Okay. And then just a second question for Eric and John probably for both of you, as we look at the large pickup truck segment, your competitors had fairly strong months. I was just curious as you look at this, was there any pricing action that was taken by your competition that would have driven sales much higher or is that just representative of the strength on the large pickup truck market and right now you are inventory constrained going through this and you would have seen similar strength had you had the inventory in place if the changeover was not taking place?
John Felice
Yes, John, this is John, a good question. I would say the fundamentals from full-size pickup remain very strong overall. All the things we have talked about on this call and prior with housing improving, fuel prices coming down has been really positive in the overall economic conditions for a full-size pickup. It was down sequentially from October and November, that’s very typical seasonal, but up on a year-over-year basis. So, very – fundamentals are strong in full-size pickup. In our case as we have stated, we are managing very carefully through the transition of our new pickup. We are very excited that everything is on plan and we are selling a new 2015 F-150, but that’s going to continue into next year as we go through transition at both plants. So, it’s a delicate balance. We have been very disciplined with our incentive spend and transaction price in full-size pickup.
John Murphy-Bank of America
I mean, could you talk about just the average transaction prices you are seeing in the large pickup segment, is there anything that’s been going on, as far as price cutting to drive these sales, or are we just seeing strength in the fundamentals, if you could just talk about the ATP?
John Felice
John, the average transaction price in the full-size pickup truck segment has really been healthy. In fact, if you were to take a look at it, I am just going to dig it up here a second right now, but ours are continuing to run above $40,000 per truck and it’s about $2,100 higher than a year ago and that’s pretty much in line with the segment. It’s a little over $2,000 more than it was a year ago. So, the average transaction prices I would say are the most healthiest in the pickup truck segment than any other segment in the industry right now.
John Murphy-Bank of America
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
John Felice
Okay, thank you, John. Crystal, next caller please.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Erich, how much of F-Series sales are sold into domestic oil and gas industry?
Erich Merkle
Adam, we don’t have a full breakdown of that. It’s really difficult to determine, but I do know that the correlation is very strong, very strong with new home starts, okay.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Okay, alright. How about then – I mean, you were breaking out sales by state for Mustang, do you have – can you give us similar exposure for full-size pickups in states like Texas, for example?
Erich Merkle
Well, I don’t have a breakdown for every vehicle by state with me, Adam.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Got it.
Erich Merkle
We did call out Mustang, because it was – it’s a new vehicle that’s been performing very well for us, particularly in states like California and Texas.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Okay.
Erich Merkle
But as it relates to pickup trucks, Texas is by far the biggest pickup truck market in the country that would be followed by second would be California and third is Florida. Don’t make me go any further than that though.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
No, I won’t, just in case you had it. And can I just ask, I mean, it’s obviously a fall in fuel prices is good for mix in terms of shifting people up to larger vehicles or taking a bit off the smaller vehicle, but overall in terms of volume, we have heard in recent years as oil prices and gas prices were relatively elevated, many of your dealers were saying that was actually good for volume, because it created a sense of urgency to trade in the old piece of crap and buy a new fuel-efficient Ford vehicle. I was just wondering if you have kind of felt – if you got a view on whether, let’s say, $2 or mid $2 gasoline was – what the overall volume impact, irrespective of mix. Is it neutralized, is it positive, negative, or any conclusion?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Yes. Adam, I think on net, really in either direction we see the impact on the industry as primarily through segmentation and not through the overall industry level.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Got it. Okay.
Emily Kolinski Morris
Certainly, the financial benefit to consumers that we are seeing from these significantly low prices does have the potential to feed into higher economic activity, which could be supportive of sales that would be the primary factor there.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Great, I appreciate that. And just finally what type of competitive response are you expecting by your competitors as the new F-150 as it becomes more available and starts taking share? Just in qualitative terms, I was curious have your – are you expecting – what kind of response basically in terms of deals and trying to sabotage you kind of thing or not? Thanks.
Erich Merkle
We don’t really have any idea. We are just going to have to wait and see. We sold a handful of new F-150s last month, but we still have long ways to go with the transition everything that John spoke of, but we are going to have to wait and see and take it as it comes. It’s a very fluid and dynamic industry.
Adam Jonas-Morgan Stanley
Yes, that’s a great product too. Thanks very much guys and good results.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Adam.
John Felice
Crystal, next caller please.

Our next question will come from the line of Dan Galves from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Hey, good morning.
John Felice
Hi, Dan.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Hey. Just had a follow-up question on oil prices, have you seen any change in the penetration of some of your more fuel-efficient engine types? So, maybe I know you used to call out on EcoBoost penetration on F-Series, has there been any change in kind of what people are choosing in terms of engines?
John Felice
Yes, Dan. We haven’t seen a noticeable change in engine mix of late in terms of overall performance. As Erich touched on and Emily to some degree, we do see as few fuel prices decline some segmentation shifts to SUVs and trucks. I think importantly the data we have seen even if it’s high fuel price environment or low fuel price environment, consumers still want great deal economy and capability. So, coming back to like the all new F-150, it’s still the perfect time to launch that type of product.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Okay, got it. And then I just had a couple of questions on the pricing environment, in terms of rental sales, I mean, you guys were already last year kind of below your competitors in terms of rental as a percentage of the business. Can you talk about why you decided to kind of take sales down again in 2014? Is that any indication on kind of what pricing in the rental market is doing? And then also on the Q3 earnings call someone from Ford’s management team talked about currency advantages for the Japanese OEMs, can you talk about how that’s impacting you and whether you think that the issue becomes more difficult over time?
John Felice
Sure thing, Dan. I will take the first one on the rental business and just the kind of dimension, this year on a year-to-date basis were slightly over 40,000 units down in rental. And that was a conscious decision coming into this year to part of our residual strategy to improve the residual values and values to consumers and then also in some key segments, where we have retail demand, like Escape and the segments we have talked about in our products, that are doing very well in the marketplace. We are moving that production into retail. So, it really comes back to improving retail residual values, having more availability to sell in more profitable channels.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Okay, got it.
Emily Kolinski Morris
And on the currency question, I mean I think clearly the weak yen provides some additional tailwinds for Japanese manufacturers in terms of their ability to price competitively. But we have really seen that trend regardless of the currency value this year as the industry has gotten closer to what we have spoken before towards the plateau. You always expect to see very intense competitive activity in that environment and we certainly see that continuing.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Okay, thanks. And just following up on the rentals are you saying that that pricing – rental pricing has remained pretty strong?
John Felice
I will only speak to our business. It’s a good business for us but we do it with discipline. And overall the rental industry is relatively flat I believe overall on a – in a total basis. But again we have made a conscious decision to pull back a bit this year. But the pricing environment for us has been very, very balanced.
Dan Galves-Credit Suisse
Okay. Thanks very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Dan. Crystal we are going to one more caller from the analyst community then we are going to turn it over to the folks in the media.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] signing in for Joseph Spak. Just a question on F-150 $3 gas prices and how that affects marketing, I know you mentioned that it’s still good time to launch F-150 as the consumer still wants fuel efficiency but just does it alter your marketing strategy in anyway?
John Felice
Well, this is John Felice. Not at all I mean for us when you look back at the data over time whether it’s a high price or a low priced fuel environment, truck customers want capability, quality and fuel efficiency regardless if its $2 gas or $4 gas. So for us we think it’s the perfect time to launch the all-new F-150. We are delivering fuel efficiency across the range improvements of 5% to 25% – 29% EPA. So again, not only about the fuel efficiency improvement but by the light weighting and giving 700 pounds of benefit and capability to consumers along with the technology advancements it’s the perfect time to launching F-150.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Erich Merkle

[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Mike Ramsey with Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.
Mike Ramsey-Wall Street Journal
Hey guys. I am just curious if you can kind give me a sense of when if the market keeps growing when you can expect to start to see sales increases rather than I mean right now you are in a period of market share decline, we all knew is coming, you have talked about a lot, when do you estimate that you will start to see sales increases?
John Felice
Yes. Mike this is John speaking, as we mentioned right now we are in the one of the biggest launch years in the history of our company. So we are working through some very big transitions right now and a big one for us on the volume basis was the F-150. As we mentioned we are up and running now at DTP Dearborn Assembly and we will be going to the transition early next year in Kansas City, Kansas City Assembly Plant. But that transition will take us well into next year. So it’s difficult to point to a specific number. The good news is again with the launch on plan and the number of products we have coming in next year, it sets up well for us in 2015 to improve on our sales momentum.
Mike Ramsey-Wall Street Journal
So you think by the end of the year for sure, but you are not sure what months it will be February or March before you could reasonably?
John Felice
Yes. It’s tough to put a point estimate on it Mike again that right now for the next several months we will be working through the transitions.
Mike Ramsey-Wall Street Journal
Alright. Thanks.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Thank you, Mike. And Crystal next caller please.

Our next question will come from the line of Keith Naughton from Bloomberg. Please proceed.
Keith Naughton-Bloomberg
Hi, good morning.
Erich Merkle
Hi, Keith.
Keith Naughton-Bloomberg
So, on the Lincoln side very strong on the SUVs with MKC and Navigator, not so much on the cars, you had a 299 lease deal going on MKZ for Black Friday and yet it fell 26.6% for the month, just wondering since it’s your second newest product if there is any cause for concern there?
John Felice
Well, thanks Keith. This is John. Overall we are really pleased with Lincoln’s results last month. As we mentioned the brand was up 21% in total, which was our best November since 2007. Year-to-date MKC as we have noted has performed very well. It’s up 6% on a year-to-date basis. So again we are working through new product launch in the showroom. There is always some cross shop between CD as well as small utilities. We are working through that, but again both products are doing very well in the showroom. And again overall Lincoln building on the sales momentum with the gains of last couple of months have been very encouraging.
Keith Naughton-Bloomberg
But John if I can just get you to speak to MKZ I know that SUVs are doing great but Z what’s going on there?
John Felice
I will just say as you know that Z sales were down a little bit last month and again we are working through where we are in terms of overall performance in the showroom and settling in with the cross shop between MKC as well as MKZ but year-to-date we are up 6% with Z and again both products are performing pretty well.
Keith Naughton-Bloomberg
Okay. Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Keith. Crystal next caller please.

Our next question will come from the line of Nick Bunkley from Automotive News. Please proceed.
Nick Bunkley-Automotive News
Hi, good morning. Between some of what you talked about with people going from cars to the small utilities and the utilities segment overall, and fuel prices and everything can you just talk a little bit about where you see your cars segment – your cars sales overall headed I mean is the numbers we are seeing this year were pretty much the number you are going to see in the years ahead. I mean the industry is slowing down as well you are on pace for about 750,000 car sales this year is that sort of what you are looking at going forward?
Erich Merkle
Well, Nick if you took a look for overall if you look at cars, cars have suffered throughout the year. And in fact if you look at this month, okay. For instance as an example you take a look at our small cars at retail they were pretty much on par even though the share of the overall industry for small cars was down 4 percentage points year-over-year. So at retail we have actually performed very where we have lost some sales in the cars segment has really been at the daily rental. So when you start taking a look at our 40,000 vehicle decline in daily rental this year that certainly has an impact on cars because cars are generally more sought after by daily rental companies and say Econolines or other vehicles that you might offer, so.
Nick Bunkley-Automotive News
Okay. Thank you.
Erich Merkle

Our next question will come from the line of Alisa Priddle from Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
Alisa Priddle-Detroit Free Press
Good morning everyone.
Erich Merkle
Hi Alisa.
Alisa Priddle-Detroit Free Press
Hi there, can you just talk - hi, there. Can you talk a little bit about incentive levels and in particular in the full-sized pickups segment?
Erich Merkle
Sure. Let me just get to that in a minute…
John Felice
Well, this is John. While Erich is getting the specifics on full-sized pickup maybe just some general comments on the industry incentive spend. We have seen pretty stable incentive spending when you look at it sequentially on a year-over-year basis the industry was up about $19, so relatively flat overall. And I think as we have talked about before the pricing environment in the industry itself has been very solid. On a year-over-year basis the industry pricing was up just under $900 with Ford we were up about $1300. So again a little bit difference between cars, utilities and trucks in the pricing environment. But generally relative discipline and incentive spend and solid transaction prices in the industry broadly and then maybe Erich could comment on truck.
Erich Merkle
Yes, sure. So Alisa if you take a look at trucks we look at just overall. You can on the incentive front for trucks for the segment, it was roughly I am going to say it was up sequentially – I am sorry my apologies it was down sequentially about $300, $350 and it was up versus a year ago about $350 to $400. So that’s kind of where the segment is at overall. As I mentioned earlier the ATPs are doing very well. So the average transaction prices for the segment are up a little over $2,000 year-over-year, so.
Alisa Priddle-Detroit Free Press
So do you have a sense then that the drop in F-Series sales for you guys so it’s not that the your competitors are taking advantage of your transition period is it something else going on, is it just your inventories how do you account [indiscernible] most important?
Erich Merkle
We manage our incentive spend. So if you take a look at F-Series our incentives spend declined approximately $300 compared to November of last year. Although segment was up we were actually down a little bit so we have managed it in line with the – in conjunction with how the segment is performing from an incentive perspective to manage those inventories as we work through our changeovers.
Alisa Priddle-Detroit Free Press
Okay, thank you.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Okay, thank you, Alisa. Next caller please.
