Steve Winoker
So, good morning. Thank you all for joining us with GE at Bernstein’s 32nd SDC. I’m Steve Winoker, Bernstein’s US multi-industry and electrical equipment analyst and we’re happy to welcome Keith Sherin, Chairman and CEO of GE Capital, with us for another repeat performance at this conference.
GE Capital is now roughly about $80 billion, $81 billion in ending net investment, about $285 billion of total assets, close to $29 billion or so of tangible common equity. They are running somewhere around 14 or so of Tier 1 common and about 11% tangible common equity – tangible assets following the recent run down or closer to 13% ex insurance. And this is really – potentially, it’s got to be the last year, I guess, we talk about GE capital as a totally separate entity with GE. They are collapsing the reporting and some other elements together.
GE management announced in April last year the multipronged plan to divest the remaining assets in GE Capital, excluding the vertical finance businesses, working capital solutions and the insurance runoff, all of which results in only about 10% of GE earnings coming from capital going forward compared to what was something like 57% back in 2007. This will result in under $80 billion of remaining ending net investment. And the stock is up about 20% since just before that announcement.
Keith joined GE in 1981 through the renowned financial management program on the industrial side, became an auditor, then had stints in engines and plastics before eventually being named CFO for all of GE in 1998. Keith was then appointed Chairman and CEO of GE Capital in 2013 and has executed this massive divestment and transformation process.
So with that, I’ll hand it off to Keith. And then afterwards, for Q&A, you probably don’t need a reminder, hopefully, at this point in the morning. But we have those anonymous index cards. Feel free to fill those out. And raise them up and we’ll have Renner [ph] take them up to me for Keith. So with that, Keith?
Keith Sherin
Steve, thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. And I thought I’d just do a couple of charts to give you an update on where we are in the GE Capital transformation, as Steve said, and I look forward to the dialogue in the Q&A. So I’m going to talk about all these pieces today in terms of the highlights. We’re about 80% complete on the asset sales. And I’ll give you a little more detail. We’re focused on closing the remaining businesses. We have about $35 billion to go in sales and we are actively working on marketing those. And then we filed our application to request rescission of the SIFI designation in the United States at the end of March and will ultimately be working on – working to exit our regulation for our international assets from the Prudential Regulatory Authority in the UK in 2017, so I’ll cover some more of that.
We’ve returned $32 billion of the capital to date out of the $55 billion target. And by the end of the year, we’ll be close to 80% done with the capital returns. And I’ll show you the details of that. We’re on track for the remaining $23 billion. The majority of that will be paid in 2016 and 2017.
We are working down excess debt. We have excess debt. As we sold these businesses, debt has not – it was long-term debt. It doesn’t mature in the timeframe of the Hubble Project and so we’re working on that. I’ll show you the details of that a little bit.
And the whole focus on GE Capital – now, we’ve really made a pivot to – our mission for our businesses – GECAS, energy and industrial finance – is to support GE’s industrial businesses and their customers. And so, our capital allocation and the projects that we are working on are all geared towards that instead of investing in things, financial assets, so we can make money in GE Capital separately. So that’s a huge pivot for us and a big theme change and I’ll show you some of that.
In terms of the Project Hubble and the progress, as I said, we’re about 80% done. We’ve signed $171 billion. We’ve got about $35 million to go. You can see on the right side. We’re on track to realize 1.1 times tangible book value for the pricing of the asset exits. And when we get that in the next two months, we should have that mostly done. We completed the debt exchange last year. We completed the split-off of Synchrony. We completed our corporate reorganization. We returned $32 billion so far between Synchrony and the dividends we have paid. And as I said, at the end of March, we applied for the SIFI de-designation. So a lot of progress on the plan and we feel pretty good about that.
But we still have some more to go. We’ve got $35 billion of assets to sell. The largest remaining asset, business that we are working on is our French consumer assets for the banking license in France. We are in negotiations to sell that. We also have a bank in Italy that we are in negotiations to sell that.
And then, the next largest thing would be our remaining franchise assets in the United States. We have about $3 billion and we are in negotiations to sell those. So if you look at the next couple of months, we’d expect to be – take more than half of that $35 billion and get that signed.
At the end of 2016, I think we’ll have roughly $10 billion of runoff. So we have the remaining senior secured loan program note from our partnership with Ares. That’s in runoff. That’s a good asset. And with our excess debt, we really don’t see a need to sell that one. We’re not marketing that right now. We’ll probably have the mortgages in Poland. We’ll still have those at the end of the year. And we may have a few other runoff assets by the end of the year.
So out of the $205 billion when we started in April 10 last year, we think we will end 2016 with somewhere around $10 billion of runoff assets as part of Project Hubble. The the rest will be signed and closed.
We do need to sell the international banks. We reached an agreement to sell Poland. That’s going to close hopefully by the end of the year. We IPO-ed our Czech bank a few weeks ago and that’s going extremely well. We still own roughly 48% and we’re going to hopefully get a secondary done by the end of the year. We have a six-month lock up on that. And then, obviously, we have $23 billion of capital to go. We paid $7.5 billion so far and I’ll show you the numbers on that. So quite a lot of progress and we see a path to get the to-go assets done.
Now, obviously, one of the big objectives of Project Hubble was to sell our non-GE-related assets, make GE Capital a lot smaller, a lot less interconnected, more resilient to financial shocks and certainly more simpler and resolvable. Those are the categories of evaluation that the Financial Stability Oversight Council used to determine that we were systemically important back in 2013.
We wrote our application to get de-designated. With that in mind, we looked at all the criteria. We’re trying to be very thorough. We’ve got a couple of hundred-page application we filed to talk about the changes we made inside of GE Capital when they think about our designation today. So we’re a lot smaller. Assets are down 50% when we filed. And even within that, a third of the assets that are remaining are in cash and liquidity. That’s up substantially from where it was when we were designated.
And we’re not just smaller. We exited whole pools of risk. So we’re no longer in the US consumer lending business. We’re no longer in the US midmarket lending and leasing. No longer in sponsored finance. We don’t have any more US depository institutions. We sold our federal savings bank and returned the charter. We also sold our industrial loan corporation. And so, we’re no longer a part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation safety net. And as Steve said, we’re going to be less than 10% of the company’s earnings as we go forward. So a much smaller entity.
We’re a lot less interconnected to the financial system. One of the biggest issues we had was our wholesale funding model. We termed out our CP. So we have around $5 billion of CP remaining today. We had over $40 billion at the time of designation. We’re not planning on issuing debt for the next four years, so we have excess debt, as we said. We’re a lot more resilient to financial shocks and our capital levels are significantly higher. And our cash and cash-like investments are up 35% and a third of our balance sheet.
And then, we are much more simpler and resolvable. We’ve created a holding company structure that holds the domestic assets and the holding company structure in the UK holds all our international assets. And we think we really are a much simpler enterprise when we look at ourselves.
So we filed at the end of March. We are working constructively with the FSOC to go through the de-designation process. There is no timetable for this. There is no real set process. We’re the first enterprise to do it. So all I can tell you is that we’ve given a very thorough application. That’s been acknowledged by the FSOC staff members. We are in a constructive dialogue with the FSOC around the process and we’re going to do this as expeditiously as possible.
We’d like to be considered for de-designation, obviously, as soon as we can. And they know that. They are working constructively on it. I wish I can give you more of it. It’s a constructive process. We’ve done a lot in the application. And we feel quite strong about that we’re no longer systemically important. But we have to go through this. And as soon as we know more from the FSOC and can communicate more, we will. But pretty constructive.
I put this chart together to just talk about regulatory governance at GE Capital. On the left column is the Federal Reserve. They are our consolidated supervisor today globally. On the right side is the Prudential Regulatory Authority. So even if we were de-designated and the Federal Reserve was no longer our consolidated supervisor, we would still be regulated for all of our international assets in the UK by the Prudential Regulatory Authority.
In the Federal Reserve case, the precedence for exit for us were, obviously, to no longer be a savings-and-loan hold company, which created oversight by the Federal Reserve. That was completed when we exited Synchrony. We’ve exited the US depository institutions, as I said, and the FDIC safety net. We’ve executed the GE Capital exit plan. We only have really $3 billion of assets in the US that we’re still marketing. The franchise assets are going to be done soon. And we filed for a rescission of the SIFI designation.
And on the right side, to look at the UK oversight of our global assets, when we put the Hubble plan together, we planned on selling the US assets first and we planned on being regulated internationally by our European regulator, who turned out to be the UK’s PRA, and so that was part of the strategy.
In the European Union, as long as we have licensed banks, we’re going to be subject to prudential oversight authority -- that is in the UK in the PRA today. We have seven more bank licenses that we will ultimately have to exit those banks and give those licenses back before we would be outside of the PRA’s regulatory oversight.
So we have a roadmap to exit. We’ve exited eight already. We have seven to go. We’ve reached an agreement to sell Poland. That hopefully will close by the end of the year. We have IPO-ed the Czech bank. That will close hopefully with a secondary by the end of the year when the lockup expires. We have to deal with the market conditions, obviously. We have an agreement in France and Germany for our factoring assets. That’s two licenses. And those should close in the third quarter. And then the remaining licenses are France, Italy and the UK bank. So we have a roadmap we relaying out to exit these assets. I think sometime in 2017, we’ll be able to finish the exit of those, give back those bank licenses and ultimately exit the PRA oversight.
And then, fundamentally, we would be regulated locally in our financial companies, the fincos that we have, which would be in the UK, France, Italy, and Germany. And we will be subject to the rating agency considerations in terms of capital and liquidity for the rating for GE Capital.
So what does it mean if we exited SIFI? It’s not like all the regulation goes away, obviously, because we will still be regulated by the PRA with our international assets. But, for us, the implications for an exit of SIFI, certainly, we will have increased flexibility in setting our capital levels, in line with the remaining risk in GE Capital. Today, we are operating under an agreement with the Federal Reserve on our Tier 1 common at 14%. We will reevaluate that once we’re no longer a SIFI and we’ll go to the GE board and talk about what our risks are and what we think the right capital level is. So that will be reevaluated.
But we’ll have reduced regulatory obligations, obviously, things like resolution planning, a lot of financial reporting that happens today under the Fed requirements will no longer be applicable to us. And we’ll eliminate the application of future Dodd-Frank requirements when the enhanced prudential standards for oversight were published by the Federal Reserve after we announced Project Hubble. We would be subject to CCAR and things like that in 2018 and those will go away as well if we get out of being a SIFI.
So I think it’s a very important milestone for us. We are working constructively on it. It is a significant event for us to not be a SIFI and that’s why it’s so important to us. And then, ultimately, we’ll have to work on getting the bank licenses back country by country and that will allow us to not be regulated by the PRA, but that will happen over a period of time into 2017. So, hopefully, that’s a little clarity on the regulatory situation for GE Capital.
In terms of the capital return, last year, we were at 45% between the Synchrony split and the dividends we paid. We are well ahead of the capital plan. Synchrony was really planned for 2016 and we only had $1 billion of dividends in April 10 plan.
In 2016, our plan is to return $18 billion of dividends. We’re on track for that. We paid $7.5 billion in the first quarter. We do need a SIFI de-designation to realize the total objectives we have here. But we feel confident about our ability to finish the remaining sales and close the assets. That’s the biggest driver here, is lowering our risk-weighted assets by closing on these asset sales. That frees up the capital and the excess capital we’re returning back to the parent.
We’ll be at $43 billion, roughly 80% of the plan by the end of this year. And then 2017 and 2018, there’s another $13 billion to go, the majority of that we think will happen in 2017 and that’s going to be a function of, again, not being a SIFI in 2016 and then not being regulated by the PRA and being able to take our capital levels down globally in 2017. So those are sort of the steps that we have. Finish the asset sales, not be regulated as a SIFI, and then ultimately not be regulated as a global legal entity in the UK.
So what’s left in GE Capital are the verticals. You know these three businesses. GECAS is the biggest portion of the remaining GE Capital. It’s about $40 billion of that $80 billion investment that Steve referenced. Energy finance is a little over $10 billion of investment and a net investment in the $40 billion and then industrial finance is about $20 billion, little over $20 billion investment, and the remainder is in the runoff insurance. So we’ll be about $80 billion of investment. We’re going to earn $1.6 billion roughly this year. That’s a target for our net income for the verticals. And we’ve got a 13% return on tangible equity ex the insurance business.
As I said, the main focus for the remainder of GE Capital employees is really to support the industrial businesses and their customers. And that’s a mindset change. That’s something we talk about at every meeting. That’s something that the underwriting and origination is all focused on. And GECAS has already always been very focused, obviously, on the relationship with GE Aviation. 85% of the fleet is GE or CFM engines. That’s very strong.
Energy has had – half of what they did was related to the GE industrial businesses and half was not. That’s significantly shifted to be more focused on the industrial businesses.
And then Trevor Schauenberg is growing the industrial finance business. The factoring business is very focused on GE, obviously, but the industrial finance for the other parts of the company – industrial company are really growing now with Trevor and we are really just building pipelines and I’ll show you that.
So we talk about being a valuable part of the GE store. Inside of GE Capital today, that’s our mission. You know the capabilities, obviously, for aviation, energy and healthcare. We are very supportive of equipment pull-through, big campaigns in energy or aviation. We, obviously, support and we do a lot of factoring for the company. But what we’re adding his new capabilities and mainly it’s across the other industrial businesses. So we’ve got a origination-dedicated sales team, a focus on distributive power, transportation, energy connections and lighting. We’re doing a lot with current on LED.
We’re trying to help our industrial businesses customers with their need to convert CapEx spending to OpEx and provide them with financing solutions that enable them to put the cost of an upgrade for their energy infrastructure into the run rate as opposed to having to spend the CapEx up front. And the whole sales team is focused on that inside of GE Capital and now partnered with these industrial businesses.
So we’re doing a lot more with global markets. We’re doing a lot more with vendor relationships. For example, we sold our midmarket leasing and lending business to Wells Fargo. They’ve got, obviously, a huge deposit base that they want to use. They love being a partner with us on industrial financing, for not only GE, but also for GE’s customers. And so, we’re going to do a lot more relationships like that. So our whole focus now is helping GE industrial grow and creating shareholder value by using our capital to support the industrial businesses
Here’s the earnings outlook for GE Capital. We’ve been giving sort of the total net income forecast for GE Capital, just to try and make it easier. With all the moving parts, it’s been tough to forecast. So our verticals estimate for this year is $1.6 billion. As we said, we have $3 billion of losses in other continuing. The largest piece of that is our excess debt cost. We will end the year with roughly $40 billion of excess debt. So we sold the businesses and the debt has not matured. So we have $40 billion of excess debt and $40 billion of excess cash in the bank earning nothing and then we’re paying the interest on the debt. The after-tax cost of the debt is the biggest piece of that.
That excess debt will decline over the next couple of years by – in 2016, as I said, we’ll be roughly $40 billion. We’ll go down to roughly $20 billion in 2017, about $10 billion in 2018 and it goes away in 2019. And the excess interest costs associated with that excess debt will follow the same pattern and are down to zero by the end of 2019.
So to be able to basically dismantle GE Capital and take it to a place where we’ve got $80 billion of ending net investment and to get the excess interest costs out of here in that timeframe has been really – it’s a great profile overall. Dan Janki and the treasury team have done a lot with ALM management and we’ve taken and we’ve repurchased all of the debt we can in economic terms and now we’re basically just trying to figure out are there other things that we can do with this debt. There are some small areas where maybe we’ll be able to do more asset liability management. But we’re going to have excess debt cost as we look forward into 2019.
And then you look at capital, continuing overall, we’re going to lose a little over $1 billion this year. We had in April 10 – we forecast to lose around $1 billion. We think we will make between zero and $0.5 billion in 2017 and we had a forecast for breakeven roughly. And then in 2018, a little under billion dollars is what we forecast in April 10 and we’re somewhere between $0.5 billion and $1 billion on a consolidated basis. So in 2019, the excess carry costs go away and basically in 2020 going forward you have GE Capital verticals without the excess debt cost and without the other peripheral noise.
So I think the verticals are going to earn in line with size. As you look at the $1.6 billion going to $1.4 billion, a big piece of that is we’re going to take GECAS down in size. Today, as I said, they are about $40 billion of ending net investment. We think they’ll be roughly around $34 billion, $35 billion of ending net investments in 2018 and that’s the biggest change going on inside the financial forecast, is that GE Capital will take GECAS down a little bit. There will be less gains and we’ll grow Trevor’s business, the industrial finance, a little bit to offset it, to keep around the $80 billion of ENI. So vertical earnings will be in line with the size of overall GE Capital and the whole focus is on supporting the industrial businesses.
So with that, this has been an incredible exercise inside the company. The team has done a terrific job of transforming the portfolio. We’ve executed the plan and have focused the company back on the digital industrial, something that we’re all supportive of. We are returning $55 billion of capital back to the shareholders, basically taking the investment in GE Capital and giving it back to GE. The buyback offsets the lost earnings. And you end up with a company – an industrial company in 2018 that’s over 90% industrial earnings and we’re going to be somewhere around 6% or 7% or so of the earnings of the company by that point. And we’re going to be totally focused on supporting the industrial company. And I think it’s just a much better place to be, having us really working as part of the GE store and not be in a financial enterprise on our own inside the GE industrial parent.
So we feel pretty good about the progress. We know we have more work to do. But we have line of sight to sort of the actions. And with that, we’ll go back to the Q&A, Steve.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Steve Winoker
That’s great. Keith, thanks so much. Thanks again for coming to SDC this year with everything you have going on, divesting hundreds of billions of dollars of assets and now you’re telling us that – I guess, my most obvious question, by our count and by your count, you had $171 billion out of that $206 billion goal, $35 billion left at least in terms of signing deals, $50 billion to close. This alone takes the GE share count – my last calculation was from maybe $10.1 billion originally to about $8.4 billion, $8.5 billion. Is that still the thinking probably?
Keith Sherin
Yeah, that hasn’t changed. Yes.
Steve Winoker
Okay. And you may not look…
Keith Sherin
Obviously, it depends on the GE share price, Steve.
Steve Winoker
Okay, it does. But, obviously, that’s risen since originally you gave the first guidance.
Keith Sherin
Yeah.
Steve Winoker
But is that…?
Keith Sherin
That’s the forecast we have today. I don’t know the exact share number. But we haven’t changed that basically. Our capital returns back to the parent are all earmarked for buyback.
Steve Winoker
Okay, great.
Keith Sherin
No question about it. And as I say, Keith, you may not look it, but you’ve been at the company for 35 years, right? And so, can you help portfolio managers in the audience from a kind of long-term context put the current transformation over just the last year and a half into context for an investment perspective as they think about the business going forward?
Keith Sherin
Yeah. I think the last year and a half has been dramatic. But really it’s been many years of portfolio change, right? If you look at what the portfolio is today versus take it when Jeff started, all of the insurance businesses are gone. That was a huge change in the portfolio. All of the materials businesses are now out of the portfolio – the plastics, the specialty materials, the silicones. The media, NBC, I think that’s a much more streamlined industrial portfolio today without media. And now, financial services. To take financial services from its own separate financial set of objectives – and as you said, it was over 50% of the earnings at one time and to really just risk-reduce and transform the GE portfolio to be focused on the industrials. That all have leverage from the GE store, whether it’s R&D or it’s globalization or it’s services, and digitization that is going on today inside the portfolio.
We feel great about the transformation. We feel like this GE Capital plan just makes the company so much simpler. One, for investors. I think it’s been too complicated for investors. And two, to run. I think for GE leadership going forward, it’s just a simpler portfolio with a lot more common processes and a lot more common customers and a lot more common shared services inside the company from, as I said, the R&D, the services, and the globalization. It’s a cleaner, more synergistic portfolio. So we feel great about it. And to be able to actually execute this and the timeframe we did is something that we’re all – GE Capital people have done -- I’m so proud of the work they did. They are sad about not being a part of GE. They really like working for the company, but they are proud of what they have done to make GE a better company going forward. And that’s something they all feel really great about.
Steve Winoker
In that line, one of the audience questions around this entire process is, what’s been the biggest disappointment first and maybe positive surprise? Second, with regard to this entire de-risk and leveraging?
Keith Sherin
I get this question quite a bit about, what was the hardest thing or most disappointing thing. It’s not – there hasn’t been a disappointment about how we executed Hubble. In the end, we had a good plan and we got lucky. We use a lot of our backup plans. But if we had started six months later, would we have been able to sell leverage finance at the price we got or even sell it at all. So we had good timing. And as I said, we had a lot of contingency plans and we used a lot of them. Hubble itself has gone quite well, I would say. The hard thing, as I said, is that there is a massive displacement. At the peak, we had 47,000 employees in GE Capital when we started this. Today, we’re down about 15,000. The majority of those employees have gone with successor employers. That’s been great. Almost 90% of the people have gone to successor employers, which has been terrific. People have a lot of pride about GE Capital. It’s a long time, successful part of the company, and so the disappointing thing is that people are leaving. The people are leaving GE Capital and they are going on to other careers. What I tell them is, if you were here celebrating the good old days of GE Capital, you’re in the wrong place. We are dealing with the reality of GE Capital today. We’re not as competitive. We’re not competitive. We’re not competitive when you compare to banks or deposit funds. If you look at our capital levels, at sort of 8 to 1 leverage, we are under 3 to 1 leverage. You look at liquidity, we used to fund ourselves with CP and now we’re all termed out long-term debt and equity. There is no good old days we’re going to come back to. So we’re dealing with the reality. You can feel great about what GE Capital was. The world changed. We’ve dealt with that strategically and you ought to move forward and build on your GE heritage. So that’s a disappointing thing, I think is that people just feel sad about leaving GE.
In terms of surprises, I just think the way everyone rallied around this as an objective, people really loved being a part of Project Hubble, Steve, and they love working on it and they work incredibly hard to get it done. And they feel great about. As I said, changing the strategic footprint of GE for the better for the next 15 or 20 years. That’s something they feel great about. And the fact that everyone engaged in it – even though they are working themselves out of a job, they engaged in it in a way that was remarkable and worked incredibly hard to get it done. That’s what I feel really great about.
Steve Winoker
It’s impressive when you know they are headed in that direction.
Keith Sherin
Yeah.
Steve Winoker
So another set of questions around de-designation. What is the back-and-forth dialogue with the FSOC on that, on the de-designation process? How does that really work? When you say we’re making progress and it’s meaningful, what does that look like?
Keith Sherin
I wish I could share that with you. We’ve been asked not to. We’re the first one to go through the process. So we filed an application that we think was incredibly thorough. We think it met all of the different analysis criteria that the FSOC was going to have to review and deal with. I have gone and met with the FSOC staff after the filing with Alex Dimitrief, our legal counsel. We went down to Washington and met with the entire FSOC staff after our filing. And subsequent to that, we ended up in a dialogue around follow-up and things like that. But we just don’t have a timeframe. It’s something that we consistently have said and it’s uncertain for investors in some ways and we feel bad about that. But that’s something the FSOC has basically said they don’t have a process. They have never done this before. They are working constructively with us. We’ve given them the information we think that we need to help them to make that decision. There is nothing left to sell in the US. There is $3 billion of franchise assets left to sell in the US. So it’s not like I can say, well, wait until we have finished selling the franchise assets. I think they understand that we are substantively done. We have basically less than $50 billion of financing assets in the US ex insurance and ex the cash. And so, we think we have met the criteria that we would expect to not be a SIFI. But, again, we have to go through this with them. There are 10 different agencies that are formal voting members of the FSOC and five observing agencies. And we’ve got to respect their process and let them work through their process with their teams and we’re doing that. And if we can provide any information, we are constructively giving them any additional information. But I think constructive, professional and substantive in terms of their review and discussion with us.
Steve Winoker
Clearly, there is a high sense of urgency on the part of GE here.
Keith Sherin
Yeah.
Steve Winoker
Is there significant resource dedication on behalf of the agencies that you can tell?
Keith Sherin
I would say that the people who are part of the FSOC who are involved in our designation and who are involved in the process for this rescission application are working on, I really don’t have a day-to-day knowledge of – I know there are people that are dedicated to it and we have a dialogue. But I just don’t know how many people are working on it directly and some of the sub agencies. The FSOC is headquartered out of treasury and Jack Lew is the chair of it. And so there is a dedicated staff there. Those are the people we’re dealing with the most, but we are responding to any inquiry from the other agencies that come up.
Steve Winoker
Okay. On the PRA side, they mentioned in 2017. Let’s assume that you are fully de-designated by the FSOC this year, but you have, as you mentioned, the whole series of actions to go through for the PRA. In between those, is there a capital – is there an impact on your ability to, again, sort of shrink your capital and send it up to the parent or…?
Keith Sherin
Well, there is a process. I think the plan that we laid out and what I just communicated in terms of the dividends flowing back to the parent assume that that process is in place and we have to execute on it. So as I said, to deliver $18 billion of dividends in 2016, we assume that we’re going to get de-designated by the FSOC and that will allow us to reevaluate our capital levels and we’ll have to go through all that. But that’s in there. In 2017 – in 2016, we filed an ICAP. It’s a very thorough capital plan with the PRA. We’ve filed an ILAP which is a thorough liquidity plan. They are doing the review of those plans, just like in the US there is a CCAR process. So there are very similar processes with the PRA. We would expect that we would constructively be able to reach some form of agreement on capital planning with the PRA. They’ve been incredibly constructive. And again, they see that we are selling all the assets as well. And so, we’ll go through a capital plan. In terms of liquidity, we have so much excess liquidity in the international holding company that that really shouldn’t be any issue. And so, we’ll go through our capital plan with them and I think, for us, either some form of agreement on the capital planning or, eventually in 2017, giving back all those bank licenses and not being regulated by the PRA, either of those two things will lead to the dividend plan that we’ve laid out. Either of those two things. So we’ve got two paths in 2017 basically to deliver what we said for investors.
Steve Winoker
Coming back to the amount of businesses that you’ve sold and the price points that you’ve sold them for, still seems like you’re headed to a number in excess of the original target, unless the remaining assets really are more challenged and the environment is more challenged. How are you sort of thinking about the contingency versus task that’s embedded in what you have left to do that would keep you at that same target level?
Keith Sherin
I would say that the remaining assets outside the US that we’re selling will be at discounts to tangible book value that will lead us to be right around 1.1 times tangible book value in total. As you know, we’re above 1.1 today. But we’re close on Italy, we’re close on France, we have an idea where these are going to come out and they will bring us close to the 1.1 in total.
Steve Winoker
Okay.
Keith Sherin
They’ll be discounts to tangible book value on those two sales. If they are the last two things you’re selling, they probably weren’t the most attractive assets in the auction process to begin with.
Steve Winoker
Okay, that’s fair. And in terms of maybe looking also at all the write-downs that we’re taking up to this point, given your visibility through the rest of this process and the sale prices you described, there is no expectation for anything additional. You feel like you have covered that early on.
Keith Sherin
I think we are like $22.5 billion out of the $23 billion, so there could be another $0.5 billion. We are in line with the $23 billion overall for Hubble cumulatively. So I think there’s a $0.5 billion.
Steve Winoker
But nothing additional?
Keith Sherin
No. Inside the $23 billion.
Steve Winoker
Okay. Moving on for a second to the financing businesses for a second, what does the customer financing around the industrial businesses tell you about strength of GE’s businesses and maybe the economy overall? So when you sort of think about how you’re fitting into supporting the industrial side.
Keith Sherin
A little early to say, right? GCAS isn’t really financing day to day stuff that’s going on in aviation. It’s such a long-cycle business. I’d say the market is quite strong. Obviously, the airlines are – the profitability in airlines is substantial. They are doing much better than they have the last many years. And fuel is a big part of that consolidation, it’s a big part of that – revenue passenger miles are up, I think, close to 5%. So the airline business is in quite strong shape. And GCAS isn’t really a short-term indicator of much, I think. We are placed our skyline through 2017. So that’s an indication that the demand is pretty good. I would say that’s pretty standard and normal, but the airline businesses in a pretty good cycle right now.
And energy, I think much tougher. The renewable side is very strong and there is quite a big discussion about things like repowering the US. The production tax credits have been extended for four years. There is a big opportunity if you can put larger, more efficient turbines in and we are evaluating whether that’s going to work. That’s something that the energy business focuses on. The solar business has had quite a bit of activity in the renewable space. But the oil and gas base has been very tough. We exited, as you know, all the oil and gas investments in just reserves. We don’t do that anymore. So, again, it’s part of the pivot to be connected to the industrial business unless we’re going to put capital to work that supports the industrial business in some way. It doesn’t have to be direct product sales, but it’s got to be something the industrial customers say. Industrial businesses are the customers who say this is going to help GE hopefully directly, somewhat indirectly. We won’t be doing it. So oil and gas has been very tough. And we had the impairments over the last 12 months. I think those have abated. Now, with oil back to $50, that pressure has definitely receded. But there is not a lot of new capital going in. It’s still very challenging, I’d say. And then industrial finance, what Trevor has, there’s really – we’re just building a pipeline. The biggest thing that he’s got going is in LED. There is a lot of discussion about whether you’re a retail client or a large bank, like JP Morgan did a big deal to put LEDs in all their facilities. Municipalities redoing all the street lights with LEDs or the large retailers doing their older stores. Those are the types of projects with big backlog and it’s really around energy efficiency as opposed to, boy, this is a real GDP indicator. So I think it’s too early to tell for us on some of those other things in GE Capital, whether we’re a real indicator of industrial strength or GDP. I don’t have any new messages on GDP than what Jeff really shared at EPG, I’d say.
Steve Winoker
When you think about the financing that you’re providing to industrial customers, is there an appetite? Is the customer base, whether it’s in power gen or oil and gas or in renewables, is there a difficulty for those guys to tack their own financing without GE financing?
Keith Sherin
It really varies by project and by customer. In the energy space, obviously, a lot of the larger customers have their own capital. They really don’t use GE financing when they are putting together a big power plant deal. We’re not a big part of that. In the renewable space, we’re a big part of it. We provide the tax equity in a lot of projects. That’s a big competitive differentiator for us and we have the tax base to do it. We’re not really in the place as a captive yet to be able to say this is really an indicator for how the GE industrial business is growing. But I can tell you that from Jeff Bornstein’s perspective, what we’re trying to do with the focus of GE Capital, we really want to get to the point where we are able to articulate our contribution to incremental industrial revenue. And that’s what we’re working on inside the company as we go through our strategy session. Last year was all about Hubble. This year is half Hubble, half vertical. And as we focus on the vertical, how can we really articulate the contribution we’re making to the industrial businesses that we show that the use of this capital is really good incrementally for the industrial business, as an overall for GE shareholders. So that’s something we’re working on.
Steve Winoker
Part of my question, where you’re, let’s just say, head to head on the – if the healthcare business is head-to-head with Siemens or somebody else going into a bid, does it incrementally help them…?
Keith Sherin
I think it always helps to have financing. It’s clear it’s a differentiator certainly globally. Healthcare, we’ve already been doing that for quite a long time, so that’s not a big change for us. I think we’re going to try and do more globally. We are very strong in the US for the healthcare business. And in Western Europe, we’ve been okay, but we can do more globally for healthcare. That’s the kind of thing that Trevor is trying to build out. How can I do more globally for something like healthcare? But that’s exactly what we want to be able to articulate as we go forward.
Keith Sherin
I do have more vertical questions, but I don’t want to lose this. The $1.4 billion expected loss on the earnings slide versus the $1 billion prior expectation, what’s the incremental 400-ish-million?
Keith Sherin
I think the main thing would probably be the – in that $3 billion loss includes our cost of the preferred where we had to reissue all the preferred and the incremental costs are in there on that. That would probably be the biggest piece.
The excess debt is a little higher. We sold the businesses sooner than we thought, so the excess debt carry cost is a little higher as well. But, basically, we had a lot of these businesses through 2016 and into 2017 in the plan. And, now, by selling them earlier that the excess debt cost is a little higher. We lose the net income, obviously, and we still have the carry costs.
Steve Winoker
Overall, it’s a good problem to have if the priority…
Keith Sherin
I think it’s a better – we made that trade-off every time. You could wait a little longer, but you just have too much strategic risk if we did that. We just said let’s get this done and then we will deal with the excess debt cost.
Steve Winoker
And given that that’s a little bit new today, or just my understanding, it doesn’t change the overall framework for the GE 2016…?
Keith Sherin
No. They are using the verticals in their 2016 framework, obviously.
Steve Winoker
As opposed to the discontinued?
Keith Sherin
Yeah, yeah.
Steve Winoker
Okay, fine. Question from the audience, does it make sense to eventually move aircraft leasing out of GE Capital, what are the impediments to doing so?
Keith Sherin
First of all, I would say that while we are in a situation where we have so much excess debt, I’m not sure that that’s a really good decision. I think having assets that are – GECAS has a great return on equity. It’s in the mid-teens. It’s got a great, strong industrial strategic relationship with our industrial parent and it’s got a very strong market position with good earnings and risk management through the cycle. It’s a great performance by a very strong, experienced team, highly regarded by customers.
In the world of never say never, when you’re out of excess debt, would there be a way to have some other capital structure for GECAS? Maybe. Again, I wouldn’t – never say never. But while we have excess debt, I just don’t see it as a – it’s not a priority inside the company. It’s a very well run, strong financial returning, great partnership with the industrial business today. In the never say never category, who knows. But, right now, for the next couple of years, this is the plan we’ve got with the board and how we’re planning to run GECAS.
Steve Winoker
Any appetite for going in the exact opposite direction and actually building it up further – and looking for – you guys are q…
Keith Sherin
I would say no.
Steve Winoker
Okay. Fair enough.
Keith Sherin
No, you will not see us – there is no situation that we can envision where will be using incremental capital to grow GE Capital versus returning the capital back to the parent. I just don’t see it.
Steve Winoker
Okay. And maybe talk a little bit about what’s going on in the aircraft leasing market today that you are seeing within that business, how we think about that impacting aircraft residual values…?
Keith Sherin
It’s very competitive. There’s a couple of big players, obviously, with us, AerCap, and we’ve got a lot of additional new competitors out of Asia. There is a ton of leasing companies out of China, backed by Chinese banks or other Chinese sources of capital. The aircraft leasing space is very competitive. But we have a few advantages in terms of our total lifecycle management and our ability to globally re-market our servicing capability, our spare engine leasing business, our ability to take a plane back and re-part it out with our re-parting operation in the US.
So I think we feel very strong about our competitive position. We’re not chasing deals. The difference in GE Capital today about – always having earnings growth targets versus having a set of capital that you want to optimize the use of is pretty substantial. GECAS does not have – today, Alec Burger with me, he doesn’t have – you go to take this from $1.2 billion this year to $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in the plan. Now go figure how to do it. Today, it’s got – you got this much capital, I want you to optimize that and I want you to do it in a way that supports the industrial businesses and I want you to earn a good return on that capital. And that’s a different profile. We’re going to take GECAS down over the next couple of years actually, about $39 billion of investment today, down to around $35 million, $34 billion by 2018. That’s a different way to run the place. And so, I think we’ll be able to be opportunistic in the cycle, Steve, instead of – we’re going to participate in whatever the cycle is in the context of not going above the $80 billion of investment overall. We’ll reallocate capital between Trevor’s business, between GECAS, between energy as opposed to ‘we’re going to keep growing forever.’ I think it’s a big difference in terms of how we’re going to operate the place financially.
Steve Winoker
That’s interesting. You’re looking at an existing pool of capital that you’re going to optimize across all the industrial – all the businesses that support the industrial business. But there are places like GECAS which have been incredibly strategic back and forth with the engine business. And to what extent are they – as you shrink that business that that actually becomes a challenge for the aircraft business?
Keith Sherin
We have a very strong dialogue with David Joyce and his team about that. The difference between being $40 billion of assets or to $35 billion of assets and making that contribution to what we need with aviation, there is not a big difference at that size. We’re going to be one of the – where the largest today will be one or two with AerCap. We don’t see a strategic impediment to being able to do what we need to do with GECAS to help aviation, even being a little smaller inside of GE Capital.
But we have that dialogue with David and Jeff. Plus, look at the cycle they are in, right, they are in the new generation of narrow body technology. We have lightened up on our last-of-line orders on the 737s and the A320s. We have orders in for the NEOs and the MAX. And we’re not heavy in the wide-body cycle other than the 777 where we got the exclusive position with Boeing. So in terms of the cycle of where we are, GECAS, naturally, by not being heavier in the end-of-line on the narrow bodies is going to be – that’s part of the shrinkage over the next couple of years. Is just a strategic decision we made around risk management while the technology is changing in the industry so heavily?
That’s a piece of it.
Steve Winoker
That’s fair enough. Also, you mentioned distributor power, transportation, energy connections, lighting, they’re all of these other areas now that you want to share that capital with. How far through that vision are you guys – it’s still pretty early?
Keith Sherin
Yeah, it’s early. Trevor has got his origination team. People who did not go with the sales who were part of his direct sales force, he’s got quite a few of those people, they are now aligned with those industrial businesses and we’re working on how do we maximize what we do. It’s a different game. It’s not a project equity game. It’s going to be alone, a support to financing with effective interest rate sales process with the customers as opposed to, boy, there is a big project financing, very capital intensive, long cycle. This is going to be stuff that we can use capital markets to fund that we’ll be able to do as much as we need on our balance sheet and it’s really to enable the sales in a flow sort of business for the most part.
Steve Winoker
All right. Well, Keith, we’ve come from having you here with all of this as a potential idea to being announced, to it now being executed, almost finished, but not quite there yet. So are there any comments you’d like to make to wrap up and I think it’s amazing for us to sort of see this come full circle.
Keith Sherin
I’m happy we are here talking about it, being substantially more than half way through. And for us, GE Capital is going to remain an important part of the company. It’s going to be supporting our industrial business and their customers. We’ve got a great team. Our energy, our aviation, and our healthcare financing or factoring, these are really very strong enterprise capabilities for the GE store. And we’re going to finish Project Hubble and return the capital and basically complete the transformation of the industrial portfolio back to focus on a strong set of very cohesive industrial companies that have a lot of synergy with the GE store. And I think it’s really great for investors. So we’re focused on finishing Hubble and we’re focused on bringing these verticals in a way that really it’s a good capital allocation for the investor around the GE store.
Steve Winoker
Great. All right. Thanks very much. Thanks for joining us.
Keith Sherin
Good to be here, Steve. Thank you.
