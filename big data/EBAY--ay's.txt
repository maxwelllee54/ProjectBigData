Mark May - Citi
I'm Mark May. I'm the Internet analyst at Citi. It's my pleasure to host the eBay today at our conference. One of the things that eBay does that we really appreciate is giving us access to great executives that are in the trenches running the business day to-day and so appreciate Tracey and the team in Investor Relations for giving us access to Devin Wenig, who runs the eBay Global Marketplaces for eBay. So appreciate you doing this.
Devin Wenig
Pleasure to be here. Thank you.
Mark May - Citi
Thanks. So I think that some of us in the audience that maybe have not had a chance to meet you before. So maybe if you wouldn't mind just starting us off, little bit background about yourself, what your role is, and kind of what are your key priorities that you are working on right now?
Devin Wenig
Sure. I have been at eBay for three years. I run Marketplaces. Marketplaces is basically the eBay part of eBay. It's all the eCommerce businesses, eBay StubHub, eBay Classifieds, in essence there is eCommerce and payments and I run that eCommerce part of eBay. Before that I was Chief Executive of the Financial and Media businesses of Thomson Reuters. So it's been an interesting three years in Silicon Valley.
I tried to do a couple of things; I put a priority on growing the user base. I put a priority on globalizing the business. And I put a priority on trying to really quickly evolve the product line so that the eBay that's in people's mind of this auction and used goods consumer sold business is really not the reality of our business any more. It is largely an end-to-end eCommerce business, new goods over 70%, highly engaged and much more approachable user experience. And really that's in the march over the last three years.
Mark May - Citi
If you were to use the baseball analogy, where do you think you are innings wise in terms of changing user perception around what eBay Marketplaces stands for?
Devin Wenig
I think in eCommerce here, you are in is you're perennially  everybody is perennially stuck in the first innings because that's such a rapidly evolving industry. But, I think if you look at the acceleration in our user base, I think we have made a fair bit of progress. I do think there is still a consumer perception gap. I think that the eBay that's perceived is different than the eBay that is. And we are going to take some steps beginning this fall to try to close that gap down by stepping up our brand efforts. So that will start this fall.
I hadnt wanted to do that until I was confident that the product and customer experience was ready. I don't like going out and screaming about your business if it's not ready for prime time. I now think the product and business is ready to begin to close the perception gap.
Mark May - Citi
Okay.
Devin Wenig
I want people to come to eBay because I think they will be surprised positively by what they see. So we will start some of that effort this fall.
Mark May - Citi
In the last quarter, there was talk about stepping up marketing spend in the context there was more around I think reengaging users after what happened earlier in the year, is it  talk to us a little bit more about what you are doing there specifically, how are you going about trying to reengage people? And maybe is that different from the branding that you just talked about?
Devin Wenig
It's different. When we have the data breach for those who don't know, we required 150 million customers to reset their passwords, which is not a simple thing for an eCommerce company to do. But, to keep our flywheel turning, we engaged in a lot of tactical marketing, couponing, promotions, things like that. And we continue to grow through that period. It obviously created a divot, and we are still seeing a bit of a headwind from that data issue.
