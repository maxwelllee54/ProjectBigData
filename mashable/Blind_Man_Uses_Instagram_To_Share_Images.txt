Blind Man Uses Instagram To Share Images

Tommy Edison is blind but still enjoys using the photo editing and sharing app, Instagram. 
"It's kinda fun for me, I've never had a camera before," he says in a YouTube video. 
In the video, Edison explains how he uses Instagram to capture, edit, caption and share images he takes with Instagram. Even though he can't see the images, Edison says he's received some interesting comments on the ones he's posted.

Using the "accessibility" feature on his iPhone, Edison can make it so Siri reads aloud everything he touches â€” from apps to filters to sharing things on social networks. This makes iPhones accessible for visually impaired individuals. He captions the images by using speech recognition.

There are a number of other apps for blind people. One handy app can identify what denomination of currency you're holding, to prevent being ripped-off. Another app uses Foursquare data to help visually impaired people navigate the streets.
