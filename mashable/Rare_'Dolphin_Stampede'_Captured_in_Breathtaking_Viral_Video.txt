Rare 'Dolphin Stampede' Captured in Breathtaking Viral Video

In a rare display, 1,000 common dolphins stampeded off the coast of California, captivating onlookers on a whale-watching boat. 
Footage of the stampede, captured by tour company Dolphin Safari, has attracted nearly 200,000 views since going online Sunday. 
It features the dolphin pod swimming near a boat of whale-watchers who ooh and ahh at the breathtaking sight. 
"The line of dolphins could be seen miles away churning up the water," Dolphin Safari wrote on the video's YouTube page. "The dolphins turned and stampeded directly over to the boat. Often this unusual behavior happens without warning or anything frightening them as was the case this time."
Dana Point, Calif., where the footage was taken, has the greatest density of oceanic dolphins per square mile "of anywhere in the world," according to Dolphin Safari.
