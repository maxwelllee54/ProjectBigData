Easily the Grossest Thing You'll See Today

Once upon a time, a man named Brent Askwith killed a really big spider with bug spray. Then a gigantic worm crawled out of the spider's belly. And kept crawling out. And crawled out more. It just kept coming and coming. And it was so slimy, too. At first it looked like some disgusting perversion on the good ol' curly fry. Then it unfurled itself and started squirming around on the floor. 
The whole situation was probably the grossest thing to ever happen after someone killed a spider. Luckily, it's on YouTube and we can all be grossed out together.
