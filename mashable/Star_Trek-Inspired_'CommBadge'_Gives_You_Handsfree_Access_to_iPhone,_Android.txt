Star Trek-Inspired 'CommBadge' Gives You Handsfree Access to iPhone, Android

The "combadge," a two-in-one device that's both a communicator and badge worn by Starfleet, has arrived three centuries early.
While it's not an exact replica of Star Trek's iconic gadget, the CommBadge functions in a similar way. The Bluetooth speakerphone, which works with iPhone and Android, helps users access their smartphone hands-free. Measuring 1.5 inches in diameters, the circular speaker can be clipped onto clothing, or left in a bag.
Why not just wear a Bluetooth headset? Commbadge's creators say it is designed so that "clean sound waves reach the user, but the sound waves that travel beyond a foot or so from the users ears are scrambled." In other words, it's a way to avoid looking "Bluetooth crazy."
The Commbadge also uses a "noise-canceling chipset" to minimize background noise, according to its Indiegogo page.
It can help users place and answer calls, send and receive text messages, as well as access Siri, Google Now and other intelligent personal assistants, among other tasks. Check out the video, above, for more.
