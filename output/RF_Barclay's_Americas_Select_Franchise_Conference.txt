Next up, very pleased to have Regions Financial. Regions is a company that, over the last several years, has made considerable progress, improving its balance sheet, managed franchise, which is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the United States, and now back to the point where it's improved its capital position so much, that it's now increasing its dividend and buying back stock earlier this year. And a lot of these improvements came from naming Grayson Hall, it's Chief -- CEO; and David Turner, it's CFO, both are here with us this morning. Also present is List Underwood and Dana Nolan from Investor Relations.
With that, let me turn it over to Grayson.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, Jason, and good morning. As Jason mentioned, we do have a number of our representatives here with us today, and we'll be glad to answer questions at the end of this presentation.
So we would like to review Regions' value proposition, to put it more simply, and why we believe Regions continues to have a good investment thesis. We firmly believe, although our stock outperformed in 2012, that Regions still has a significant opportunity ahead for growth and value creation. For those of you who are not familiar with our company, I will touch briefly on who we are and review our strong market presence, primarily in the Southeastern United States, which gives us a key competitive advantage.
I'll then cover our progress in several important fronts over the last 2 years, which has made Regions a much stronger company today and positions us well for the future. Importantly, it also demonstrates a proven ability to execute our business plans. And then, I'll speak in areas we still see opportunities for outperformance, including our current business plans to support growth in both households and loans.
Regions is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama and it is among the largest U.S. banks with $120 billion in assets. We operate in 16 of 50 states, have -- or 85% of our deposits are located in 7 core Southeastern states. We have #1 deposit market share in Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi, and we ranked fourth or better in Florida, Louisiana and Arkansas. In addition, we have a major market presence in both St. Louis and Indianapolis.
Our footprint gives us a couple of very unique advantages. The top 10 markets in which we operate are characterized by either higher market share, higher growth or both. This is an important source of future growth and enhanced profitability for our franchise.
Additionally, Regions is well positioned competitively in our core Southeastern U.S. markets. In our core markets, we have the third largest weighted average market share currently at 9.4%. In short, with a strong market presence and a competitive product set, we have a great platform in which to build. In addition, as a result of our actions over the past few years, we have significantly improved our financial position. The management team has worked diligently to navigate through a challenging economic environment, as well as to strengthen and position the company for future opportunities.
This particular slide sort of illustrates that point and illustrates the specific progress we have made and as measured by 7 key metrics. Starting with our deposit and funding costs, you can see the progress that we've made over a 2-year period, driven by a favorable mix of our deposits.
At the same time, mortgage revenues have increased, certainly supported by historically low interest rates. Additionally, we have experienced modest net interest margin expansion, driven largely by our deposit repricing efforts. And as a result of our continued focus on expense management and strategic initiatives, our efficiency ratio has improved almost 340 basis points.
We've made great strides with respect to our credit risk profile, where we've reduced nonperforming assets by 54% and charge-offs by 63%, while our allowance for loan losses remains at a very strong and solid level of 2.3% of net loans.
And finally, our capital and liquidity have improved significantly. Our Tier 1 now stands at 11.2% and our loan deposit ratio at 79%. Our performance, thus far, in 2013 demonstrates that we are successful in moving forward, and we are positioning our company for growth. We have emerged in the financial crisis stronger than before, with a solid capital base and a strong presence in some of the fastest growing markets in our country.
Now let's take a detailed look at the balance sheet. At the end of first quarter, total loans were almost $74 billion and remained steady from the prior quarter. Our commercial and industrial and indirect auto loan portfolios continued to produce solid results.
In addition, we experienced a slower pace of decline in the investor real estate segment. At quarter end, investor real estate balances stood at $7.3 billion, down $2.8 billion from 1 year ago. We estimate that we have approximately $800 million of derisking remaining in this investor real estate portfolio. Importantly, new production in investor real estate portfolio has begun to pick up as we see more opportunities in our markets to make loans to qualified borrowers consistent with our risk appetite.
We experienced a very solid quarter in our commercial and industrial portfolio. But more encouragingly, we saw a broadening of our commercial loan activity across well diversified base of industries and geographies, resulting in overall business loans, increasing $268 million linked quarter. Furthermore, a very promising change with line utilization increased to 140 basis points for 44.8% from the end of the prior quarter. Our commitments were also up a strong 12% from the prior year.
Turning to consumer lending for just a moment. During the fourth quarter, we began the process of retaining our 15-year fixed-rate first residential mortgages on the balance sheet. This strategy really supports our overall efforts to grow the balance sheet and effectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk. This resulted in approximately $180 million of additional loans held on the balance sheet during the first quarter.
Declines in our home equity portfolio, which include lines and loans, continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance and opportunities to deleverage. However, we are encouraged by the results of our home equity loan portfolio as loan production increased 60% over prior year, primarily due to the introduction of a fixed-rate loan product in the third quarter of last year. Growth in this product is expected to continue to reduce the pace of decline in our overall equity portfolio.
Indirect loans increased a strong 6% quarter-over-quarter, and total production is up 16% as we continue to expand our Durbin network. At quarter end, we had approximately 2,000 dealers and plan to add an additional 300 dealers by the end of the year.
Credit card balances were down this quarter, but our production of new accounts was 7% higher than prior year. Currently, our penetration rate is approximately 12% of the households that we bank. We expect this penetration rate to increase more than 20% over time. We have planned a comprehensive marketing campaign for credit cards throughout 2013 in our franchise, in our footprint to our customers.
We are pleased with progress we've made in the first quarter on holding loans steady. And as a result, we continue to believe and have confidence in our forecast to grow loans in the low single digits for 2013 point to point.
Another area of opportunity for improving is our net interest margin. Despite another challenging year of low interest rates, we were able to modestly expand our net interest margin by 4 basis points over the same period a year earlier. We have reduced the gap to our peers from 43 basis points down to 26 basis point and continue to expect our margin to remain relatively stable throughout 2013. Of course, a rise in interest rates would further benefit the overall margin.
Now let's move for a moment over the liability side of the balance sheet and some key drivers. Deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the first quarter. Total average low-cost deposits increased $375 million linked quarter and time deposits fell to just 14% of total average deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining 4 basis points down to 18 basis points for the quarter. Decline in deposit cost really aided the improvement in our net interest margin. Our deposit cost of 18 basis points in the first quarter is now among the lowest in our peer group.
Furthermore, our overall total funding costs improved to 45 basis points, a decrease of 86 basis points over the last 3 years. Our recently completed liability management activities will help further reduce our overall funding costs going forward, and we continue to evaluate other remaining opportunities that we may have.
In addition, we have an additional $5.6 billion of time deposits maturing in 2013 at an average rate of 93 basis points. This really compares favorably to right now our new ongoing rates for new CDs, which are averaging approximately 25 basis points.
We are focused on creating positive operating leverage, not only through revenue, but also through expense management. Importantly, at Regions, we believe the expense management should not be -- should be part of our culture and not just a campaign. And this strategy really is yielding some very positive results.
At the end of the quarter, noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets stood at 2.9%, which is the third lowest in our peer group. As evidenced, the successful efforts over the past year, we have reduced expenses faster than almost all of our peers. But looking ahead, 2013 expenses from continuing operations really are expected to be below those of 2012 expenses. This really illustrates our continued commitment to managing expenses and generating a positive operating leverage.
Turning now to asset quality, this is another area where we continue to make improvements. The provision for loan losses in the first quarter was $10 million or $107 million less than that charge-offs. Net charge-offs were down 46% compared to first quarter last year, and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were just below 1%. Both nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined year-over-year, both 26% and 32%, respectively.
In addition, delinquencies also declined 14%. Notably criticized and classified loans, which is one of our best and earliest indicators of asset quality, continued to decline with commercial, investor real estate loans down 31% since the first quarter of 2012.
In addition, our coverage ratios remained solid. Our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans stood at 110%. Meanwhile, our loan-loss allowance, as I mentioned earlier, is at 2.37% at the end of the third first quarter, well above peer median.
Based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward. As this occurs, we anticipate that our allowance for loan losses to total loans will continue to decline, aligning more closely with that of our peers. In short, while we've made great strides in the area overall, significant credit leverage remains on our balance sheet.
Finally, we looked to our plans for future growth. But first let's look at capital and liquidity. Our Tier 1 common ratio continues to increase, ending the first quarter at 11.2%, an approximate 160 basis point improvement over the first quarter of '12. And based on our interpretation, our Basel III estimate was 9.1%, above the stated required minimums.
During the first quarter, our board authorized a new $350 million common stock repurchase plan. This program is underway. And through May 6, the company had repurchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock.
Our liquidity position also remained solid as our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at approximately 79% at the end of the first quarter, which compares favorably to our peer median of approximately 88%. Our loan-loss-to-deposit ratio serves as further evidence that we're well positioned to take advantage of prudent lending opportunities as they arise.
We recently announced an enhanced approach to serving customers based on the concept of creating shared value for our customers, our communities, our associates and our shareholders through a program we branded Regions 360. The objective of this approach is to first and fully understand the customer's financial situation and then provide appropriate services and products to meet their needs and assist them in achieving their financial goals.
The rollout of this strategy is on a fast track, with related incentives already in place and training. We believe this new program, this new strategy will enhance our efforts to beat and expand customer relationships and grow our company going forward. As we move forward and try to transition more to our growth strategy, the concept of creating shared value will serve as our guiding principle. You notice that we've built an integrated approach to how we grow across all of our lines of businesses and across all our markets.
Our consumer line of business really provides a diversified product set and a diversified revenue stream across multiple channels with over 1,700 bank branches and 2,000 ATMs. As we move forward with this strategy, we continue to see opportunities to grow our consumer business.
We've launched a new set of banking products called Now Banking. We are able to better serve today all of our customers, many of which would be considered underserved by the banking industry. We continue to invest in lower-cost delivery channels, such as online, deposit smart ATMs and mobile banking. Adoption rates in these channels have been very high, primarily led by mobile banking, which increased -- we saw and experienced and increase of over 50% utilization from a year ago.
And Regions Business Services is really focused on serving small business and middle-market clients and large corporate lines and commercial real estate clients. Business Services loans today comprised approximately 61% of our total loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter. And our Wealth Management Group really tries to integrate institutional services, private wealth and investment services, as well as insurance into a single line of business. This line of business really does enable us to focus on our key profitable customers segment with a goal of increasing noninterest revenues and deepening our customer relationships and ultimately enhancing the value of the organization.
And finally, through enhanced services and investments on our technology platforms, we are starting to see our ability to grow as we better meet the needs of our customers and our geographies across all of our markets.
I want to emphasize that we truly are a different company today than we were a few years ago. We've built strong platforms across all lines of businesses and across all markets. This platform allows us now to be in a position to start prudently growing our business.
We've introduced the branded Regions 360 program, which will deepen our customer relationships, and we will believe we're already starting to see the indication of some pretty strong household growth.
We continue to increase our loan production and to leverage across all of our banking products. We continue to make investments in technology across all channels, and we continue to enhance the productivity of our lower-cost delivery channels, as well as our sales and service platforms.
We do remain focused on expense management disciplines, and we really are committed to generating positive operating leverage in a prechallenging market.
As we focus on moving forward, we believe we're now positioned better today than ever before to be more effective and more committed to creating shared value for our customers, our associates, our communities and our shareholders.
With that, I'll stop and take -- Dave and I will be glad to take questions. Thank you for your time.
Question-and-Answer Session
O. B. Grayson Hall
Questions?
Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Somebody's got to have a question.
Unknown Analyst
Can you just give us a sense of management incentives, and what are the priorities within the LTIP or whatever the remuneration structures that remain for this year, next year? And part of my reason for asking is because I'm interested to know how much pressure you're going to put yourselves on this to shrink the NIM differential with your peers because what we're hearing from a lot of banks is there's just not a lot of loan demand out there or the risk awards were not attractive, and obviously, operating leverage is one the ways to get there. But how do you balance up those 2? Does it matter if your NIM doesn't get closer to the peers if you just can't find the right business line at the right price?
O. B. Grayson Hall
Yes, I mean, I'll start and I'll let David add to it. But really when you look at our NIM, we have underperformed our peer group from a net interest margin really since the earliest days of the credit prices, and that was predominantly because we really had a larger mix of variable rate lending to fixed-rate lending in our balance sheet. And so we suffered early. And as our assets price down, it put a lot of pressure on our net interest margin, we responded to that. I would tell you at the time, if you looked at our deposit cost as an organization 4 years or 5 years ago, we would have fallen into sort of some of the upper quartile of deposit pricing compared to our peers. So we've managed deposit costs down pretty aggressively, and now I think compared very favorably to peer. So why is our margin still not at peer level? And it still is because we had very little fixed-rate lending going into this and the loan yields have priced down. We still have this differential between the 2. Obviously, in this rate environment, there's a lot of compression on -- a lot of compression on net interest margins. And we signal, we believe we can keep this margin stable through the end of the year because we do believe we still got -- we still have some ability to execute on deposit pricing, plus we've just taken some actions on the liability side of the balance sheet to try to improve our funding cost. So we think we've got that opportunity to do that. That being said, the longer this rate environment continues, the more difficult that's going to be, hence, why we've sort of limited our guidance through the end of '13. From an incentive perspective, we tried to be very balanced with our team. Clearly, we want to incent growth, but it's got to be prudent growth. And so we've taken a very balanced approach to that because while there's limited demand for credit, we are very dominant in some of the markets we're in. We still see opportunities to generate loan growth, albeit modest. We predicted low single-digit kind of growth. The biggest place that comes from us is not in dramatically increasing our loan production, but more so comes from a slower level of attrition on our commercial real estate portfolio. Our commercial real estate portfolio was outsized at the beginning of the recession and we've whopped that down, ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in the first quarter. We believe that the attrition of that segment slows production still while -- loan production in that segment while still slow is improving. We had roughly $1 billion of production in commercial real estate in 2011. We had roughly $2 billion in 2012, and the early days of 2013 would indicate we should have a strong year this year with a broader demand in that segment. That being said, these are still some very low levels.
David J. Turner
Yes, and I would say you specifically asked about the LTIP in terms of the performance measures there. So change in growth and earnings per share and return on tangible common equity of the 2 measures that we have for our LTIP is disclosed in our proxy. With...
O. B. Grayson Hall
That's on an absolute and relative basis.
David J. Turner
Yes, 50% of that is absolute and 50% of that's relative. So we have pretty good mix we think that, that ensures that we're looking for profitability. So what that tries to achieve is we'd love to grow loans. We would love to grow our revenue. But if we're not being paid for the risk that we take, then that won't happen. We have seen some pressure, in particular, in the large corporate space. Our bread and butter is really small business and commercial middle market, the lower end of that, where price sensitivity is not as high. The demand for credit in that space, though, is not as strong as we would like to see. That being said, we're seeing some early indications that, that might be starting. It's too early to call. You see what the equity markets are doing. We can see some deposits that are starting to be put to use by companies. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and think that we're about to have a runaway economy here. But we are seeing some indications. But the governors [ph] that we have on our performance is really profitability, not a volume shop. We did that before, that's not a good long-term strategy.
Unknown Analyst
I guess, you are very asset sensitive and that's why you're retaining some of the 15-year mortgage fixed rates. But taking into account this part of the cycle, how much appetite you've got for retention of mortgages in the balance sheet, and what should be on the duration of the book?
O. B. Grayson Hall
Yes, we've got -- I would tell you that we are only retaining the 15-year product because we believe from an interest rate risk standpoint, that's a more prudent step to take. We also are doing things in our treasury group to mitigate some of the duration risk of that asset. In addition, our investment portfolio is roughly $27 billion, 25% of earning assets. There's an awful lot of mortgage product in that investment portfolio. And I'll let Dave talk a little bit about specific risk management mitigations that we're taking on both of those asset classes.
David J. Turner
Yes, we looked at the 15-year product and we had been selling everything to generate the gains. We felt the spread there made better sense for us to harvest those gains. It's starting to get to a point where, I think, from a market standpoint, that, that was viewed as not sustainable from a gain standpoint and a little bit of criticism in the lack of loan growth. So we made a decision, given the capital position that we're in, given our strong liquidity that we give up a little bit of the game, put loans on our books. And as Grayson mentioned in his prepared comments, $180 million of those loans were put on the balance sheet in the first quarter. So not a big change. But we like that profile better from a NIM standpoint, too, because the alternative would be a $175 mortgage-backed security, which is we have plenty of those already. So that's really why we made that change. We think right now, given the mortgage outlook, this is the right strategy to have for the foreseeable future.
O. B. Grayson Hall
And this is incremental step, I'd say $180 million first quarter. Yes?
Unknown Analyst
Looking at your -- looking at the crisis in a couple of years, you had provisions, which over 300 basis points and now you have 400 basis points of loans, I think. And yet your preprovisioned profits to loans is only 230 basis points per annum, that type of thing. If you compare that to other banks, such as the couple we've seen this morning, where the preprovisioned profit is 350, 400 basis points to loans. It means that they are much more able to withstand the crisis. And the performance -- long-term performance of the banks is all determined by the bad years, not the good years really. So my question is, is there something you can do to improve your preprovisioned profitability so that we know that we can get through these bad debt cycles with certainty?
O. B. Grayson Hall
That's a great question, and you're absolutely correct. I mean, if you look at our institution today, it's a pretty simple business model today. And we're predominantly a spread bank. We've had a number of things occur that have reduced our noninterest revenue flows. We've been working very diligently to introduce new products that generate some noninterest revenue. You saw those products we introduce through our Now Banking suite for the underbanked segment. We've also introduced a strategy of growing our insurance business. We've been lifting out a number of teams across our footprint to try to generate more volume there. But if you look at our preprovisioned income, the biggest one-time increase would be if the interest rate environment became more normalized. But when you look at us relative to peer, we're just a straightforward spread bank today and a very much at the mercy of the rate environment that we're in. Our preprovision, obviously, as the economy improves, as interest rates normalize, we'll see a much better preprovision. But we also, as a company, recognize we've got to find ways to generate more revenues outside of net interest income.
David J. Turner
Let me add to that, because you're speaking to the first line of defense with regards to an issue that would come up. And clearly, if you were to look at our PPNR, the risk weighted assets, you would see we're right there with the peer group. Our risk-weighted assets, we have Tennessee risk-weighted assets divided by average assets, we're on the lower end of that because we've been in such a derisking mode that we've taken our risk out of our balance sheet. So our job is really to rerisk in an appropriate fashion because if you're not taking some measured risk, you're not going to get the carry, you're not going to make the money that you need to make from a PPNR first line of defense standpoint. That being said, we have -- you saw our allowance loan loss relative to our peers, about 60 basis points higher than our peers. And I think if you look at Tier 1 common, we're also about a whole point higher than our peers. So we have second, third line defenses that are stronger than the peers to the extent there was some form of downturn. And clearly our risk weights are lower. If you believe in the merit of risk weighting, and whether you do or not, at least on a relative basis to the peers, we're lower. So our job is really to really get our PPNR stronger by taking some incremental risk. If you look at our PPNR over this troubled time, our PPNR is fairly predictable for us. And really our issue is losses coming through the credit book, which was related to the concentration risk we had by putting 2 real estate banks together in 2006, 2 real estate companies in the Southeast, in Florida and Georgia. I mean, we had the perfect storm, and that's what we've been digging out of for about 3 years. So we've gotten that pretty much done, and now it's rerisking and growing revenue.
O. B. Grayson Hall
But we're rerisking prudently.
Unknown Analyst
If you look at the [indiscernible] the profitability of the [indiscernible] market growth, you are dimensionally net [indiscernible] the drop in lending banks, you actually have a lot [indiscernible]. And I proposed you regret those [indiscernible] and I think you had [indiscernible].
David J. Turner
I would say part of the reason for that is the mix of our loan book relative to our peers. So today we're about 61% Business Services, 39% consumer. Our peers have a tendency to be closer to 50-50. And when you look at that 50-50 and put consumer assets -- and let me just use one example. So we have about, call it, $900 billion credit card book, it's about 1.5%. We have some of our peers, not talking about the credit card banks, but some of our peers are at 8%. So obviously, losses are going to be higher than that, but they're predictable and the spread there is great. So that's going to help their NII as you go forward. So we're trying to rerisk and change our mix from Business Services to consumer slightly in a prudent way. And we do that through a couple of things. Well, that's why we bought our credit card book back from Bank of America, that's why we're investing in growing our dealer network on our indirect auto book because we like the profile of that credit. And over time, we will get there, just going to take us slower because as we've tried to move that mix, which just, in all transparencies, been about the same for the 3 years up and talking about this, we've been derisking on the commercial side, Business Services side, and the consumers have been deleveraging. So we've been chasing each other trying to get the mix shift and it hasn't occurred. We think we can, in time, change that though, which would drive that profitability for us.
Unknown Analyst
I guess, Grayson, you've mentioned adding through into more indirect auto dealers, I wonder if you could talk to kind of what you're seeing in that business. A couple of people had mentioned that being incremental and more competitive, and there's been some other concerns around the CFPB's role in terms of dealing with the dealers and bank in truth in lending, can you flesh that out for us?
O. B. Grayson Hall
Yes, I mean I think, one, it continues to be a very strong market. I think the latest forecast is there should be about 15 million units sales this year in the U.S. Of that financing market, commercial banks make up about 43% of the financing the new auto bills in the country. Obviously, it's a more competitive business than it was a year ago or 2 years ago. A number of people have reentered the business or have reenergized the business that they had. We've been in those business for a long time. As you may recall, we exited this business early in sort of the economic recession, and we just reentered it about 18 months ago. We're relatively a small player in this market. We have less than 1% market share, actually of that 0.10% market share. So we're relatively a small player in this thing. We're showing good growth. I guess, our portfolio is, what, $2.5 billion today. And so we're showing good growth and we're adding dealers. We like the business. We've stayed in the prime part of this business. We have, for the most part, all of our paper that we're generating, all our loans we're generating from our 2,000 dealers are pretty solid in that prime space. We do have the concern about how this business is going to be regulated. Clearly, the CFPB has come out with some guidance regarding that. We are a small player, and we're watching to see what the market does. When we reentered the business, we -- with one rate sheet franchise lodged. So we don't have a differentiated rate sheets across our market. We also don't allow any of our bankers to exercise any discretion on pricing related to auto loans. We do allow the dealers, which is to practicing in that business with the auto dealers to be able to mark up the loans. We allowed up to 200 basis points. We're reevaluating that policy, and we are experimenting with some markets, with some dealers on a different pricing model. We're watching it to see where it goes. Clearly, that business model is in the process of adjustment. And we believe, though, if it adjusts, we still believe we can be competitive in that market.
David J. Turner
I think one thing to add to that is the banks represent just over 40% of that market. The rest of it is really related to captives and credit unions and other players. So the CFPB, which obviously doesn't have jurisdiction over them, is evaluating what they really want to happen, too. And we don't believe they want the banks out of the business, but there could be changes we will adapt and overcome and move forward.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Yes, sir?
Unknown Analyst
You described the environment as challenging. I assume that means the top line revenue is going to be -- remain challenging because of lack of loan growth or margin pressured competition. What in your view is preventing market consolidation? Is it the regulators, is it management's unhappy with the price that stocks are trading in?
O. B. Grayson Hall
Yes, I mean, I'll get these numbers slightly wrong. I think in the last FDIC report, there's some 7,100 banks in the U.S. today, 600 to 900 of them are under $1 billion. Yes, I think, there's been a lot of people speculate it. Consolidation for a lot of reasons will occur in this industry in the U.S. going forward. I don't disagree with that. The question is when. I think today, there are still enough uncertainty over the economic recovery. There's uncertainty over the sort of regulatory environment around certain businesses, we just discussed one in direct lending, that you haven't seen a lot of activity. Most of the consolidation in the U.S. has been relatively smaller institutions, buying other smaller institutions. I do think it's going to take a little while for the economy to improve and for there to be more certainty over our businesses before that consolidation becomes stronger. I do share the belief that consolidation will increase over time and the question's just when.
David J. Turner
Yes, I think that, clearly, we'll -- we've been talking about when it's going to start now for a couple of years. And I think we have a new regulatory regime we're looking at, obviously, with CCAR, and capital usage is part of that. M&A, I think we all have to agree, M&A in the banking sector had been particularly stellar. And so I think people want to be particularly careful about it, pricing. Once stock price also is coming into play as you've mentioned. And the end market cost takeout, those work unless you own to market, and if you own the market, then you're going to divest everything you just acquired. So that doesn't work. But if you go to those markets where you don't control, those could be opportunities at the right time, at the right price. One of the key issues we look at is removing the uncertainty from the marketplace. So that you can actually take the net assets that you just acquired and do something with it, push your end customers, push your products and services through the channel, to get to those customers to grow your revenue and you hate to go onto a deal, where that deal was strictly related to revenue synergies because that's a tough thing to prove, especially to investors, but a cost play with some revenue synergy when the time is right, I think you will see that. And I think we're all looking for a little bit of relief of the uncertainty out there.

I do think the original banks have, particularly, a strong position in that. If you've got your balance sheet cleaned up, you got your business running well, if you're on a single technology platform and you've got a demonstrated ability to integrate quickly, I do think regional banks have a window of opportunity that will open at some point to try to take advantage of that consolidation opportunity.
David J. Turner
Yes, I'll add the capital, too. So you saw our capital numbers, in particular, Tier 1 common. You've also seen our stress capital, as well. We would like to use that capital to grow and -- organically and particularly, but to the extent that that's harder to come by, then you have an opportunity to acquire either a line of business or an entity, that's certainly something we evaluate. And when those don't happen, returning it to the shareholders seems to be the best thing to do. So we've had -- you saw our dividend increase and our return to the shareholders in total, a little over $500 million this year.

We've ran out of time, we can take one more question if there's one more. I think we've got about 1 minute left. Anybody?
Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Grayson. You showed a slide before kind of your overall U.S. market share and then your kind of market share in your core markets. I was expecting your clinical noncore markets obviously have lower share. I know you've been kind of closing consolidating the branches over the past several years. But any thoughts on kind of maybe more rapidly deemphasizing those noncore markets and kind of redeploying that capital into the kind of more -- the core markets, where you seem to be more focused.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Jason, we took a hard look at that back when capital really was in limited supply, if you will. And we looked at it hard. And still came with the conclusion that those markets are still very accretive to earnings. We've been more aggressive than almost any of our peers since '07. We've closed and consolidated some 16% of our branch offices. We still continue to believe that the branch office is irrelevant part of our delivery strategy. We do believe over time they become smaller, that they become less transaction oriented, more sales and service oriented, and have more technology, but also have to have a lower operating expense on an individual basis. So we're continuing to use technology to drive the expense of a branch office down further. We've installed image capability on all of our total lines so we don't have all the transportation expense around transactions and payments. We continue to put technology into our ATMs, into our mobile channel, into our web-based services to try to pull more transaction activity in all of our branches. And transactions are coming out of the branches. But today, 80% of our new account sales do come out of those branch offices. So we still are looking at these physical points presence in the market. It's a relative part of our delivery strategy, and we do have a number of markets, where we're sort of a low share player, and we continue to look at those markets literally on a very disciplined basis. But right now, we still are able to believe that those markets are accretive to earnings. We don't have a way to redeploy that capital today in an effective manner. So we're going to try to optimize the earnings of what we have in place.
David J. Turner
I would add to that, Jason, that if you look at our -- if you try to the normal measures deposits by branch and all those metrics, you likely would get an answer. You really need to think about the cost that we have in those branches or the lack thereof. We really have done a pretty good job managing across the franchise, and certainly don't want to have that measure as the justification for the number of branches that we have. But to point out, there's a little different measure you might want to look at. The second piece of that is we constantly look at our markets to the extent we think consolidation of branches makes sense. Every time, you do that, you lose a revenue. But if we lose more expense than revenue, then that makes sense to do it, and we will continue that path. So we're not going to stop here. But we'll also make investments in places that we need more density as well.
