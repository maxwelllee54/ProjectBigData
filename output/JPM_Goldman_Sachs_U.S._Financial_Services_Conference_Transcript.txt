Richard Ramsden
Okay. Thank you everybody. We are going to get started with our next presentation. I am delighted to have Marianne Lake up next. I don’t think Marianne needs any introduction. She is completing her third year as CFO of JPMorgan. And I do think it’s fair to say that in a very short period of time she has established herself as one of the standout CFO’s in the banking industry. So, Marianne, thank you very much for joining us.
Marianne Lake
Thank you.
Richard Ramsden
I thought a logical place to start would be how you are thinking about ’16 and I guess, really the question as you are going through your budgetary process today? What sort of economic backdrop are you expecting for next year and how does that differ compared to what we’ve gone through in 2015?
Marianne Lake
So as we think about, I’ll comment how it plays into our budgeting and offer a strategic decision making in a second, but generally our outlook for 2016 is fairly constructive as to the U.S. to be on a continued positive moderate growth about 2.25 in GDP. We, obviously, think, the data has been supportive coming into year end and we think that will continue in 2016.
So S&P to deliver some returns next year, 5%, 6%, something like that. As you, I am sure we are going to discuss later, we will talk about index, right, no doubt, and we typically been on a side of suggesting that we don’t have any better insights on interest rates than the market. So that sort of bid also is lift off December with two hike, finish off December with four hikes and we can talk later about that means practically speaking to 2016 financially.
Then just general Europe doing is same, global growth still there, emerging markets broadly stabilizing at lower levels, clearly presently just little bit of challenge. But no sort of really big new news and I suppose how that differs from 2016 is more of the same generally a little bit more constructive and we will see about volatility, because naturally as we see some the monetary post reactions, I think, we can expect decent volatility and we just have to see that as it play through.
I will say that when it plays out into our budgeting, we try not get overly focused on whether or not we can call interest rates or credit or any of those other things perfectly right in terms of the timing, because our investment decisions are strategic decisions are much longer term decisions than that and so our point of view about how we see the global economy over the medium-term has not fundamentally changed and consequently our strategies have not fundamentally changed. We think we have some really interesting and exciting opportunities to invest and we have to take advantage of those almost no matter the environmental factors.
So when we think about budgeting for 2016, obviously, they play apart, we sensitized the results based on what the outcomes could be, but we really think about making the right long-term decisions in terms of how we think about co-efficiencies and how we think about investments in the business.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So what they outcome of the FOMC Meeting next week, has any impact on your 2016 budgetary process? I am assuming that you like most other people are take into granted the first 25 basis points, let’s hope…
Marianne Lake
The near 32, but it’s uncertain.
Richard Ramsden
Near 32 and but, I guess, is there anything in the language that you are going to be looking at as you have think about preparing for 2016?
Marianne Lake
So, I mean, we are going to be obviously watching it very carefully as you all well. And specifically, what will be interesting, I think, are most interesting, assuming little right, because, obviously, will be interesting if we are not. Then what would be most interesting is thing what they do with the dots, because will they continue to have the dots employing, the communications telegraph is gradual, take our time to be patience that data to be process and I think we would characterize 2016 is ultimately will be driven more validates than the dots. I think it will be interesting to see what the telegraph in terms of 2016 is playing, is it more like the market and why does the market under priced relative to the expectation, but it’s not going to fundamentally change, how we think about next year, we’ll changed the outcome in one year and it won’t change the long-term outcome as far as they are concerned.
Richard Ramsden
Okay.
Marianne Lake
And, I think, one other things that people have asked us that is, what is if you see one hike, what is if you see two hike, what is if you don’t, then you see that, possible, I don’t think it’s any one central case that is going to be one hike, I mean, the thing is very patience. And so the idea that that there will be other than slower gradual raises, I think, it is unlikely and I think it isn’t right. If it because of some sort of market event or some sort of policy mistake or something than I think we have to over trough, but if it just a little bit slower or a little bit faster than we expect than fundamentally it will change our perspectives on 2016 budget and our long-term investment in the business.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. I mean, when rates go up, obviously, deposit rate is something, I think, that people care a lot about? A couple of questions, the first is, when you get the first rate rise, what are you going to be tracking to figure out whether the asset sensitivity that you have disclosed is coming through or if its better or if its worst, isn’t just deposit re-pricing and deposit outflows, or is it more complex than that?
And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit around your expectations of re-pricing between retail, wholesale and also geographically if you think there will be any differences to both how the pricing will evolve?
Marianne Lake
So, look, at the end of the day, I think, we start to talking about this pretty widely, two years ago now at this point and fundamentally our point of view haven’t changed with this. As a general matter over the tightening cycle we are expecting re-price sensitivity to be higher and reasonably meaningfully so than in prior cycles, but we don’t know how to model that any more accurately day in and day out, but we want to be a properly conservative on that point. And therefore the reasons that we have talked about, so it competition, so a very high positive retail, deposit liquidity, a very, very key awareness broadly in the desire to sharing higher interest rates there, technology as well as all those things.
But whether it’s convicted to that and so with wholesales deposit flows, as well as with traditional reprice lag, you are going to see a bit less of that in the first couple of hikes than you will see the first 50 basis points less than the second, third, fourth, et cetera, and I think what you have to watch most particularly is the invested landscape.
I think that it’s going to be competition. I think it’s going to evolve more slowly. It’s not going to be such change is radical and we will continue to defend our position. And we are not -- the not highest pay person on deposits, we are going to, necessarily have to be, but we want to continue to grow our deposit strongly, because they are an indication of the debt in terms of violation of gross estimates. And we’ve been growing 9% year-over-year pretty consistently or thereabout, and overtime we think that will slowdown, but we still think we will be growing.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. And then what the Fed does with the size of the reverse repo facility? Does that impact or you will have to pay for short dated customer deposits, does that change your thought process in anyway?
Marianne Lake
Not really because I think that based in pretty consistent. So the -- us -- our belief is that the RFP, the size of the RFP we believe it’s going to be use to make sure of that they are effective and getting short rate to trade in the corridor between the 9% repo rate and IVR and that I don’t know whether they are going to come out the gates and go to a $750 billion number, we don’t know, but they have the flexibility to adjust that lever and show the rates trading in that corridor and fundamentally that’s what we are expecting. There will be some volatility. But I don’t think it’s going to have a first or the direct impact on how we see that translate to the first move over the incrementally on deposit pricing for the first one or two hikes.
Richard Ramsden
Yeah. And then, again, let’s just take a scenario where interest rates perhaps go up faster than the market pricing and as a result of that your revenue growth exceeds what you would budget as of today? How would you way up investing in the business versus delivering operating leverage? And I guess the question, I am trying to get to it, do you have a list of things that you would invest in, if revenue growth was higher purely as a result of interest rates going up?
Marianne Lake
So, I hope that you would agree with us that if we have very compelling and accretive investments in the businesses that we ought to be willing to make them, not regardless of the economic environment, but not because of an incremental 25 basis points in any one year. So if rates are rising and they are rising for the right reasons on the back of a relatively solid economic backdrop in the U.S. and globally than we ought to be making all of the right investments that we can in our business, because we have a great hand and we should take advantage of that right now.
So it isn’t the case that we have a list and we have a cut-off if rates do rise, our cut-off is, is it adding shareholder value with a high degree of certainty, is it attracting great client, is it developing great products, is it going to drive long-term growth and performance, not is it going to drive a better 2016.
And I am not saying that we don’t intend to be incredibly disciplined about how we think of our core expenses and how much of that we can self fund. But we have very meaningful investment outlined in our 2016 budgets and they are not materially right decision depending upon rate environment.
Richard Ramsden
Okay.
Marianne Lake
And I believe they are compelling and we will certainly share those review in the fullness of time and you can judge for yourself. But there are investments in acquiring customers and building technology, and simplifying services and growing the business over the medium-term.
Richard Ramsden
Can you talk little bit more broadly about your strategic objectives in 2016 because I do think it’s fair to say that when you were here last year, you set out a number of objectives. And I think you have actually met most of those. So as you head in ‘16 and beyond, what are the two or three most important strategic objectives that you have for the business?
Marianne Lake
Sure. I think if you look at -- and actually one of the things that I feel that you will agree with me on it that we feel reasonably consistent enough to grow strategic objectives over the course of recent history. So I don’t think anything that I will tell you that is a priority for us in 2016 will be materially new to you and in 2016, also lot of focus for us was on executing on our commitment on expenses, on balance sheet, on capital efficiency, on capital levers. And I feel like we’ve been very successful and also getting behind us a lot more of the regulatory and control burden but at the same time, we outlined our investments in digital, in payments, in the past two, top three in strategic areas in CIB, adding bankers in the commercial banking, all of that is what we are going to be doing in 2016.
So if I look into 2016, we are adding hundreds of revenue synergies across our businesses at CIB and CB but also in AM. We are investing in significant marketing, so considering the businesses broadly and customer acquisitions, obviously technology and including but not limited to digital enablement across businesses as well as obviously total payments. So none of its new or changed and it’s the evolution of the same strategies laid out this year. And we’re going to do those as hard and fast as we can.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So as we turn to the operating environment, so loan growth obviously is one of the key metrics, I think people are focused on. You come out and set core loan growth of 15% which is above the 10% you initially gave at the Investor Day, some of that is obviously your decision to portfolio mortgages. Can we talk a little bit about what drove the difference between 10% to 15%. And as you look at ‘16, what are your expectations in terms of how loan demand is going to evolve in the context of a higher rate environment?
Marianne Lake
So look -- obviously we try to do the best we can guiding in Investor Day and I think 10% core loan growth was our central expectation. We’ve seen significant growth in mortgages driving a reasonable portion of variances between 10% to 15% and that’s a good decision for us. We love those mortgages half but they are more than half of the jumbo mortgages. These are clients that we like. The funding cost are lower, the servicing risks are lower. So for us, that has been a great trade but even underlying that the core loan growth has been the right side of 10%.
And it’s been reasonably good in 2015. In 2016, we’re expecting loan demand to continue to be solid to robust across products. So it does differ. I mean, we are hoping to get the loan growth in the card basis. The investments we’re making to sort of move up from very low single digits to something closer to mid single digit. And obviously, in the wholesale space it will be more of that like but then beyond that and also in business banking, obviously in mortgage and asset management, we continue to expect equivalent growth in the high single digit, if not in same cases double digit.
So again we’re expecting to have a reasonable amount of mortgages in our portfolio next year. So the bid off were between 10% and 15% core loan growth is there depending upon how we fight back but it’s still going to be pretty robust across the products. And to be honest with you, I think that -- again when I come back and comment, that I said which is our expectations is that we’re going to have a reasonably solid economic footing but maybe some downside emerging market risk but fundamentally solid footing and with that confidence continues to grow and with that the demand that we have been seeing to continue to be there. I don’t see step-changing but it’s contemplated in our thinking.
Richard Ramsden
I think with the dramatic increase in liquidity and consumer accounts today relative to where we were pre-practices have surprised people. And if anything, it feels like lower energy prices have led to a repayment boom as opposed to a spending boom. Would you first agree with that observation and secondly, what do you think changes that?
Marianne Lake
So we have some research. I think the Chase Institute did suggest maybe there are a little bit more of it is actually being expense than an insignificant amount and I forget the precise numbers. So typically when you see things like an energy dividend that you see people save that in the first instance and it takes a while for spending to catch up. But I think our sense is that more of it being spent and necessarily come true in card sales data. And I said that our retail spend, card spend and consumer spend will continue to be pretty robust in 2016.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. On the security side of the business, the restructuring especially out of Europe continues but there is obviously restructuring taking place specifically with fixed income in the U.S. today. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the market show opportunity? I think what surprised people is that this isn’t a new phenomenon. This has now been going for sometime.
Marianne Lake
Going on?
Richard Ramsden
Yeah. We haven’t really seen a material change in the revenue picture of some of the U.S. firms. Why do you think that is and secondly, as balance sheet in that business has started to reprice, has that had a notable impact on volume?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So I think, look, as we comment on sort of competitive dynamics, there is three things. One is there is a lag between people making announcements about strategic restructuring of that business and that ultimately manifesting in a material change in the capacity of the environment that would allow people to start payment and depending from regulatory and legal obligations, that can be a fairly extended period, which is why it feels like it has been going on for long time you know, not very much has happened.
It’s the case of less capacity, there is an opportunity to step in but it’s also the case that for most people when they are making significant changes to their business model, they are shrinking or exiting or otherwise changing the businesses that were not really scaling that they didn’t have material market share and they weren’t particularly profitable in but maybe they didn’t have the best franchise in. Just a sweeping generalization but it’s largely true.
And so it’s not necessarily that the capacity is materially diminished and it makes competitors fiercely competitive in the things they are strong and that they are staying in. So the reality is there is still pensive competition across the board and for something particularly our fixed income market for -- which is transaction-oriented largely speaking for best clients they have options and they will continue to have options. And we just continue to belief the scale is critical and productivity is critical. And we have both of those things. So all our things are equal, we should do pretty well.
The repricing question is a little bit related I suppose which is where we have seen the most repricing in the industry has been in those obvious products where everybody for maybe different reasons has shared sort of a common constraint. So balance-sheet intensive reasons, whether you’re leverage constrained or GSIB constrained. We’ve seen repricing more in financing prime repos, a bit into clearing, not insignificant, not a game changer in terms of overall revenue but we have seen repricing there where you see a lesser gain is in the market-type business where unilateral repricing is more complicated.
And then in terms of -- we're not going to manifest ourselves in revenue story, the reality as a setback and I assume this is going to be an evolution or revolution. We are going to see it overtime and any puts and takes that may have already taken place are subdued in the overall size of the wallet. And there has been a lot of volatility and volume volatility stories over the course for the last couple of years and I think they are not some of what’s going on.
Speaking for us year-over-year anyway and of course, we think it had a little bit of noise in them but we’ve gained 20 basis points of fee share [indiscernible] over last year. We gained 60 basis points of market share third quarter year-to-date over year before. Every quarter has it story, every year has it is story but we feel very good about how we’re positioned and scale matters and we have that in our arsenal.
Richard Ramsden
How would you characterize the trending environment today within securities? And I think your last comment was activity picked up in November from a relatively low level in October. Has that continued into December? And then if we do get a rate hike next week, are you expecting a flurry of the year end activity around repositioning or do you think people have moved out of that given how consensual has become?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So a couple of things in the fourth quarter, actually before we get onto market and just one comment on fees which if you look at the -- and specifically in debt capital market. So if you look at debt capital market where the year-over-year wallet declines for the industry is about 36%. And if you look at JPMorgan’s DCM result in the fourth quarter of 2014, it was a record. It was a pretty gargantuan performance. So I’m just commenting relative to sort of average models right now that we would expect to be down at least in line with the industry and more in sort of 15% and 17% range which is where people have us right now. So I just wanted to make that comment.
Having said that, we feel great about the fee levels that we have at pipeline growing for 2016 feels good. Markets -- so I would say if you just step right back across the products, when we came into the fourth quarter, the first thing we said is let’s talk about the volatility. There was some noise and some activity levels as things got down. Coming into the fourth quarter, we saw a bit of pickup in activity, particularly in Europe in October, November. But then the ECB disappointed and fundamentally, I would say the overall, the quarter is characterized by being generally quieter.
And generally quieter whether it’s equities, equities Asia, in fixed income markets kind of broadly, are we guided to seeing reasonably normal seasonal declines quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter? And that hasn’t changed. So in any one week, you can see pickups here and there but at the end of the day, the overall quarter hasn’t changed in terms of the characterization.
We would expect that if the market is correct and again, not to oversell the certainty but the market is correct. And if we do see rates improve, should be step backs should be constructed to markets in 2016 broadly. I don’t think we are necessarily expecting it to have any particular impact on the results as we approach 2015 fourth quarter.
Richard Ramsden
Okay.
Marianne Lake
I think if you look into 2016, you would say, a rising U.S. interest rate environment with diverted monetary policy should be constructed for rates. We are hoping back the credit spreads market had a cyclical trough in 2015 and so, ’16 should be reasonably more often if it could be constructed. But I think single loan risk is the thing to watch there and the credit differentiation is significant and equities should be quite rolled off in 2015 and should remain so. I don’t think that’s going to play out in the next three weeks.
Richard Ramsden
Perhaps, can you talk a little bit about what you have seen in the high yield market over these spreads have opened up quite a bit? And I guess two questions. The first is when you look at that, is that in anyway a warning signal about credit quality deteriorating within C&I, or do you think that’s specific to the high yield market? And secondly, how has that impacted some of the credit rating businesses that you have?
Marianne Lake
So, we don’t see it as being a broader indication of credit deterioration and with respect to how it’s impacted our trading -- look overall, spot trading, credit trading in the quarter has been and particularly in secondary markets have been quite good, no particular impacts.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So more broadly on credit, are you seeing any deterioration in C&I outside of that or is it still quite contained? And then secondly, when you look at geographies that are more energy exposed and benchmark credit performance, either on the corporate or consumer side to those that don’t have a significant exposure to energy, are you seeing any noticeable differences at this point?
Marianne Lake
So if we look across our portfolio right now and think about the stresses that we are experiencing, they are reasonably tightly contained within energy sector. And specifically on borrowing base determinations downgraded to certain clients. We are seeing materials kind of secondary impact or other stress in the rest of the portfolio more broadly. That’s not to say there aren’t downgrades of individual names, not just thematically and materially not, and it’s really going to depend on -- we are expecting that things will remain relatively soft in 2016. But it depends on how stressed that would get as to whether if that would expand. Right now no. With respect to -- the second question was the geographies?
Richard Ramsden
Yeah.
Marianne Lake
So, I would just say we don’t see so. Look, at the end of the day, they are obviously, we are watching very carefully all of those geographies that have particular focus on energy related revenues or revenue income streams. There is some stressing of those as you can see in the unemployment rates being slightly elevated. But they are in best position than they have been in previous cycles like this.
They have more reserves and obviously more well diversified and everything. So from our perspective, as we look at the rest of our portfolio outside of the C&I. But if you look at the business banking and mortgages or commercial real estate, I would say we would characterize our exposures as being reasonably modest in the context of the overall portfolio and performance being relatively good.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. Perhaps I’m going to switch to CCAR. Your capital base has improved significantly this year. I think your CET1 ratio was up 130 basis points. You have also issued, I think $6 billion of preferred this year as well, which I think on one hand puts you in a very good position to increase your capital return ask by going into ’16. Against that, there is some uncertainty around how the test is going to evolve with, obviously further comments from the Fed implying that the minimum could go up over a period of time. How do you balance those two things off, when you think about the appropriate 2016 capital return ask?
Marianne Lake
So, I guess a couple things. The first is that there is no secret that we ended up being leverage constrained in the CCAR last year. And so it’s not enterprising that we took advantage of the opportunity of issue preferreds and relieved some of that pressure in order that we can move into enough expected payout range and that is certainly what we would like to be able to do into 2016 CCAR, is to pay out within our range and ideally towards the higher end of our range. And we been pretty clear as well that we would like to have the ultimate flexibility to be able to increase dividends and pay out preferreds more strongly. So that’s our expectation going into 2016. We can’t ignore.
Even though I know that the Fed, when they made that comment and say this, anything that would be proposed and subject to comment probably in the first quarter of next year, wouldn’t apply to 2016. Of course, as soon as the proposals are out, you have to contemplate what means for a longer term capital trajectory. So, capital planning isn’t a one-year event. And so what we would want to understand what that looks like and what the conformant periods look like and the variety of levers that we have to pull and then have a path to achieve whatever we need to do.
I think the probability -- so right now, as we sit here today based upon what we know today, which put aside what might come in the future, we have relieved the stress on our leverage ratio of being a constraint. We are 11.4% CET1 on under either measure. We are now at about a $1.5 trillion standardized risk based or asset based and so we hope to be able to pay out more strongly. And we showed you that our CCAR -- I showed you at Investor Day though. If CCAR were our binding constraint, we would pass CCAR at the lower 11%. So with our 12% target, we will continue to accrete towards little bit more slowly.
Richard Ramsden
Okay.
Marianne Lake
But if the Fed come out with higher minimums and I think that the central space is going to be higher, the question mark is how much and over what time period then we would have some reaction to that potentially in 2016 CCAR.
Richard Ramsden
A few banks have said that they think operational risk is going to play a more central role in the CS CCAR. Is that your expectation and what does that actually mean and what does that look like?
Marianne Lake
Candidly, I think operational risk played a central role in CCAR last year. I would say that speaking anyway for my experience, the operational risk stresses that we have in our CCAR stress test, I can’t speak exactly for what the Fed has as you know. But I can speak to how we have talked about in modern day and is extremely fair. And so as a result that is not one of the things that I think will meaningfully change this year. I can’t be sure. We haven’t had our detailed instructions yet, but I would tell you that speaking for our company, operational risks stresses in CCAR really adverse were very significant and played a very central role last year.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. One of the other things that when you mentioned this, of course the leverage was a binding constraint last year, you shrunk our balance sheet $150 billion. Are you now largely done, or do you think you could another exercise of that type in the years 2016?
Marianne Lake
But we shrunk the balance sheet by about $150 billion, the majority of the driver behind that was the elimination of the removal of the $150 plus billion of normal pricing deposits. And so as a result of which, we are very conducive intensive and so we are large speaking, held in cash on the balance sheet and so as a result, you saw almost direct impact of doing that on the size of our balance sheet.
We are settled down on that. We outperformed what we expected at Investor Day, $150 billion is a lot. We hope to -- obviously solidify that and maintain. I would also say that dealer with our inventories in equities and trading assets generally were lower in the third quarter than we had seen before. So, no, we are not expecting to continue to see another push like that. If anything strengthens our loan growth, we would argue for the margins, not put pressure on the balance sheet, not anything significant but not another step change down by $100 billion or $150 billion short.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. I think since we last spoke, we have had the initial proposal of the TLAC rules. Was that anything that surprised you in those rules? And then secondly, I think we’ve estimated your shortfall to be somewhere between $8 billion to $16 billion. Is that in the right ballpark? And then third, what do you think the appropriate buffer is to run on the TLAC ratios, or is that still work in progress?
Marianne Lake
So, I would say that there was some good news in final TLAC proposal on the basis that, from an external TLAC perspective anyway, both the calibration, 18% as well as buffer exclusions using method 1 for the GSIB buffer were on the positive side of our expectations. And as a result, external TLAC isn’t our binding constraints.
I wouldn’t characterize necessarily anything as surprising but perhaps, more surprising was the long-term debt ratio and inclusion of the USD to surcharge and that is more binding for us. Net-net, however, in terms of what that means for our shortfall over time, it’s a little higher, maybe $25 billion plus or minus but in the right ballpark.
So better than, I think sort of our rate case, when we were thinking that the external TLAC could have been 20% and buffer could have been defined differently. So that’s where we stand right now. And it’s pretty consistent anyway regarding indications about what we would be able to easily accommodate in the market, would easily absorb over the course of the next several years as we move to compliance.
Richard Ramsden
Well, we have some time left. So let’s see if there is any questions from the audience. Sure, one of them. Could we get a mic over on this side?
Question-and-Answer Session
Q -
Hi. JPMorgan has been one of the leaders in trying to kind of pass down added capital and liquidity requirements to kind of the desk level, the product level in terms of pricing. Can you give us a sense for kind of what you are pricing today? Are there any areas of regulation that aren’t incorporated at this point, maybe something like TLAC comes to mind?
Marianne Lake
So, when we think about -- so, if I think about the difference between how we sort of internally transfer price all of our constraints to the businesses and how ultimately that might affect itself in the price to a client or the street and things have become very complicated as you know over the course of last several years where each of our businesses and each of the desk maybe bound by different things. And so we are trying to be very thoughtful about how we think about what we add up to be to be something like 17 variations of binding constraints, so all of our businesses get allocated.
To them, what we think is the appropriate amount of TLAC, the appropriate amount of leverage, the appropriate amount of capital and they seek to inform their pricing using that. And to a lesser greater degree, we can be successful depending upon competitive dynamic. Having said that, what we measure them on is the overall return on the equity we provide them to, as long as they don’t fulfill of the other limits we give them.
So if you’re in CIB, yes, they are looking to incorporate LCR and GSIB more thoughtfully on how they think about pricing and we’re trying to sort of lean forward in pricing but it’s very competitive and we want to continue to be able to be there for our clients and the clients’ profitability is the ultimate measure of success and driving towards that 13 plus return is how we measure the ultimate segment. We are trying to do it and it is more successful.
As I said earlier, in those businesses where we’re finding people are commonly constraint and it is more competitive in areas where our best plan is having multiple options and it’s not a direct dollar for dollar, we have this capital, we have this liquidity ratio, we’re going to price it through but we are pushing forward with it.
Richard Ramsden
I’m sure one other question here.
Hi. Thanks, Marianne. The BIS issued the most recent study on the fundamental review of the trading book last week and week before and there are all kinds of problems with it. Can you bring us sort of up to speed on how you guys are thinking about it? And then there was specific language in there.
Can you assure us that JPMorgan -- your book maybe a little bit bigger but it’s not different in profile necessarily? Can you assure us that you guys are not in fact facing any sort of outsized increase in your marked RWS as a result of what the BIS is contemplating? Thanks.
Marianne Lake
Relatively speaking, so look at the end of the day, the fundamental trading book is a complicated one. As you know, the rules have been evolving reasonably significantly. There have been 4QISs and there is reasonably widespread understanding that -- well, I think a belief anyway that there needs to be some recalibration in the final rule. We await to see how that looks. And that based upon the market wide sort of impacts those could have on market rate capital and I can tell you that -- are you talking about the fact that there was an outlier output in the article.
I can tell you that wasn’t us, but that’s all relative. So across the board it could lead at currently written to pretty significant increases in market risk RWA. It’s our believe that was not the intention. There are ways to calibrate it. We have to, I think, be a little patient to see how that looks. I know some pressure for them to finalize rule.
I think the evidence for 4QIS shows we are willing to try and understand the issues and to try and figure out how to get to the right pace and the right pace as far as we understand it wasn’t contemplated to materially increase capital. So are we an outlier relative to our size of our book load but we are large and its complicated.
Richard Ramsden
We have one more question here as well.
Yeah. Thank you. There’s been a lot of commentary and presentations around Chase pay. And clearly you‘re unique in that you are large acquirer and a large issuer as well. So if you take the narrative around Chase Bank, it looks like a price cut, very simplistically. So can you help us understand how your ambitions there with things like ChaseNet and Chase Pay fit more broadly into your card business taking into account issuing balance sheet. How that will help you grow revenues and profits in the run?
Marianne Lake
Yeah. Okay. so I think, look, really just quickly to start on Chase Pay, we have a multiple strategy where we want to partner with industry leading digital wallets and we want our customers to have choice to have that cards in wallet and use it how they want. But we have a proprietary Chase Pay wallet that is differentiated. And so far as we spent over eight years building out the set of assets that allow us to bring together the customer experience, the margin experience.
Our deal with this are on ChaseNet and our largest wholly owned margin acquirer are large 94 million accounts that we have in our credit and debit issuing space. So at the end of the day, we have very significant unique assets we have spent a long time building out. And we are willing to take a more bundles, look at how we think about our ecosystem, all the way from the customer through to the merchant.
So for the merchant, the value is in more predictable lower cost of payments and ease of integration and for the consumer, it’s simple, it’s secure. We integrate the reward and our belief is very firmly that because the value is there for both parties that it will drive ultimately growth and value for our business in the card space. But the beauty is being able to look across and transcend just the issuing part of our business and look across the whole space, look at the bundled overall impact.
And certainly, it’s very -- we think offensive not just defensive. And we think that its anti-defensive that could drive significant value and growth overtime. It’s not going to be a 2016, ‘17 material driver, but I think it’s a material differentiator.
Richard Ramsden
I think we have time for one more. I think we have one here. Thank you. If we get mic on this side of the room.
Thanks very much, Marianne. Just a quick question, when you look at the big bang shaking more is a good example, you guys kind of benchmarking the space. You guys haven’t grown earnings for three years, a lot of it’s been due to shrinking balance sheet, things that you have to get regulatory rate? What’s going to be the single biggest thing that’s going to drive actual earnings growth next year in ‘17?
Marianne Lake
Next year, look, I think, if I’m realistic in 2016, the single big thing that is going to drive earnings growth is going to be the rate environment, that doesn’t undermined all of the other work we’re doing. If I talk about 2016 just for a second, because I think it might be instructive. If you assume that the market implied curve is central case or good base case of interest rate, it will drive our NII up together with the strong loan growth we’re expecting and the mix of our balance sheet by $3 billion basically implied, it could be better than that.
But when you look at NII, the underline drivers -- the fundamental drivers of our businesses are very good and over the course of the next several years that will play out to be strong growth.
But in 2016 I think you are aware that there are headwinds. We renegotiated some fairly significant car deals. It was a very strategic thing to do fulfill good sound economics. But year-over-year their comparison is going to be an annualized decrease in NII in the car business associated with that impact together with the continuation of pressure in mortgage revenues, both production and servicing.
So the mortgage production environment, the overall market size next year is anticipated to be down, largely on the back of refi being down. There are -- everybody is going to be competitive, there is less to eat and so revenue margins are going to be under pressure and servicing are continues to decline. So there is some headwind on NII.
And then on expenses, we could spend much less, we could totally do that, and but it wouldn’t be the right answer for the long-term value of the company. We are delivering material expense efficiencies, we have outlined them to you, but we have very significant investment opportunity.
We can add hundreds of bankers. It will drive superior performance overtime. We can invest in acquiring the card customers, the retail deposit customers also valuable. We could change that decision and improve our earnings in one year, but it wouldn’t improve the long-term prospect. So from an adjusted expense perspective, we are delivering efficiencies in order to invest.
Credit will be benign. So credit is our friend, but it’s already very benign. So I think in 2016 to be honest with you, its going to be a little bit rate driven, but beyond that it’s all of the things that we have talked about.
Richard Ramsden
With that we’re out of time. Marianne, thank you so much for coming.
Marianne Lake
