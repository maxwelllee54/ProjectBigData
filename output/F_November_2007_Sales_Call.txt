Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for yourpatience and welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Call for November of 2007. Myname is Bill; I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time,all of our participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating aquestion-and-answer session towards the end of today's presentation. (OperatorInstructions).
As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded forreplay purposes. I would now like to transfer the conference over to your hostfor today's presentation, Mr. George Pipas, U.S. Sales Analyst. Please, proceedsir.
George Pipas
Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon everybody and welcome toFord's November sales conference call. Joining me today is Emily KolinskiMorris, Ford's U.S. Senior Economist. As usual, Emily will provide you withinsights about the economy and be available to answer questions once we startthe Q&A segment.
First I want to offer this preamble. We, not just at Ford,but all of us are operating at a challenging and uncertain businessenvironment. Most important thing we can do at Ford is to stay focused and stayreal. Stay focused has to do to with continuing to make progress against ourplan. At Ford we are encouraged by the progress we have made in quality, cost,team work and of course bringing new products and technologies to market thatresonate with consumers. Staying real has to do with not counting on some hoped-forimprovement in the economy or in consumer demand. As someone once told me, hopeis not a plan. We are going to continue to monitor consumer settlement, buyingattitudes and demand through a clear lens.
Emily, why don’t you take over now?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Okay. Thanks, George. That's an appropriate introduction. Ofcourse, as all business cycles, there are periods when the fundamentals need toadjust and we can see that today the economy is in the midst of such a softpatch. Food and energy prices are rising, home prices are declining andconsumer confidence is below its historical average.
Now, for most of this economic expansion that began now sixyears ago, consumers have been able to offset adverse development such ashigher energy prices with what has been an extended period of job and incomegrowth.
Today, while job growth is still in excess of 1% and realincomes are growing at a 3% pace year-on-year, other head winds are rising. Asa result, vehicle sales have softened over the last few months. We believe thisreflects concerns about the credit and stock market squeeze along with theongoing adjustments consumers are making in response to housing and gasolineprice conditions.
So with an economy in transition such as this, we have tobalance our outlook across a range of competing signals. The six months movingaverage of vehicle sales has trended down to the low 16 million unit range inrecent months, that includes medium and heavy trucks with particular weaknesson the retail demand side of the industry.
Clearly, we are concerned about the credit market turmoiland the softer economy, so we are taking a cautious approach to planning ourbusiness. We are focused primarily on ensuring that our production is alignedwith demand and we'll continue to monitor this closely as we go forward.
George Pipas
Thank you, Emily. Now, for the sales: as you can see, Ford'sNovember sales were slightly higher than year ago. Total company sales, includingJaguar, Land Rover and Volvo were up four tenths of a percent compared withlast year. Sales for Ford's domestic brands: Ford, Lincoln and Mercury were up1%. If you sort our products into familiar categories you will see familiarthemes.
Crossover utility vehicles are growing. It's true at Fordand it's true for the industry, where crossovers have been, are and willcontinue to be the fastest growing category. Through October, industry sales ofcrossovers were up 17%. Our crossover growth has been stronger than theindustry growth in 2007, owing to the fact that we have two all new and threeredesigned models.
In November, combined sales of our crossovers were up 119%and year-to-date sales were up 63%. Also worth noting, is that full year Edgesales will likely exceed our revised target of 120,000 because through NovemberEdge sales are little over 116,000 units. I just want to share with you alittle anecdote and of course, it's a positive one, but I think that itrepresents a feeling we have about our entire product line up.
This comes from a blog site, I am not even sure which onebut it was sent to me by none other than Jim Kane. So you can imagine it’sgoing to be a positive one. This has to do with a customer who went on a blogafter he traded competitive foreign midsize sedan, one that's pretty well knownfor our Ford Edge Limited complete with Microsoft Sync and he wrote, "Ihave to say that I am in love with my ride. Yeah, you are not surprised but Iam. You are not more surprised than I with this assertion." I will tellyou what when I turned my back on American cars in 2004 I planned on that beinga permanent decision.
As many of you know, I have been looking at crossoverutility vehicles for months. I have dickered with sales folks at BMW, Volvo,Infiniti and Lexus, entertain the notion of a new Dodge, Buick, or even Lincolnoffering. It’s quite a lengthy blog, the person likes to write, but he closeswith anyone in the market for a mini van or SUV should consider the Ford Edge.I dare say that you will be a believer in the vehicle, especially, if you aretechno-hound who wants a car as smart as the phone.
Another thing that we've been seeing in recent months is Lincoln retail sales werehigher for the 14th month in a row. Total sales, which were shown on the salesreport, were down, owing to lower fleet sales from the Town Car. We have beenout of production for several months, in fact since we closed the Wixom plant.We will restart Town Car production soon at St. Thomas shortly after the first of theyear and that's where we built the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis.
We saw higher retail and total sales for the Ford Focus aswell as the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. As you all know, the Ford Focus wasredesigned for 2008 and November was its first four month on sales. Ford Focuscompetes in the small car segment and Fusion and Milan are in the mid-size segment. These twosegments have been growing this year and that was true in stage in November.
If you look at industry-wide retail sales in November andcompare that to October or last November, you would be struck by the shift tosmall cars, mid-size cars and crossovers. And you would be struck equally asmuch, by the shift away from trucks and truck-based sport utility vehicles. Andyou can certainly see examples of that in our sales report.
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about SYNC before Iconclude with some housecleaning items. I am going to be honest with you. Thoseof you who know me would guess that I am not your target SYNC customer. Atleast, they don't think I am. But I do want to share a few observations aboutthis product which is available on 12 Ford, Lincoln, Mercury products.
First, SYNC products are turning faster than non-SYNCequipped models. For example, on the new Focus, the overall turn rate is 25days, which is pretty good. But the SYNC equipped model is turning in 21. Andif you look at the turn rates for these 12 models on which SYNC is available,the turn rate in November was 52. When these models are SYNC equipped, the turnrate is 27.
Second, customer satisfaction is pretty high. We conductpost-purchase interviews on almost everything. 80% of new owners who purchasedthe vehicle with SYNC say that the product SYNC exceeds or greatly exceeds theirexpectations of the product. I am guessing they had pretty high expectations tobegin with otherwise they wouldn't have messed with that thing.
Third, SYNC appears to be changing for the better opinionsabout Ford and consideration for our products. Recently, we had a productdisplay at the Miramar Auto Show in San Diego. And most of the vehicles there were equippedwith SYNC. This was just one of several SYNC-owned tour events around thenation and 66% of consumers who visited our display at Miramar said SYNC improved their opinion ofFord and 57% say they were more likely to buy a Ford after learning about SYNC.
Now for sure we've had displays like the one at Miramar long before we hadSYNC, and we gathered statistics. Generally, when people get behind the wheelof the Ford product, 40% of the visitors to that display say they have animproved opinion about Ford. But at the Miramar Show, 66% did and that's whenwe exposed them to SYNC. 30% at a product show or product display at some eventwe hold, 30% say there are more likely to buy our Ford product. But as Iindicated at Miramar,it was 57%. So bottom line, SYNC appears to be, and I think that's what weshould say at this point, elevating consumer opinion about Ford and purchaseconsideration.
As we have said before, this is one of our greatestchallenges. We believe we have the products and the quality to stand up to thebest of the best. Our challenge is to elevate awareness, opinion andconsideration for our product.
Just a note on production, I think that our Q1 productionplan down 7% from last year's first quarter actuals, last year meaning, firstquarter 2007, is consistent with our outlook for consumer demand during thisnear-term period.
Inventories; 589,000 vehicles were in stock at the end ofNovember. This includes units that are in transit. As I've indicated inprevious calls, that's up from October's 564,000 units, but down from a yearago, when we reported 628,000 units in inventory at the end of November. Weclose by saying that we expect yearend 2007 inventories to be below yearend2006 inventories and understandably so, given our reduced sales forecast on anindustry-wide basis. Incidentally, for those inventories, 589,000, 183,000 werecars and 406,000 were truck.
Let's get underneath the skin of the November salesvariance. Let's have a level set here. Earlier, I said Ford and Lincoln Mercurysales were up 1%. Retail sales were close to a year ago. They fell short by4,000 units. That's 3%.
Total fleet sales were up this month, for the first month ina long time. They were up 12% and that has two pieces. The daily rental volumewas down 1,000 units, 6% from a year ago. Commercial and government fleet saleswere up 25%. It's a big variance in percentage terms. In volume, it means 7,000units.
So, what we have is retail, down 4,000 units; daily rental,down 1,000 units and then total fleet volume, up 6,000 units or 12% with the7,000 unit increase in commercial and government fleet sales.
Our fleet mix in November was 32% compared with 28% lastNovember. Year-to-date, our fleet mix is 30% compared with 33% in the first 11months of the year ago. Year-to-date, we've reduced daily rental volume by143,000 units compared with last year and our share of the daily rental marketis 16%.
A couple of notes on what we know about the industry at thispoint, to give you some indication of where November industry sales might endup. It would appear that total industry volume the SAARwould be about $16.0 million and let's pick the light vehicle sales rate at$15.7 million for the month. Industry sales would probably be 4% lower thanyear ago in November. That's consistent with discussion that Emily wasoffering, trending lower as we gone through the year.
Probably, the retail volume for the month industry-wide isdown more than the total 4% variance. We think that probably retail volume wasdown 7% compared with last November and that fleet volume industry-wide wasabout flat. We'll know more as we go through the month but that gives you someindication as to where the retail consumer was this month.
Now, Bill, let's get started on the Q&A. We have covereda lot of territory and I am looking forward to talking to people in the nexthalf hour about what's going on out there. Okay. Thank you for starting theQ&A session.
Question-and-AnswerSession
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions)
And our first question comes from the line of John Murphy ofMerrill Lynch. Please proceed.
John Murphy - MerrillLynch
Hi, George, how are you?
George Pipas
Hi, John.
John Murphy - MerrillLynch
A question on pricing and what you are seeing out there inthe market right now because you had a really good third quarter on net pricein North America. I am just trying to figureout if that has continued here? It seems like you've stepped up incentivespending on '07 miles, but maybe not on '08. It also sounds like you are takingpretty good price in fleet market, both rental and commercial. I was justwondering if you could give us some color around all those aspects.
George Pipas
Well, not a lot of specifics, except to say that clearly, Ithink it's always best to let the financial results, which you've seen inreally, not just Q3 but Q2 and if I can remember back as far as Q1, that hasbeen a positive for us as we progress through this year, consistent with ourplan.
I think Emily has offered in the past that -- well, all thatEmily offered to the comment about net vehicle pricing, Emily that we see inthe government data, but with regard to November, I would just offer that itseemed to us in looking at the data, that incentive spending was generallylower than it was a year ago in November and generally lower than it was inOctober too. But Emily, I want you to offer the comment about what we're seeingin the data.
Emily Kolinski Morris
Well, unfortunately, the government data, we're stilllooking at third quarter at this point as well (technical difficulty) Novemberreading by another couple of weeks. But the trend over the course of the yearhas been relatively flat. So, I don’t think we've seen any significant shift,at least in the first month of this quarter. And I can't really comment on whatmight have happened in November as far as that statistic. But I think theanecdotes we are getting are better (technical difficulty).
George Pipas
Yes and so, I think the general comment is that on balance,the OEMs have been pretty disciplined in their production planning and this flowsthrough the pricing. Interestingly, I think Emily, the observation from thelatest few events survey is that there are only about two months in the last 15years in which vehicle buying attitudes were lower than they were presently andone of the reasons sighted is the lack of generous deals, the lack ofcompelling deal. So, that is probably contributing to the softness and slowingin industry sales that we have been seeing. Okay, next question Bill?
Operator
Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, next questioncomes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed.
Rod Lache - DeutscheBank Securities
Good afternoon.
George Pipas
Hi Rod.
Rod Lache - DeutscheBank Securities
Couple of questions, first Emily we've seen vehicle demandin the past few months low 16's and this month 15.7. Can you just update us onyour expectations for light vehicle demand in ’08? What kind of trajectorywould you expect? Do you think things weakened from here and then come back inthe back half or just any thoughts on that?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Okay, I will give you from a directional insight on that. Asalways, we are going to be providing a milestone for a full year 2008 vehiclesales in January. But for now, what I can tell you is that in the next sixmonths, say we expect sales in a range of 15.5 to 16 million units on totalindustry, so you could say that by 300,000 for medium and highly truck sales.
The other point I would like to mention though is that, aswe look at this month or any other months result, we should keep in mind thefluctuations in month-to-month vehicles sales can be very large and in facthistorically are larger than the 500,000 unit range on the guidance that I justprovided to you. So, I always want to be careful not to read too much into anyone month, as of course by early six month, make sure close to six monthssomething average for all the units. So, we have a little bit of a clearerpicture of where the trend is as apposed to reading a lot into a single monthlybase.
Rod Lache - DeutscheBank Securities
Okay and then secondly, some clear strength here in thecommercial and government. Is it commercial or is it government? For theoverall market, if you look at 2008, what's your outlook for fleet?
George Pipas
Well, I guess I will address myself to Ford. Some of thestrengths, at least the magnitude of the strength in November, Rod, I don'tread that as, we have the beginning here of a rebound in commercial andgovernment fleet purchases. The commercial and government segment has held upbetter for the industry and for Ford for sure, than what we've experienced inthe daily rental, because in 2007 our daily rental sales are down more than 30%from a year ago and we’ve lost quite a bit of share in the daily rental marketto other competitors.
In the commercial sector and the government sector, saleshave been down in 2007 in the low single-digit range and in those categories. We'vegained share in the commercial fleet market and we have lost share in thegovernment market largely, as a result of the discontinued Taurus, that’s thesingle product that's stands out.
I think for next year, I have indicated that we plan tocontinue our not meltdown but that's a poor choice of words. We plan tocontinue our reduction in the daily rental business next year. I think that,our expectations are that the commercial and government business will hold uppretty well, but may not match this year's levels similar to what weexperienced in 2007, perhaps a modest decline owing to the slowing economy, sothat's what I have to offer on that at this point.
Rod Lache - DeutscheBank Securities
Okay. Can you share any thoughts on where you thinkinventories need to come down to just given your -- it sounds like somewhatdownwardly revised sales expectation?
George Pipas
Well, I think you could expect us to generally keepinventories at or below last year's level as we progress through the end of theyear and into next year. So, our sales -- our production decline of 7% isbasically spot on with what we think will be an industry decline of about thatmagnitude in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of '07.
Rod Lache - DeutscheBank Securities
Okay, great. Thank you.
George Pipas
Okay, Rod. Next question Bill?
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold of BearStearns. Please proceed.
George Pipas
Hi, Peter.
Peter Nesvold - BearStearns
Hi, George. Emily, question for you. This last month youtalked a little bit about how retail sales might be declining in '08 versus'07, and then now, with at least for the first half of '08 looking at latevehicle start 15.2 to 15.7. It seems like a pretty big jump in your internalforecast and I am curious, was it the consumer sentiment data or was itanything else that led to a meaningful change?
Emily Kolinski Morris
No, I don't think there was any. It's been pretty consistentas I said, with the trend that we have been seeing. As we look at the sixmonths moving average, moving down to now around 16 million, 16.1 millionunits, and we don't expect that to turnaround immediately obviously, given asyou mentioned the consumer settlement data and some of the other factors thatwe are seeing out in the market. So, I wouldn't say there's been any kind ofdramatic, there is no dramatic shift built into the outlook.
George Pipas
At this point, I would just want to clarify for everybodyPeter, you having raised the question is or following up on Rod's question, isthat make sure that you all don't interpret Emily's remarks as our 2008 fullyear forecast.
Right now, we are focused on the year end now in developingour operating plan. And so, what she has provided you, which is something wetypically wouldn't do at this point. But, we feel like it's important, is inthe near-term, in the next three to six months, we expect light vehicles salesto operate within a range, the simple tendency, if you will, is probably in therange of 15.2 to 15.7, and total vehicle sales that would be like 15.5 to 16.0.
And we'll give more consideration to the second half at thistime, so why not talk about the second half. Not only is this a particularlychallenging environment, but as I said earlier, it's also one that continuing afairly high level of uncertainty. So, we would just want to stay away fromsecond half at this point. Thanks guys. And next question Bill.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Jairam Nathan of Bancof America. Please proceed.
George Pipas
Hi.
Joe - Banc of America
Hi, this is actually Joe for Jairam.
George Pipas
Okay. Hi, Joe.
Joe - Banc of America
Hi. I have just two things. One, you had mentioned, I thinklast month that on daily rental, one month would be up, one month would bedown, but net it would be fairly even. So, I am assuming next month, we shouldstill see a large decrease in daily rental?
George Pipas
No, I think a month ago what I said Joe, was that Novemberand December daily rental would probably be comparable to taken together, thosetwo months taken together would be similar to a year ago. And so, we were downa little bit in November compared with the year ago.
And I think you could conclude that as I said last monththat we would be up a little bit in December. Neither month is at anearthshaking variance and one that tilts the scale either way. But I think thatdaily rental will be up a little bit in November, but that we will for the fullyear, had still gone beyond the initial guidance that I gave you back inJanuary, We're on a pass to reduce daily rental sales by about a 140,000,142,000 units for the year compared with the initial guidance of 135,000.
Joe - Banc of America
Okay.
George Pipas
Okay.
Joe - Banc of America
Yeah. Can you give us a sense then, as to where some of thenewer daily rental units are going or like what percent of Edge for instance isdaily rental?
George Pipas
Yes. Well, for our new products, we have at least the Fordbrand products. We have as part of our go-to-market strategy to place about 15%of what we expect our total volume to be into the daily rental market. Sothat's through a Focus, it was through a Fusion, it was through a Edge.
And our feeling is based on some analytical, based on someresearch with consumers who rent is that we get a lift in consideration frompeople that get behind the wheel of the products, very similar to what I wasdescribing at that auto display at the Miramar Auto Show.
So, that's an important aspect of our go-to-market strategy,and basically, we tap it at that level. So asking specifically about the Edgefor the full year, about 15% and you can expect that when we do the Flex in themiddle of next year, that that will be an important part of our go-to-marketstrategy to get that product on the road, people behind the wheel and help uselevate consideration of our product. Next question, Bill?
Operator
Next question sir comes from the line of Rob Hinchliffe ofUBS. Please proceed.
George Pipas
Hi, Rob.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBSSecurities
Hi. I wonder if you can talk about the S Series, theenvironment that you are talking about for the next six months. It's been whathad a few bad months in a row now. Does it get truly worse in the kind ofenvironment you are talking about?
George Pipas
Well, obviously, when we come into the first part of 2008Rob, we are coming up on the anniversary of some issues in the housing market.So, I think that next year's performance for example, should show up betteryear-over-year and I'm talking about the period prior to the F-150 introductionat the end of the year, because I don't know what the economic environment isgoing to look like at that time.
But in the next few months, I wouldn't expect the variancesto be as sharp as they have been during the course of 2007 because we are blisteringon this tough business environment.
Having said that, we can certainly see in the data thatafter the last few months when the industry seemed to be benefiting from veryhigh levels of incentives, volume was pulled into that period and full sizemarket didn't do too badly in August, September and October during thoseclearance programs.
But now, even with the yearend clearance programs, themarket is very tough out there in this category and not even year-endingclearance programs are really shifting the volume in this segment, eithercompared with October or compared with the year ago. So, it's going to betough.
Rob Hinchliffe - UBSSecurities
Can you talk to us about that the first quarter productionschedule? Is the F-Series production disproportionately down versus the 7%total decline?
George Pipas
No, I won't talk about F-Series in particular or any productin particular, but I will tell you that the 7% decline is basically, prettyevenly distributed between car, truck and total. Our current production in that685,000 unit forecast for Q1'08 is 195. The truck production is 490. That's thetotal of 685.
Last year, it was 207 in the first quarter of -- I'd say,last year first quarter of '07, was 207 car, 533 truck and 740 in total. So,that's a 6%, 8% and 7% decline for car, truck and total respectively. Okay.Next question, Bill?

Next question comes from the line of Robert Barry fromGoldman Sachs. Please proceed.
George Pipas
Hi, Robert.
Robert Barry -Goldman Sachs
Hi, George. Good afternoon.
George Pipas
Good afternoon.
Robert Barry -Goldman Sachs
I was wondering if you were seeing any increase inconservatives and then, the level of inventory dealers are willing to hold aswe head into a more uncertain macro environment.
George Pipas
Well, I think we all are. They are businessmen too and someof them are pretty big businessmen, representing several stores under publicownership. I don't know, but any more conservatism, for example, than we have,they know what's going on in their market and it probably does vary a littlebit by geographic region.
But, I personally, characterize the relationship betweendealers and manufacturers as the one that is much more of a partnership, thanit might have been, let's say, 30 years ago. There was an old saying that azone manager shouldn't come back to the office until they had completed theirwholesale and completed 100% of it.
And the standing joke was, is that the reason we putheadlights on cars in the first place was because the zone manager usually haveto comeback late at night after they had completed their wholesale. That's notreally the case. It's more of a business planning discussion. And so, we areall really aware of what's going on in each individual market.
Bill, I'd like to turn to the members of the automotivejournalists that are in our audience today and if you could facilitate that forme, I'd appreciate it.
Operator
Certainly, our first question will come from the line of JimHenry of BusinessWeek.com. Please proceed.
Jim Henry - BusinessWeek.com
Hi, George.
George Pipas
Yes.
Jim Henry - BusinessWeek.com
My first question has been asked and answered about whetheryour short-term expectations for sales, but I also wanted to ask about themodel, your mix, between '07 and '08?
George Pipas
Sure.
Jim Henry - BusinessWeek.com
That tells me, and this has come up in earlier month, thatthe switch from the '07 to '08 went better than it has done in a few years. Butyou know better than I and maybe you could put some numbers on that?
George Pipas
Sure. From a stock standpoint, Jim, at the end of November,only 13% of the 589,000 units that are in stock are the older model. So, youcan translate that to be 87% are new models. The sales mix in the month ofNovember was 77% new and 23% old. Next question, Bill?

Next question comes from the line of Mike Spector of theWall Street Journal. Please proceed.
Mike Spector - WallStreet Journal
Hi, George.
George Pipas
Hi, Mike.
Mike Spector - WallStreet Journal
I have a general question about the shift in the sales mixgenerally with SUVs and CUVs. I am curious if you can give us a little color onthe margins on those vehicles. How the margins on the crossover is comparedwith the larger SUVs and how that maybe affecting the business going forward,as you have to drive down continued decline in SUVs and increase in CUVs?
George Pipas
No, I think there are plenty of analysts out there that willgive you all the color you want. I don'tknow that Ford or anybody else has provided anything in the way of specificguidance. We all know that the marginson smaller products are not as big as their own bigger products. And I thinkthat's true. I think a 1,500 square foot home doesn't have the margins that a4,500 square foot home does. So, yes, that's all that I am going to say aboutthat.
Mike Spector - WallStreet Journal

Yes, hi John. Good to hear from you. John, are you there?Can we switch it Bill?

Up there you go, Mr. Welbes your line should be open now.

John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Hi, George.
George Pipas
Yes.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Hey, I know that your Rangers are a small piece of yourbusiness but you are keeping around another year. Can you tell me what's that includingto your fleet sale performance?
George Pipas
Not materially.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Alright and where did the inventory stand and Ranger comparedto unit sales?
George Pipas
I would have to look at last months inventories because Idon’t pull the inventories by product line until the day after.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Okay.
George Pipas
And then that's issued through the trade journals.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
And in these results we're looking at, are Canadian salesincluded in these?
George Pipas
Interesting question, I've seen this in a couple of researchnote recently, to extent that, well, what did you mean by that first of all?
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Sales of Rangers are north of the border.
George Pipas
Okay. That’s what I thought you meant. To the extent thatthere are any, not only for Ranger, but for any product, if a U.S. dealer sells the product, it’s included inthe U.S.dealers sales report and I really don’t know what the extent of that is. It'ssomewhat limited although I don’t want to diminish the issue for a dealer whohappens to be close to the border. But it's somewhat limited by the fact that-- on a national scale it's somewhat limited by the fact that there aren't allthat many big cities or big areas close to the border are they.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Right, okay.
George Pipas
I think that’s true in Minnesota.
John Welbes - St. Paul Pioneer Press
Yeah, that’s true. We'll keep hearing that if we are sellingrelatively well, and it's using it relatively in Canada compared to a domestically.But…
George Pipas
Well there aren’t that many Ranger sales to begin with, are there?

Eric Morath - The Detroit News
Hi, George can you talk a little bit more- you mentioned in senseof the big trucks. Can you add afterwards what are the incentives looking likeon them?
George Pipas
You have to talk to Jim Kane. I don’t know what the currentlevel of incentive programs are although, I just watch the TV, right. And Iknow that incentives on full size trucks industry wide, it’s certainly one ofthe highest segments in all the industry with the possible exception of some ofthe luxury segments where leasing and well mostly leasing incentives tends togenerate high levels of per unit spending on those high priced products. Okay.But apart from that the specifics could be made available by Jim or Lydia Cisarukat Ford, or Link of Mercury.
Eric Morath - The Detroit News
Alright, thank you.
George Pipas
Okay, next question.
Operator
Actually we do not have any other questions from the mediaat this time.
George Pipas
Okay any more questions from the analyst Joe?
Operator
Yeah, we do have a question from Joe [Dorm] of CreditSuisse.
Joe Dorm - CreditSuisse
George, you already answered me.
George Pipas
Okay. Any other questions Bill in the queue.
Operator
Yes, actually, we do have a question from the line of BrianJohnson.
George Pipas
Hi, Brian.
Operator
I’ll prolong. Let me just get his line for you.
George Pipas
Okay. Brian, are you there?
Operator
No, he is coming on hold on once, I’ll inform you, George.
George Pipas
Okay.
Operator
And there is Mr. Johnson from Lehman Brothers
Brian Johnson -Lehman Brothers
Good afternoon, George.
George Pipas
Hi, Brian.
Brian Johnson -Lehman Brothers
Within your economic forecast and within your production,where did you see Super Duty going and I asked because CSM had a lot ofdowntime for Kentucky Truck schedule and then they backed it off and we aretrying to interpret what's really going on with that product line?
George Pipas
I think as a guide, you can continue to use 40% ofproduction and sales over any extended period of time. Super Duty salesrepresented they were actually over 41% this month, but 40% is kind of a monthend, month all level that you can use to calibrate yourself there, and I thinkthat will be true going forward probably as well.
Brian Johnson -Lehman Brothers
And how does within the 150 line inventory look on the SuperDuty versus the 150?
George Pipas
Again, I don't know. And in any indication and in any way,that's not something we provide to the trade journals on a recurring basis.
Brian Johnson -Lehman Brothers
Okay, thanks.
George Pipas
Okay. Next question Bill, if there is one.
Operator
Yeah, we actually have a couple from the media. We have onefrom Greg Bensinger of Bloomberg News. Please proceed.
Greg Bensinger -Bloomberg News
Hello.
George Pipas
I am still anxious too and I am just interrupting Bill rightand left. I got to behave myself here. Yeah, are you still there, Greg?
Greg Bensinger -Bloomberg News
Yeah, can you hear me?
George Pipas
Yes, I can.
Greg Bensinger -Bloomberg News
If you have to point one or two factors that accounted forthe gain this month, what would you say they were and is that repeatable incoming months for Ford?
George Pipas
Well --
Greg Bensinger -Bloomberg News
Is it just crossovers or…?
George Pipas
Well, I think it depends on how you look at the business,right? If you look at it by product line, you could say crossovers, but wait aminute, crossovers have been strong all year along. The biggest differencebetween this month's report and the report of the last 10 months or some peoplehave said 12 months, 12 months in a row declines.
But just focusing in on 2007 Greg, the biggest difference isthat in the previous 10 months, our daily rental declines were 20%, 30%, 40%,sometimes over 60% lower than a year ago and consistent with what I indicatedin previous months, that we would have completed the lion share of our dailyrental reductions by the end of October and that corresponded with the end ofproduction of the Taurus at the end of last October.
So if you go back, Bill, to just this past October, I can'tremember exactly but I think the Taurus volume was 15,000 to 20,000 units, okay,in October of '06 and this year, there was none. But in November of last year,there were only 5000 Taurus. So we have now anniversaried on the end ofproduction of that product and while we are going to continue to reduce dailyrental volume in 2008 calendar year, the reductions are not going to be of themagnitude that they were when we discontinued the Taurus product.
And that's basically it, yet the retail volume was prettyclose to a year ago. The commercial and government volume was up but not by abig. It was a nice big percentage, but it wasn't much. It wasn't huge, althoughI am happy to have a huge chunk of volume. The biggest difference between nowand the last 12 months has to do with the end of Taurus production and all thatvolume going away in each of the last 12 months. Okay?
Bill, you said there is another question.
Operator
We do have another question from Neal Boudette of the WallStreet Journal. Please proceed.
George Pipas
Yes, hi, Neil.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Hi, George, how are you today?
George Pipas
Good.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
I wonder if you could elaborate on this production number inthe first quarter. It looks to me to be down by about 7%. Can you elaborate andwhat the thinking is there? Some of that is fairly obvious, but --?
George Pipas
It's easy. That's an easy question. In fact, it's a softball. It's exactly consistent. Well, it might be off by two or three-tenth of apercent, but it's exactly consistent with our view about where industry salesare going to be compared with a year ago. So, we feel our inventories arepretty well set, okay, where we are right now, in general terms.
And we feel like our sales are going to hold up wellrelative to the rest of the industry. So, if we just cut right through it ourproduction decline in the first quarter is consistent with our view about theindustry outlook in the near term. And that end, obviously, there is a level ofuncertainty in there but that's at this point, where we are calling it.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Of this cuts, where do they predominantly fall? It's in thetruck segment or the car segment?
George Pipas
Someone asked earlier about car and truck and I indicatedthat car production in the first quarter is down 6%, truck production is down8%, and the total is down 7%. So, there is very little difference between onecategory and another.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Is the F-150 factored into that?
George Pipas
Yes.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Or is this the opening line.
George Pipas
You're talking about the new F-150? Well, the newest F-150doesn’t begin production until sometime in the second half of the year.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
That’s what I thought. That's what I wanted to check to seeif you are talking about old F-150 production, if that’s reflective of the lastfew months of production of the old model.
George Pipas
Well, yes. I mean F-150 is in there and it’s such a big partof our volume, total production couldn’t be down by 8% on the truck sidewithout some reduction in F-150, F Super Duty and who knows what else that goesinto the truck categories, Ford utilities, etc.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
But is the F-150 going out of --?
George Pipas
No. It doesn’t go out of production until the summer, ifthat’s what you mean.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Okay. But that 8% reduction in truck production, that’sfully the result of where you expect the market to be?
George Pipas
Yes. It doesn’t have anything to do with the launch of thenew product. It's much too early to be factoring that into the equation withregard to a specific changeover. The changeover won't occur probably until thethird quarter.
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
Okay.
George Pipas
Okay?
Neal Boudette - WallStreet Journal
All right, thanks a lot.
George Pipas
Okay, Neil. Bill, I think that wraps it up. I really doappreciate: A, all the participation; B, the level of interest in thediscussion. And we look forward to talking to you in the near future.
