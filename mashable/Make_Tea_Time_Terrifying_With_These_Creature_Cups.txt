Make Tea Time Terrifying With These Creature Cups
Cream and sugar can only do so much. If you really want to liven up your next cup of coffee, beyond the traditional boundaries of lactose and artificial sweeteners, consider one of these mugs. 
They're called Creature Cups, and they're exactly what you'd hope they would be. Each mug is specially designed with a creepy surprise dwelling at the bottom: skulls, tarantulas, alligators and lobsters — the whole gang's there. 
Fill one to the brim, hand it to a friend and wait for the scream. Just be sure you're standing outside the spit zone.
