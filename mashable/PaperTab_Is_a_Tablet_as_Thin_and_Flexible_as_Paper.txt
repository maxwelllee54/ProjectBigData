PaperTab Is a Tablet as Thin and Flexible as Paper

Are tablets of today too fat and clunky for you? Meet PaperTab, a 10.7-inch tablet that's almost as thin — and flexible — as a sheet of paper. 
Developed by Plastic Logic, PaperTab has a flexible touchscreen that lets users send files and emails and navigate through pages of documents using hand gestures. One can also combine several PaperTabs into one larger surface by placing them side by side, or share files by touching one tablet to another. 
PaperTab is powered by an Intel i5 processor, which seems to be separate from the actual display and connected to the PaperTab with a thin data cable. We're unsure if this is the way the device is planned to work when finalized or it's just a prototype. We'll find out pretty soon, as Plastic Logic plans to reveal PaperTab to the press Tuesday at CES 2013. 
"Plastic Logic's flexible plastic displays are completely transformational in terms of product interaction. They allow a natural human interaction with electronic paper, being lighter, thinner and more robust compared with todayâ€™s standard glass-based displays," says Indro Mukerjee, CEO of Plastic Logic.
