Google Doodle in U.K. Celebrates 150th Anniversary of the London Underground
Web surfers in the U.K. were treated Wednesday morning to a Google Doodle celebrating the 150th anniversary of the London Underground, that city's subway transit system.
The Doodle uses the famous map to spell the letters of its name. According to The Independent, the lines and names of the stops are accurate. 
The Metropolitan Railway, as its known, opened on this day in 1863. The first journey took place between Paddington and Farringdon. At the time there were seven stations. Since then, 263 more stations have been added. Some 1.17 billion passenger rides took place across the system last year. The New York subway system delivered 1.64 billion rides in 2011
The oldest subway line in the U.S. started in 1897 in Boston. The New York subway system opened in 1904.
