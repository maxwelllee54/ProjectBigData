TV Shows and Movies With the Most-Engaged Fans on GetGlue
This week's mid-season premiere of The Big Bang Theory, a sitcom about a group awesomely geeky friends, roped in a record-breaking 19.25 million viewers. 
The show also tops the final 2012 scorecard (see infographic below) for scripted shows with the most activity — for live episodes and re-runs combined — on social entertainment platform GetGlue. Activity includes check-ins, likes, reviews and unlocking stickers.
For activity during episode premieres, fantasy drama Once Upon a Time reigned supreme in the rankings for scripted broadcast shows, while vampire drama True Blood had the most-active fans among scripted cable shows.
"We're always pleasantly surprised to see fan favorites such as Community, Fringe and Doctor Who ranking with ratings giants like Modern Family, True Blood and The Walking Dead," Kimber Myers, GetGlue's senior director of partnerships, tells Mashable.
"It demonstrates that GetGlue activity doesn't just reflect what's popular; it's also an indication of which shows have the most-engaged fan bases."
