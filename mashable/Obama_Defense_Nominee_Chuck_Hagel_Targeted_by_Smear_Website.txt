Obama Defense Nominee Chuck Hagel Targeted by Smear Website
Mere hours after President Barack Obama put forth Chuck Hagel as his choice for Secretary of Defense, a pro-Israel group launched a website with the goal of scuttling the nomination.

The website, ChuckHagel.com, was launched by the Emergency Committee for Israel, and claims that Hagel "is not a responsible option" for the cabinet position. 
The Emergency Committee for Israel is described on its website as "committed to mounting an active defense of the U.S.-Israel relationship by educating the public about the positions of political candidates on this important issue." The interest group, led by right-wing commentator and Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, has already posted an anti-Hagel video to YouTube that knocks his stance on economic sanctions and military action against Iran. 

Hagel, a former senator from Nebraska, has in previous comments said that military action against Iran would be ill-advised. He has been criticized by many conservatives and some liberals for those stances and for being, in their view, insufficiently supportive of Israel. 
The brewing controversy over Hagel's nomination is leading some analysts to expect less than smooth sailing when the Senate votes on his nomination.
The committee also plans to buy ad placements on Google that will appear when users search for "Chuck Hagel," according to Yahoo.
