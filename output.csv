(OTCPK:LNGLF) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call March 30, 2017 7:00 PM ET",RIO,Executives,Gregory Vesey - Managing Director and CEO,"Michael Reed Mott - CFO	Analysts	James Burn - Citi	Andrew Henderson - Private Investor	Greg Mitchell - Private Investor	Kyle Travis - Private Investor	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the LNG Ltd. investor presentation and market update. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions]	I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Greg Vesey, Managing Director and CEO of LNG Ltd. Thank you sir. Please go ahead.	Gregory Vesey	Thank you, operator. Well, good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone on the call and welcome to LNG Ltd.’s quarterly update conference call for our half year ended December 31, 2016. I will now be providing a prepared discussion on the presentation which was just recently posted to our website today, and as Christian said at the end of this you will have time for questions and answers.	So if you will, it is important, please follow along as I discuss the slide deck. If you don't have the deck or access to it at this time that is fine. The call is being recorded, and you can listen to me again along with the deck. Joining me on the call tonight is our CFO, Mike Mott, who was instrumental in pulling this presentation together and I would like to recognize the whole LNG Ltd. team for their work on this important presentation.	So throughout my comments I will keep you on track by indicating what slide I am referring to. So with that and to get started I am currently on Slide 2, which of course, is our legally required disclosure. So I won't read this to you. I will let you have it for your leisure to read.	Let us move onto Slide 3. Our half year results were filed with the ASX and if you are interested they are posted on our website. And the highlights so far include continuing success in managing our cash position, very consistent with our cash management plan. So as shareholders I know you want us focused on good cash management. We continue to do that.	In late November, early December we received our FERC order on hearing, which was issued fully reaffirming our authorization of the Magnolia LNG export facility. In addition, Magnolia LNG was approved for export of non-FTA export to other LNGs of the country, which gives us the whole world to sell LNG to at this point.	We also extended the validity of our lump sum turnkey EPC contract with the KSJV and we had an announcement of a non-binding HoA with vessel solutions, enabling VGS to market for us in the Indian market. In addition, we have had an increasing and deepening activity on the marketing front overall extending the prospects of our North American projects, particularly the Magnolia our most advanced project.	Maybe I will pause here for a second. I understand that some are concerned about our perceived delay in Magnolia LNG’s FERC notice to proceed process. I would like to touch on this briefly. I will remind you that our process to move to a final investment decision and financial close is based on factors other than the receipt of its FERC’s notice to proceed.	The FERC program, which governs the construction of our LNG projects require that engineering be 100% complete prior to initiation of construction itself. As you might guess this is impractical in practice with an integrated EPC schedule, so the FERC allows project proponents to segregate the construction into a number of individual work packages. So when engineering for work package is complete, the FERC will also have construction of the isolated package by issuing a notice to proceed for that specific work.	So in the case of Magnolia we have submitted our initial work package including all backup documentation, which is for initial site preparation. FERC has reviewed this information and after that review issued a data request for additional information as they see necessary. Our Magnolia team with the assistance of the KSJV is necessary to respond to these data requests on a priority basis.	We have generally avoided aggressively expediting FERC since again the FERC NTP is not the pacing item for financial close. We do however expect to receive our first NTP in the near future. Based on our monitoring of FERC dockets, it is clear the priority is given to projects already in construction, and consequently we are confident that FERC will strongly support Magnolia construction once we initiate this activity.	So overall [Indiscernible] the timing actually works in our favor better aligning with our progress on offtake. And I would make an important note here; none of our potential customers have brought up this as a concern. They were focused on the FERC final order and our DOE non-FTA approval. They view this as part of our primary business and are not bothered by this at all. So I want to give folks some comfort in that regard.	So now let us get on with the primary purpose of our call, which is to provide an update on the status of our business, our prospects going forward and our competitive advantages over our competition.	So I have moved onto Slide 4 now, which is our vision, mission and value strategy slide. Since joining LNG Ltd. last year, the team and I have reviewed our corporate goals and studied our strategic competitive advantages. We have assessed the challenges we face both within the LNG industry and on a more macro level, and how we are positioned in the marketplace.	With our conclusion, first of all, our legacy strategy remains viable and strong. Our geographically diverse portfolio represents a platform for expedited growth and our patented OSMR liquefaction technology is clearly a key competitive advantage. A combination of low-cost, low-risk constructionary status of Magnolia is not currently replicated by any other North American Greenfield project.	The market positioning of our company and our project marketing requires enhancements to realize the share price that remains currently undervalued by the market. For the vision, mission, values and strategy slides puts in the words a simple message that LNG Ltd. desires to be the world's premier provider of midscale LNG liquefaction solutions. And I personally am confident that our three step strategy and our execution will help us realize this vision.	On Slide 5, we see artist renditions of our three existing development projects as well as the picture of our floating liquefaction design. A quick synopsis of our company for those who are not familiar with us. We have three development projects in our portfolio, which represent up to 24 million tons of midscale liquefaction capacity. The Magnolia LNG project in the Gulf Coast region, just south of Lake Charles; the Bear Head LNG project off the coast of Nova Scotia in Canada; and our Fisherman’s Landing LNG on the east coast of Australia.	All three projects are in advanced development with Magnolia LNG being absolutely shovel ready. Our projects are technologically advantaged providing the lowest full cycle cost design in the industry. In summary, we are very well positioned for success.	On Slide 6, I'm very proud of Slide 6. Our Magnolia LNG project recently graced the cover the LNG industry magazine in January 2017. That was accompanied by a KBR advertisement that emphasized midscale technology design highlighting the Magnolia LNG project. The inclusion of our project in their advertisement reflects the strength of the alliance between us and our EPC partner.	The cover hails Magnolia LNG as the next US Gulf Coast project, which of course, you are all hearing. This statement is true because we know the advantages our projects have over the competition. However, we do recognize that there are a large number of developers each looking to advance their projects as well. Hence we feel it is time for us to showcase our competitive advantages and to make clear why we are so confident in our view that Magnolia LNG as well as our other portfolio projects are best positioned to close and move to construction and operation.	Slide 7 is very interesting. It gives some examples of what the competition has been saying both about us and about their projects. If you look at this slide, these narratives represent just a few statements gleaned from public documents, from company websites, from industry seminars and the like. As with any company in any industry, self-promotion is a requirement of any management team. However, we feel it is important to put all of this in a proper perspective.	I guess what I am saying here folks is that almost anything can be said on a PowerPoint slide. We'll take you through a full technology review as well as a full EPC review to help you understand the certainty we offer at Magnolia.	I will now move onto Slide 8. And if you take nothing else away from this presentation and please remember this, Magnolia LNG is the only US Greenfield project that offers prospective customers absolute certainty. No other developer is currently positioned to say that and in our view other projects are for off from achieving that important differentiating factor. So at a high level, all liquefaction development projects have similar cost elements. Liquefaction construction cost, site and waterway preparation, you have got feed gas access, you have got owner’s cost and of course, you have financing cost.	Depending on the nature of the technology selected and the strategy employed, developers have choices on which enterprise, lowest capital cost, highest production efficiency, or an optimal combination of the two. For us, we believe Magnolia LNG have struck the optimal balance across all these factors. And for all the reasons stated on this slide, our intent is to ensure that industry buyers fully appreciate the differences and company offerings and the inherent risks of negotiating with parties that do not offer Magnolia certainty of cost, certainty of design, certainty of permitting, and certainty of finance.	Moving to Slide 9, and again for a discussion on project costs. To begin with as I have said, Magnolia is a known entity. Our capital and operating strategies are very mature and all our key contracts are signed. There is no ambiguity or concern about the future events impacting buyer negotiations, impacting our cost, or impacting our price. Applying our strategic approach to selecting development sites, and utilizing the OSMR technology solutions Magnolia LNG optimizes the full cycle cost of LNG production through a low-cost, lump-sum, donkey EPC contract signed with the KBR and SKE&C joint venture, through operations in maintenance strategy focused on providing low cost, reliable and safe operations through an industry lowest retainage factor for projects using gas-fired turbines.	For folks that aren't familiar the retainage factor reflects the amount of inlet gas consumed in the process of making the LNG. The lower the retainage factor the more efficient and cost-effective the process. What this means is less gas is used to fuel the facility and goes directly into the production of LNG. This translates into considerable savings over the life of the contract, and Magnolia LNG’s industry leading well retainage factor in addition is guaranteed by our joint venture in our EPC contract.	Magnolia is naturally protected from storm surge as it resides above the 500 year flood point. It is adjacent to an existing industrial waterway with an existing turning basin, which was constructed by the Navy some years back. We have the Kindermorgan pipeline connected to the US natural gas pipeline grid, running directly underneath our site and providing access to gas supplies without the need to permanently construct costly dedicated lateral pipelines to provide feed gas.	And it is located in an industrial zone providing ready access to an employee base, and to the basic necessities around the site such as emergency care, first responders, chemicals, commercial laboratories and other similar services integral to the operation of a facility such as this.	You know, you have heard a lot about lowest-cost this [Indiscernible], our competitors speak about ranges of EPC cost that are yet to be determined using words such as target, expectation or approximation. Not only do these disclosures lack executed contracts in support of the claims they also fail to encapsulate the all in cost to construct. Depending on the project, significant incremental capital may be needed for flood protection, waterway dredging, pipeline construction, installed generation capacity and similar other costs required to ultimately produce LNG.	As you could guess, all of these costs require a return on capital employed that must be financed. What this means that these costs must be either passed through to LNG buyers and included in offtake pricing or they will result in lower returns to the developer and threaten the viability of achieving financial costs.	In putting together this presentation, we undertook an assessment of the competition and comparing their strengths and weaknesses to Magnolia LNG. And for the purposes here, Magnolia’s competitors include land-based, Greenfield export projects, including approved for construction and development projects in the permitting process.	The project considered for inclusion and the scope of this analysis were grouped by region as follows. South Texas, we looked at Annova, we looked at Texas LNG, we looked at Rio Grande, Port Arthur, and Corpus Christi and such. In Louisiana, we looked at SCT&E, we looked at G2, we looked at Driftwood, we looked at Calcasieu Pass, and we looked at Plaquemines Parish and others.	In this slide, the Louisiana 1 comparator in the presentation assumes the use of gas-fired turbines, whereas the Louisiana 2 instead assumes the use of inside-the-fence newly constructed combined cycle generation. On the West Coast, we looked at Woodfibre, we looked at Pacific Northwest, we looked at Oregon LNG, and we looked at Jordan Cove.	We are kind of backwards from the other one. The West Coast 1 comparator here assumes the use of inside-the-fence newly constructed combined cycle generation, whereas the West Coast 2 example assumes the use of gas-fired turbines. The final criterion for projects included in our analysis was based on availability of a robust set of technical data to underpin these various economic assessments.	The complimentary factor was consideration of a blend of technologies selected by competing projects to ensure that the comparison to Magnolia and our OSMR liquefaction process was robust. And where do we get the data? Data supporting the economic analysis was provided through or derived from project specific FERC filings available through the FERC website and through company press releases.	This data was then supplemented through publicly available industry analyst reports from such sources as Poten, WoodMac, financial analysts, and the like, as well as government reports from such sources as US energy information administration. And in addition, where applicable we validated the data against our own EPC and subcontractor experience. In addition, consideration of costs was made against in-operation or in-construction brownfield projects in the Gulf Coast region such as the Sabine Pass, Cameron, and Freeport.	So with that let us proceed to understanding and interpreting our findings. Slides 10 and 11 provide details of challenges and related cost implications concerning most competitor projects, and as you might guess these must be well understood prior to a final investment decision. I'm not going to go through these slides in detail because they are quite complex. So suffice to say that depending on a site’s location, depending on its land and waterway topography, depending on the technology selected and their approach to execution and other factors cause incremental to the headline EPC cost required to progress Greenfield projects through the operation can be and look to be extremely significant.	Let's move to slide 12. I touched on some of this already but let me highlight implications that arise from these less absolute with equally important aspects to overall cost to construct and operating LNG's port facility. As we stated Magnolia LNG is very well suited with respect to all of these risk considerations. Other projects due to re-movements of location, due to the land and water topography, due to strategic decisions made on execution approach and importantly lack of maturity in contracting for EPC in other CapEx contracts required to build the facility, introduce cost, timing, and reliability risk, during construction and into operation.	Each facility, as you might guess has unique challenges in these areas in the various management teams will recourse the drift be even new course unsure. However, and I want to reiterate this, Magnolia is share already, all of these factors are known. The risks are evaluated and priced and mitigation plans put in place. These are all considered in our current commercial offering.	Moving to slide 13. We know that construction of a new world class infrastructure project includes raw materials and labor cost as the major components of an overall cost structure. We focus on the recent downturn in the energy industry. Magnolia LNG actually negotiated with existing lump sum turnkey EPC contract with the KSJV at the bottom of the current cost cycle.	Admittedly, Magnolia LNG's contract is subject to revision before construction does not commence it in the current validity period. However the fact that Magnolia LNG has signed contracts in hand and pricing is at the low end of the current cost curve, represents a clear and favorable differentiation from all of other projects.	So, buyers we are looking for reliable and certain uptick pricing, to consider the potential for inflationary factors that could materially increase EPC cost and thus increase the level of uptick pricing required for developers to financially close their projects. With Magnolia, this risk can be completely mitigated by range to acquire our capacity now under our existing signed agreements.	Thanks, thank you for hanging in there, we're doing well. I'm on slide 14, where we just briefly address environmental factors. As we all know, the environment is a major challenge for global leaders today, which is one reason that LNG has been the preferred alternative by many to call another fossil fuel and its lead bridging fuel to a more environmentally friendly alternatives.	LNG might guess for many LNG buyers this is a very important aspect of who they do business with. What I liked about this slide is it provides comparison of Magnolia against its competitors in terms of air emissions and habitat impact. We're very proud to say that Magnolia LNG is extremely well positioned relative to its competitors in its environmental footprints.	Okay, we got slide 15 which is a very interesting slide and warrant this review. You know, we've seen recent disclosures by BP and Shell and others which provide expectations of market demand from new LNG liquid gas and capacity from now out through about 2025. What we’ve done for our purpose is that we've assumed the level of 90 million tons per annum of new unsanctioned global capacity that corresponds directly with these quartiles.	With new capacity, we'll come primarily with the cost of global course. However, if you think about the availability of low cost speed gas and the other pro-business environment in the US, there's an expectation that a large part of this new capacity maybe built in North America. So, for purposes of our slide, we split it down the middle, 50% here, 50% across the globe.	What we've done projects considered for our analysis varied in sized from 4 million tons per annum up almost 30 million tons for annum on design capacity. Let's think about the lower in size table in 10 million ton per annum. It's reasonable to expect projects to go under US market share from 10% to 20% of the sanction capacity expected to be built in the US. This is a whole logical type of ship.	However, the project with base plans having very large design capacities stay above the 10 million tons per annum, they need to capture our market share of as much as 60% of US new build capacity to complete the project as planned and designed which quite frankly is very aggressive. These projects fail to achieve as market share only build half of even three quarters of plan design capacity, where average cost for ton of liquefaction increases dramatically.	And in current disclosures of EPC cost headline numbers quoted by competitors may be exposed to market risk over and above risk typically facing infrastructure construction projects. The risk that uptick prices here renegotiation -- renegotiated where the project cannot financially close due to inability to achieve current market share aspirations is very real.	To look to the right, a further complicating matter for our competitors is the current capital natural gas exports imposed by the department of energy. Existing cap formats in none of LNG that maybe exported from the US to an equivalent of 20Bcf/day of natural gas. A total of 17.2Bcf/day of LNG exports have already been granted by the DoE which leaves only 2.8Bcf/day available under the current cap amounts to about 20 million tons per annum.	I'm sure that these projects will say the cap will be raised by the DoE, that there is absolutely no certainly that this will happen and if it does, to what level or how long this process could take. Since, Magnolia already has this DoE approval, it is not at risk if the DoE chooses not to raise this cap. Other price that we yet to receive has approval certain phases, cost this uncertainty.	Okay, slide 16. Thanks for hanging in there with us. Construction of export facilities requires front end loaded heavy capital expenditure due to the need to build share infrastructure to enable phase operations. So, what am I talking out here is that you're going to build an LNG facility, you got to have feed, you have time launch, you got to have loading launch, you got to have tanks, roads, command centers etcetera.	All of this have got to be expended upfront before we can produce the first drop of LNG. So, what this graphic portrays is the effect of dollar averaging on CapEx cost. If you look at the red dot, this represents the effect of only building one half of plan design capacity. While the green diamonds represent the per ton cost only three quarters of planned and line capacity as build.	The risk of material cost overruns for projects with very high design capacities which fail to achieve market share expectation is has been just very high. The mark-on effective that the surety of achieving financial close and moving to construction is undeniably more at risk. So, what we'll tell buyers of LNG is they should look beyond headline cost numbers to fully appreciate inherent risk and developers claims and what supports back up those claims.	On slide 17 we further illustrate how Magnolia is relative to its competition. This graphic shows the range of exposure buyers actually have in pricing aspiration made by less matured projects relative to the known primarily as Magnolia. It's clear that Magnolia LNG provides the least exposure to unexpected surprises and cost overrun and consequently uptick pricing with an equally high certainty that the project will financially close and move to construction in the timeline agreed to with LNG buyers based on our target uptick pricing.	So, move to slide 18. Let's address the regulatory process. Many competing projects out there has disclosed accelerated expectation to realizing their FERC order and the grant by the DoE of non-FTA approval. So, we had no better source than our won company history to look at here. What we found is our disclosures were overly optimistic considering the limited control as a developer we had over the regulatory process.	Developers influence is limited to the quality and timing of submissions we give to the regulators. We here found out the hard way that agencies and process has moved at their own pace. So, while we have a great relationship within and work strongly with them what we see right now the key takeaway is that regulatory time line appeared to be getting longer but not shorter.	Slide 19 is just to reminder you that the LNG Limited will be well represented at gas check including myself in Tokyo next week and we certainly invite all parties interested in LNG Limited, our development project and our assessment of our competitor advantages to physical represent important industry event and we look forward to seeing folks there.	Before we take questions I will go to the slide 20 and finally here Magnolia LNG is the only project that can support it's off take pricing with real and non-spec data. With that along with Mike I am happy to take questions from the audience and again I certainly appreciate your time going through this with us and while folks are looking to do that I do have some other shareholder questions that is coming, so I will answer that while we’re waiting but certainly want to go with the phone lines first for any questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you very much. [Operator Instruction] Your first question today comes from the line of James Burn from Citi. Please go ahead.	James Burn	Good morning guys. Quick one from me. To what extent do you think that the proposed tax reform in the U.S. affects the economics in Magnolia?	Gregory Vesey	It does obviously. It's pretty simple response. Our President would like to reduce corporate taxes so therefore would be beneficial. I think that we have modeled our economics based on the current statutory rates around the globe with our tax planning strategies that we expect to employee. So anything that occurs in this space would be an upside. I think it is important to realize that you are talking about 20 year project life span and as I think everyone on the phone knows there is typically quite a bit of variability and what happens with tax rates as new President and new senate and in-house representatives move in and out have to do deal with budgetary issues. Obviously we are looking at quite closely and we will continue to monitor. We are not dependent on that factor to make our project economic.	James Burn	Sure. Okay. And just secondly from me, where you think whole pricing at the moment I guess the same couple of years ago that tell price sort of peak around $2.50 level where are they relative to that not necessarily specific to Magnolia but across U.S. projects more broadly.	Gregory Vesey	I think what we talked about publicly James and I think most of our competitors aligned with it, they’re really $2.50 to $3 range now if you are going to compete in this market.	James Burn	Sure. Okay. Thanks guys.	Gregory Vesey	Thank you.	Operator	[Operator Instruction]	Gregory Vesey	Yes. So while we are waiting, I will go to some questions that are submitted from shareholders and folks on our website. One was when are you expecting to announce renewal of lease agreement with Lake Charles Port, well if you haven't seen it. We announced that agreement with Lake Charles this week and they have approved that. So we are pushing forward with the site under our full loaned lease agreement there.	Here is another question. Why don't we have a monthly update for shareholders?	Well, I’d say two things we will do this quarterly we’re glad folks are interested and so we will obviously do this every quarter. There will also be special events where we would do this if we find it necessary to have a call or perhaps a special event but there is just not enough change to justify the calls on a monthly basis. So, I think if you can count on us quarterly or whenever there is a specific event we will certainly do that.	Alright. It's looking on the line like we have made you all happy. So I am not seeing any other questions from folks. I am assuming you are going to digest this and probably come back to us over the next week or two.	Operator	We currently have a question on the line. Your next question comes from the line of [Bryan Nottingham] from LNG limited. Please go ahead.	Unidentified Analyst	Hey I am sorry I missed that the earlier part of the presentation. I was just wondering if there are any updates on the binding tolling agreements.	Gregory Vesey	Sure, Bryan and I would clarify for the folks while at LNG Limited. Bryan is now one of our employee, we called him through LNG Limited line. We are having very good conversations on your all take agreements. We are actively marketing about three times the capacity of the facilities and are in discussions with a lot of folks and looking to finalize documents. I can't say much more than that obviously we want to close those assets as everyone else. The discussions continue to be strong on those and I do feel confident that we are going to be at the leading edge of signing some of these first tolling agreements.	Unidentified Analyst	Thank you.	Gregory Vesey	Thank you so much.	Operator	[Operator Instruction] Your next question today comes from the line of [Rogendra Barska] a private investor. Please go ahead.	Unidentified Analyst	I mean, I was going through the presentation and there were three possible parts so I know I mean, there is a delay in getting tolling agreement why can't we start marketing OSMR technology and basically earn some money instead of like give it to third parties and market that in the meantime?	Gregory Vesey	Yes. So that's a great question and it's very consistent with our strategy when we refocused our strategy late last year we will use the OSMR technology not only for our own development projects but also as entry way into new projects and our third path is a licensing agreement with others. While we don't currently have anything to report on that, we are putting that business planned together and I have already begun discussions with others interested in using our technology. So thanks great question.	Unidentified Analyst	Thank you.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Henderson, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.	Andrew Henderson	Hi Greg, thanks for the presentation. I just wanted to ask there are a number of subtleties in your slide pack particularly on slide 16 and 17 regarding three quarter range of capacity built. Now, assuming that refers to commencing [indiscernible] maybe 6 tons sold or less can you comment any further and I probably would have asked this previously, is the board still considering pushing the button on the [indiscernible] you can convert the current conversation with the Indians or other parties and add that to read in and get going with 6 tons.	Michael Reed Mott	So this is Mike and thanks for the question. I think as you said there is some subtleties here. I think the selection of 50% and 75% of the facility being constructed was to reflect as I said the dollar averaging effect that you see on slide 16 and then the potential effect it has on the required tolling that would be necessary to give a proper return to equity investors and to get the project financed. As we have said, we believe that we would depending on the credit and the pricing of the arrangements, I will take arrangements that we would assign that we, there is potential for us to take to the board and FID decision on 6 million tons. However, obviously we are progressing towards an 8 million ton project. The economics are better at 8 million tons obviously than 6. But again at some point in time we would have to make that determination with the board. But given the amount of activity we have on the marketing side and where we are headed and as Greg had mentioned the size of the discussions, contracting discussions that we are having being 3x of our total capacity we do feel confident we will get done with the full 8 million tons. It's a matter of when not if.	Andrew Henderson	Thanks Mike. Probably just a follow-up question to that. Critical element of your strategies obviously OSMR and Greg touched on it, but it's not outlined in the presentation but he touched on it earlier that turns lights to operational saving and effectively then more competitive tolling arrangements is it correct to assume that OSMR from an OpEx perspective and a fade gas efficiency is considerably more optimal than competing technologies which therefore puts you in a better price not on the CapEx per ton but an OpEx per ton basis and how is that placing you guys in your confidence in being able to convert the remaining capacity versus your competitors out there.	Gregory Vesey	Yes. Great question Andrew. I think with the word I would use here is balanced. So you could find a project that we are having lower capital costing us, but the operating expense is going to be very high. What we have is the best combination of CapEx and operating costs that puts us on the lower level across all of those which is due directly to the OSMR technology and using my guess using important component of not only our projects but also on marketing program for the OSMR technology. So thanks for that.	Andrew Henderson	Thanks Greg.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Robert [indiscernible] from Olympic. Please go ahead.	Unidentified Analyst	Hey guys, thanks for the update I appreciate it. Hey a quick question. Mike I know you talked, Greg and Mike you talked a little bit about the environment for the off takes relative to where you are in negations and tolling but can you discuss a little bit about some of the other topics that we have been hearing about. One is obviously the ability to get 20 year off takes I mean, if duration become a real issue and I guess the other question I have is with the reopeners obviously some of the Asian contracts have reopened a provisions in them. That's something that your clients are talking about and then lastly, obviously there has been a lot of discussion around the Japanese [indiscernible] equity linked, or oil linked index how is that coming into play relative to some of your customers looking from a pricing perspective?	Gregory Vesey	Okay. Sure. So Rob thanks for the questions and we will do our best to respond. I think with respect to the first one regarding the tenure of the contracts, obviously there has been contracts done in the marketplace since 2014 has been seasonal to short duration 3 to 5 years. I think much of the discussion in the market has been that clearly 20 year deals are going to be difficult to do and this is the timeframe on tenure of transactions was reducing and how is that ultimately will be realized in trying to finance a Greenfield project.	Interestingly enough, although conversations with buyers have discussed what we would be willing to do they also are mature conversations about the understanding knowledgeably what is required to provide the financing for these projects to get them done. And so, the group that we are in conversations with, significant conversations with all of them remain at the 20 year term and frankly it hasn't been a large push back from the buyers’ community. I do know that some others have disclosed a willingness to reduce we would if it fits within our total financing package, we too might look at that but obviously we prefer the 20 years. It's what the lending community, the banking community has seen before. They are comfortable with that model and anything that is a shorter duration I think creates link and undated negotiation with the financing side of the shop if you’re indeed able to get the OpEx to a grade to a 20 year deal. In terms of price reopeners, obviously that will be on a contract by contract basis. And I think right now our standard contract is very much like other contracts that have been made public in the marketplace on other companies’ websites and frankly kind of the standard fair in the industry.	Again with the people we are negotiating with no one is hard trading that particular issue and again it will ultimately come down to what the signature on the bottom line says and the details in each of those contracts but we do not see that as a significant conversation at this point but that could change in the future. And in terms of pricing perspective I think that the biggest challenge that we have seen is probably from the European buyers who are really looking to see if there is a way to do some pricing off the Dutch or off the NBP which is quite problematic because of the liquidity and ability to hedge that and frankly they were looking for developers to manage that risk. That's quite difficult. That was probably 3 quarters of the year ago and I think conversations have matured since then, they understand those challenges. Outside of that I think most buyers are still looking at a hub based or rent based contract quite similar to what you see historically and so I don't see any real challenges there.	Unidentified Analyst	Great. That was helpful. Thank you. Just real quickly can you talk Mike, I know, as you talked previously, you obviously have a deal on place [indiscernible] for the equity financing portion of the deal. Can you just talk at this juncture how you are looking at financing the project from a debt to equity standpoint and then talk a little bit about how the debt market has changed relative to what we saw for updates. Maybe little bit about just, I am sorry go ahead.	Gregory Vesey	No you finish your question.	Unidentified Analyst	And then if you could just discuss your cash burn currently?	Gregory Vesey	Sure. Okay. So we are in conversation with Stonepeak about reorganizing if you will that the deal that was struck back in 2012-2013 timeframe. They have recognized that we materially de-risk the project and that the economics that were embedded in the original deal should have been influenced by that de-risking. Alongside that is the fact that they also recognized the reduced economics that have crept into the LNG business because of the lower off take pricing driven by the lower crude price. So we are in really nice good conversation with them. We are deep into the finalization of that arrangement and I do think there will be a disclosure about that sometime in the second quarter of this year.	With respect to the debt equity we are looking somewhere between 70:30 to 75:25 we think that that's financeable but again are doable in the current marketplace but obviously ultimately that becomes down to pricing and the credit in the off takes which we do business with and so that will be a focus item of those contracts. In terms of the debt markets what's changed, I think probably most significant change that you would see between a year and a half to 18 months ago and today is that there was obviously quite a large amount of investments into some of the Gulf coast project that got bills or are still under construction Sabine, Free port, Cameron etc. I think that there were some very significant capital rise, large amounts of debt that that were embedded in those projects and what you have begun to see is those companies are beginning to unwind their position, their loan positions replacing those with corporate bonds or notes.	As a result that's bringing us capacity from the banking lender kind of perspective that is nothing but beneficial for us. They look for home to invest their money in that gives returns, they love the LNG industry because of the way the contracting of that industry is put together and the certainties of those cash flows. So our advice for BNP Paribas as well as management feel very confident about our ability to close.	I would say that interest rates are potentially an issue if you see the Fed doing interest rates and fiscal decisions that have been taken, interest rates have crept up, there are still well within in the range we have our economics, we think there is plenty of cushions for further rises is in the quarter rates. But in any respect until we do get close that remains a risk and to be honest it further feeds Greg's principle message in his discussions earlier on that if buyers are looking for certainty in price, certainty in timing and certainty in their off take pricing they negotiate being a solid contract doing sooner than later is important and that implies not only to the EPC cost but it also has a factor in the debt cost.	Unidentified Analyst	Great. Thanks so much and – go ahead.	Michael Reed Mott	Getting to the cash burn we have disclosed and if you look at our interim financial that we disclosed there is in that embedded in that not only the cash burn that you can look back since kind of June of 2016 forward that's more representative of what we would expect our cash burn to be over on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Also in those disclosures is an estimate of next quarter's cash flow so I think I’d point you to that as being the best estimate at this time, but that as Greg said our cash management program has continued to reflect our plans that we put in place in 2016 and we continue to be on pace with that. We are confident that our current cash position gets us to 2019 and that's been our goal the whole time.	Unidentified Analyst	Great. Last question and I’ll get back to the queue. What is your lending syndicate? How do they look at [indiscernible] that you currently have at place just from bank ability perspective? Thank you.	Michael Reed Mott	So. the lender consortium if you will hasn't seen it because we don't have one at this point. It's still with Paribas, we haven't gone out for that at this level yet because we are not mature enough in the time to finance yet. But Paribas recognizes that it's a structured transaction. It would have to be make sure that the credit is back-to-back. They are very happy with the uniform credit on their side which is the trading on for what was on, but obviously there is this structuring that we would have to do which at this point we haven't done because of the status of the two projects. But they recognized that with the right structuring it would be viewed as the credit worthy project and we have a plan. It's indeed those projects, both project get the FID. We know how we would structure that and Paribas largely sign that off.	Unidentified Analyst	Great, thanks for the update. I really appreciate it.	Gregory Vesey	You bet.	Operator	[Operator Instruction]	Gregory Vesey	Okay. It looks like we are out of questions which is fine. I do want to well there is a couple more --	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Greg Mitchell who is a Private Investor. Please Goa head.	Greg Mitchell	Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for the presentation. It's very good. I have just got a quick question. You mentioned that Magnolia Shovel ready what's your expectations of construction time for the project if you were to once you start to commence construction?	Gregory Vesey	Yes. Thanks. I think if you take 18 months to first LNG, 55 months, 54-55 months for whole completion of the plant that's kind of what we publicly released as our current timeframe, Greg.	Greg Mitchell	Great, thank you.	Gregory Vesey	Sure.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Travis, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.	Kyle Travis	Hi guys I hope we are going to wrap the call soon, but just wanted to have a quick discussion on the off take duration and if there is – to what degree is the flexibility and could it be structured where can we get down to 10 or 15 year tolling agreements and if so what would have to be, would it have to be equity, would it just be higher tolling rate. Just more debt amortization I just want to know I see a lot of vendor account there and the 20 year contracts and just with like the color on that? Thank you guys.	Gregory Vesey	Yes Kyle thanks so I think after this call or this question we will call the end of the call if we can moderator. But to your point Kyle essentially as you know the projects that have been built are in construction at very strong credits with 20 year deals and the financing of those projects as a model, a president model was very well known and understood by the lending community. Maybe variability of that will obviously take scrutiny and the affect of that on pricing, the affect of that on the amount of debt that you can raise relative to those projects and frankly the sizing of the overall ability in terms of the total financing begins to come in the question.	Now, I personally believe the financing world will solve that puzzle and we will realize a way to achieve a positive outcome for the right infrastructure projects with the right off take behind it. As you know the world tends to gravitate the strong projects, the strong credit, the strong cash flows and I think that issue would be solved. I think what it translates into because it would be a bit of an unknown and kind of new ground being broken here, I think it would translate into time and an extended period of financial close there could be cost implications on the overall process. I think there could be some work with buyers about how solid those options are to move it forward so that bank lenders might get more comfort with it or not but it’s a difficult bridge to cross. So my sense is and again the conversation that we are having the buyers recognize this and they understand what it takes and they understand that these are large kind of world class infrastructure construction projects and they understand what it takes to finance. And so, again we are not seeing that but I do just fundamentally as a finance guy I feel reasonably comfortable that ultimately you will see more and more of lesser credits and stagger terms within deals that heavily move forward in this business but right now we don't see that as part of the Magnolia portfolio.	Kyle Travis	Thank you guys. I appreciate it.	A - Gregory Vesey	I appreciate it. Thank you moderator for your help. Let me just close this, first of all thank you all for your time this evening. We appreciate your interest in LNG Limited and our projects. And as I mentioned we are going to continue to keep you informed on this. Obviously the buzz word for this presentation is certainty we can offer, certainty of cost, certainty of schedule, certainty of pricing, so that's the message we are going to be taking to the marketplace. And for those of you that are buyers out there we work on the start of discussions with ourselves. Thanks again. We wish you all be safe and we will talk to you again soon.

2,"Hill International, Inc. (NYSE:HIL)",RIO,Q4 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call,"March 30, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives	Devin Sullivan - SVP, The Equity Group Inc.	David Richter - CEO	John Fanelli - EVP and CFO	Analysts	Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets	Pete Enderlin - MAZ Partners	Operator	Greetings, and welcome to the Hill International Incorporated reports 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A question-and-answer will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.	I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Devin Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. You may begin.	Devin Sullivan	Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our speakers for today's call will be David Richter, Chief Executive Officer of Hill International and John Fanelli, Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

We do not intend and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.	With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to David Richter. David, please go ahead.	David Richter	Thank you, Devin and good morning to everyone joining us for today’s earnings conference call. First, let's apologize for the delay of the release for our fourth quarter earnings, which occurred yesterday and the filing of our 10-K, which will occur tomorrow. This was necessary because certain potential tax liabilities were discovered in the course of due diligence related to the sale of our Construction Claims Group. This required [ph] that we obtain assistance of an independent tax advisor to value our potential liability. We couldn’t complete our year-end numbers until their review was complete and accepted by our auditors. That review was just completed and as a result, we incurred a $2.19 non-cash reserve in the fourth quarter of last year to account for those potential tax liabilities. Those are historical liabilities that relate only to the Claims Group and do not impact or affect our project management group.	Second, as result of the depending Claims Group sale which we currently expect will close on or about April 30th, for financial reporting purposes, we have cleared [ph] the Claims Group together with our existing senior credit facilities which will be paid off and terminated upon closing as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This of course means that models of our financial performance, both past and future will need to be updated accordingly.	So, let's get right into the numbers. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $128.8 million, a 14% drop from the fourth quarter of 2015. Consulting fee revenue for the fourth quarter was $100.6 million, an 18% decline from the prior year's fourth quarter. The overall decline in our consulting fees for the quarter was driven primarily by $22.8 million decline or 34% in our Middle East operations and by a $3.2 million drop or 47% in our Latin American operations. This was partially offset by strong growth in our U.S. operation with consulting fees up $5.1 million or 17% during the quarter from a year earlier.	Our Company's gross profit in the fourth quarter declined $37.8 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our gross margin as a percent of consulting fees was also down but only slightly by 30 basis points to 37.6%. Companywide, our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $41.7 million, down 4% from the year earlier quarter, but SG&A margin as a percent of consulting fees was up by 600 basis points to 41.5%.	SG&A expenses from our project management group was $32.5 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% from a year earlier; as a percent of consulting fees, they were 32.3%, up 490 basis points. Our corporate SG&A expenses were $9.2 million for the quarter, down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2015; as a percent of consulting fees, they were up a 100 basis points from a year ago to 9.2%.	Hill’s operating loss for the fourth quarter was $3.9 million versus an operating profit of $2.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. The net loss from continuing operations was $4.3 million or negative $0.08 per diluted share compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of the prior year. Net loss from discontinued operations was $10.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $3.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share a year earlier.	On a consolidated basis, Hills net loss for the fourth quarter was $14.9 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.1 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a negative $2.3 million compared to positive EBITDA of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.	Unusual expenses for the quarter totaled $5 million or $0.10 per diluted share, adversely impacting Hill’s profitability. Most of these unusual expenses were included in discontinued operations including $2.2 million in legal and another fees in connection with the sale of our Claims Group and the $2.1 million tax contingency I discussed at the beginning of the call.	In addition, in continuing operations, we incurred a $700,000 loss on the sale of a long-term investment. In addition, although we have not termed it an unusual expense, we had a very high level of bad debt expense during the fourth quarter totaling $6 million. Of this amount, $1.9 million was from the Claims Group and $4.2 million was from the project management group. Although less than $8.6 million of bad debt expense we incurred in the third quarter of last year, this level of reserves in a single quarters is extremely unusual. For comparison, in all of 2015, we took $9.1 million in accounts receivable reserves. For the full-year of 2016, we had $17.9 million in bad debt expense.	As a result of our financial results for the fourth quarter, Hill would have been in default for certain financial covenants under our senior credit facilities, but we have obtained a waiver of those defaults from our lending group.	With respect to backlog, our backlog was down 7% during the fourth quarter to $831 million. The geographic breakdown of our total backlog is 55% from United States, 33% from the Middle East, 5% from Europe, 5% from Africa, 1% from Asia Pacific and 1% from Latin America. Our 12-month backlog at the end of the year was $334 million, down 6% during the quarter. We sold new project management work during the fourth quarter of $117 million, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 116%, above our minimum quarterly target of 110%. But we had two contracts totaling $73 million of backlog get canceled during the quarter which is why our backlog was down as of year-end.	Large contracts we won and announced since our last earnings call include a $35 million contract to provide project management and construction management services to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in California; a $16 million contract to provide facilities management services to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and $8 million to manage the reconstruction of a 13-mile segment of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a $7 million contract to manage construction of a container facility at a port in Morocco, a $4 million contract to manage construction of Al Wa'ab City in Qatar, $3 million contract to manage modernization of two buildings at the Social Security Administration campus in Maryland, a $3 million contract to manage our Masdar Institute Neighborhood in Abu Dhabi, several contracts totaling $3 million to provide construction engineering and inspection services to the Florida Department of Transportation, a $2 million contract to manage renovation of the Ashley [ph] Courthouse in Ohio, and a major contract to manage $1 billion Uberseequartier Sud mixed-use development in Germany.	With respect to guidance for this year, in our earnings release we provided guidance of between $400 million and $425 million with respect to our expected consulting fee revenues for 2017. This guidance equates to the tune of 2% and 8% decrease in expected consulting fees for the year. Other than consulting fees, we are providing no further guidance for the year at this time.	And with that, John and I are happy to take any of your questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.	Tahira Afzal	Thank you. David, first question is in regards to the bad debt you saw in the fourth quarter. What was this? We've been seeing a lot of scrubbing on your receivables which obviously improves the quality of your balance sheet, but would love to get a sense when this all ends and what you assess as the risk of further scrubbing going forward.	David Richter	Yes, Tahira, thanks for the question. Obviously, a lot of these receivables, in fact the majority of them relate to clients in the Middle East. And the economic situation over there is there's no secret and has been pretty poor for the last several years. It's why we saw a shrinkage in our business last year, revenue wise in the Middle East and we expect another one again this year. Low oil prices have caused a lot of difficulties with a lot of our clients public and private in their construction activity; it's impacted their cash flow, the cash availability, has made situation more difficult for us. The biggest write-down, more than a third of it in the fourth quarter related to the contact, one of the contacts that was cancelled. In the third quarter, it related -- the biggest number of -- about half it related to us writing overseas [ph] and it was in Iraq because of the political situation there. So, the foresight is this is a difficult time to have a major presence in Middle East, which we do. But, as I said earlier in the call, we'll be getting work in the Middle East; we're expecting that to improve as oil prices have headed up. So, maybe this is little more robust than others, but certainly, we're not the only [ph] doing business in the Middle East to see some challenges.	Tahira Afzal	Got it. And David, how much in receivables do you still have on your balance sheets from these particular regions, and not the Middle East as a whole because clearly there's some portions that have a better liquidity right now than some of the others. So, really the ones that you are seeing some write-downs if you can quantify that for us?	David Richter	We have about $200 million in net receivables throughout the Company, neither John or I have geographic breakdown of those receivables. But if you look at the numbers for the whole year, about 2% which is extraordinarily high number for us historically, even last year at $9 million which was about 1.25%. We very rarely historically have seen that number go over 1% of our revenues.	Tahira Afzal	Could we kind of see something similar you think this year as well, I guess I'm just trying to see what the risks are to further write down this year.	David Richter	Without a crystal ball, to try to give you any color is guesstimate. [Ph] We’re expecting that situation in Middle East has sort of bottomed out; we're expecting 2017 to kind of be a better year with respect to new work. Work we win this year help us a lot more in 2018. And as I said, we're expecting our Middle East business to shrink this year, and we're planning for that and reacting to it.	Tahira Afzal	Could you still see your free cash flow, net-net, do we expect it to be positive this year, David? So, are the rest of the businesses at this point really offsetting some of the pressures you’re seeing there?	David Richter	Yes. We expect operating cash flow to be positive this year; it was positive last year. We’ve given some guidance earlier in the year of about $20 million to $25 million of operating cash flow. And we saw that $10 million, because of lot of unanticipated the expenses, sale of the Claims Group, the proxy fight [ph] and some other issues related to some of these Middle East projects that impacted it. But, we expect to see even better cash flow this year.	Tahira Afzal	I’ve got more questions, David, but I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you.	Operator	Our next question comes from the line of Pete Enderlin of MAZ Partners. Please proceed with your questions.	Pete Enderlin	David, I didn’t get the number that you mentioned on the project cancelations from backlog in the first quarter. What was that number?	David Richter	That was $73 million related to two projects, one in Africa, one in the Middle East.	Pete Enderlin	Right, okay. And just broadly speaking, do you think in the Middle East specifically in terms of new contracts, new business wins, are you losing market share or holding market share? In other words, the overall economy and the market is bad but are you doing as poorly or worse than the overall environment in that particular geographical region?	David Richter	Market share is really something we talked about, just given how huge the market is, how big [ph] players are. But I think when the sand blows [ph] everybody else with it. [Ph]	Pete Enderlin	I mean, do you think that your win rate is still holding up fairly well, given the reduced level of activity.	David Richter	Yes, I think it is. We're still bringing work in door; we're seeing fewer project opportunities out there, we're seeing delays in existing projects. We also said had some major projects end last year because we completed it, our most successful [ph] projects, actually finished the project. That was a major revenue generator for us and that completed in the third quarter. And we're also seeing -- we’ve begun processes of demobilizing, slowing on the airport project, which still has about a year and half to go. And we're currently negotiating a one year extension of our contract, but as the project gets close to the completion, we’ve been winding down our staff to some degree. So [indiscernible] revenues on that project as well. That’s the biggest project we have [indiscernible].	Pete Enderlin	Right. And then, same kinds of questions related to Brazil. Is it really just the overall market weakness or do you think you have an issue with your subsidiary there in terms of the ability to generate new business?	David Richter	I think that we have a very good team in Brazil, but I think we a market as an economic and political environment in Brazil is just an absolute collapse. I don’t know any better way to describe it than that but there is very well little activity there; the business has been shrinking for a while. We had some significant work on the Olympics last year in Rio, both work directly on the Olympics and work related to it. And now that work is all completed. And that’s something I could say [indiscernible] about the environment down there or our expectations for future work. We anticipate that business is likely to continue to shrink until there is a major economic change in that market.	Pete Enderlin	Right, okay. And then, I know you are not giving specific EBITDA guidance but how should we think about the factors that are going to influence that just sort of directionally? Your gross margins have held up pretty well and you are taking a more aggressive approach to costs but you have to wait a little while to get over the support of the construction claims business. So, what do we think is going to be the general trend of EBITDA margin for the year?	David Richter	We are not going to give any specific guidance on that. There is a lot of moving parts to this. And the situation we are in is that we've got now the Claims Group being treated as discontinued operation on our financials. But we've got the corporate overhead to continue to run both the PM and the Claims Group. In fact [indiscernible] this year than they've ever been with the transition to sale, the things we we’re doing to get the closing and then if we are going to have to continue for several months after closing to support that company as it becomes an independent firm. Once that completes, and we expect it will be complete in various stages over the course of the summer, then we are going to be taking a real strong look at being able to cut our overheads structure, costs, as a result once Claims Groups is fully [ph] spot off. We're anticipating that we are going to spend -- once that transaction is closed, the remainder of the year looking at rightsizing our overhead.	Operator	[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from the line of Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your follow-up.	Tahira Afzal	David, first follow-up is in terms of setting the top line guidance. I kind of see it's sort of in line with your year-on-year backlog decline, which has been a pretty good correlation in the past. But, would love to get a sense on how you've approached setting your revenue guidance, given the last couple of two years have been -- last couple of years have been tough, have you tried to take a more conservative approach or change anything?	David Richter	Well, the guidance is based upon a couple of different things, one is our budget for the year. We don’t disclose our budget but our budget is within that range. It factors in the fact that we are expecting shrinkage in Latin America and the Middle East and expecting that to continue. Claims Group typically provides a lot of variability and expectations regarding revenues, although lately they've been sort of right in the middle of their range. And I wouldn’t say it’s more conservative or less conservative than it has but certainly we had a lot of factors affecting us in 2016 that led us to missing our original targets. And I expect that financial group [ph] expense in 2017 will be able to deliver consulting fees within this range that is given.	Tahira Afzal	And David, is there reason you haven't given some sort of parameters around your EBITDA outlook for 2017? Are you -- is it because your cost cutting plans are still pretty nascent? I would love to get any color on that.	David Richter	Like I said to Pete, I mean, a lot of this is up in the air for quite some time. [Ph] We've been doing a lot of cost cutting over the last six months, in response to three principal things. One is we knew the Claims Group was going to be spun off and we're taking a hard look at our corporate structure and overhead cost. The business has been shrinking over the last year. This is the first year in 23 years I've been with the Company that we shrank revenues and it looks like 2017 will be the second year. And we're planning for that. So, we’ve got to bring our overhead costs in line with that and we have a new board in place that's going to be aggressive in forcing me and the rest of the management team to improve profitability, cut our overhead costs and other indirect costs and deliver more and more consistent profitability for our shareholders. We'll have a better ability to take costs out once the Claims Group is formally spun off and we no longer have to provide corporate support for it. Given a lot of that stuff is in flux, it's really difficult for us to give EBITDA guidance, like we've done the last couple of years.	Tahira Afzal	David, last quarter you did kind of hint in a sense at what those corporate costs could be and where you could take them. Do those sort of guidance factors still -- I wouldn't say guidance but indicators, would those still hold or is what you said over the last quarter or so is that not valid anymore?	David Richter	I would say that once we get through this process, and by through I mean probably by Labor Day, we'll have a sort of a normalized I expect third quarter and fourth quarter. And we'll be able to probably use that as a benchmark for establishing guidelines on SG&A expenses, on EBITDA margins going forward. But until the Claims Group is spun off, until our cost cutting is fully complete, it's really difficult for us to do any there.	Tahira Afzal	Got it, okay.	David Richter	With any degree of accuracy which is what you want, of course.	Tahira Afzal	Right. Well, I guess what I'm trying to see is can you strive to get back -- if I look at 2013, and granted you don't a claims business and you have a smaller business in general, but, are we still looking at sort of 9, 10% EBITDA margins, adjusted EBITDA margins as being possible or the headwinds you're facing on the macro side and all the adjustments it's tough to really see those in your near to medium term?	David Richter	Well, the biggest challenge we're facing is that historically we had two operating groups that were profitable, supporting the corporate cost of a public company. Going forward, we're going to have one group and that group is going to be smaller than it was over the last couple of years, smaller and less profitable. The Middle East has really been our profit engine, and last year and this year we're expecting that operation, while still profitable and while still contributing a lot to the Company's overall profitability, not going to be what it was two or three years ago. To your question specifically, I think 10% EBITDA margins in the short-term term are not realistic.	Tahira Afzal	And I guess by asking what would be possible I’m cornering you into something you don’t want to give, right, right now. So, I mean if you look over let's say the next couple of years, are we looking at potentially sort of 8% type of EBITDA margin spend in a sense? And I know I'm not cornering your for really what you think in 2017 but once you’ve adjusted all your EBITDA cost -- sorry your corporate costs out, just so that we can -- we're not setting numbers that are too aggressive?	David Richter	I really can’t give you any numbers; I can't say if that’s reasonable or unreasonable. We simply don’t want to give any guidance or pick a number out of a thin air. I think once we get through this process and we can have a clean quarter without any unusual expenses, without severance, without cost of us carrying a business that’s being treated discontinued on our financial statements, I think we’ll be in a better shape to say, what this is going to look like coming out of this. So, I think once we have our third quarter in the books, absent any other major changes in our market environment or cost structure, I think that’s where we're going to be in a short-term.	Operator	Our next question comes from the line of [Arnav of Engine Capital]. [Ph] Please proceed with your question.	Unidentified Analyst	Couple of questions, I guess one on the cost cutting that Tahira was talking about and I guess you were talking about, is any intention to use a consultant to look at that?	David Richter	That is one thing that board has been discussing; they haven’t made a final determination. But I think it’s probably more likely than not, we may bring in somebody [ph] from outside to help guide us through this process as we [indiscernible].	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. For what it’s worth, I think that would be a good thing to have outside eyes taking a look at the cost structure. You talked about $25 million of operating cash flow earlier during the call, was that -- can you remind me again the context of when that number was given?	David Richter	Yes. I think exactly a year ago, we gave a forecast for 2016 of $20 million to $25 million of operating cash flow. We did about 10 but we also had a lot of unexpected things occur.	Unidentified Analyst	And so, I think after that comment, you said that you expected the operating cash flow to be higher and did you refer to 2017, did you refer long-term, did you mean to comment that operating cash flow was going to be higher than that?	David Richter	What I meant was in 2017, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly higher than $10 million.	Unidentified Analyst	Oh, than 10, but compared to the 20, 25?	David Richter	I’m not sure I’m prepared to give a target.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. And I would think that since you have some much working capital tied to the Middle East, as the Middle East shrinks, I would think that it's going to become a very significant source of cash, is that a fair assumption.	David Richter	Our experience has been that business like ours, it's carried a lot of receivables, our business is growing quickly, it's consuming cash, when it’s shrinking throwing [ph] cash. And a good example of that is the MI Airport, as I said, we think we're about 18 months away from the conclusion of that. We have a significant amount of money tied up [indiscernible] and what's called the DLP, the defects and liability period that’s money held by client until about 12 to 18 months after the project is completed. We're expecting all of that money to be returned to us in addition to the receivables that we’re owed. So, once that project completes and we have no more costs related to it, we see a significant withdrawal of cash coming our way just with that one project.	Unidentified Analyst	So, you said you would get that money 18 months after completion which is in 18 months or is that two years from now or now you are expecting the cash to come in 18 months?	David Richter	The final payment is -- the two various payment periods. The cash should come in over the course of 12 to 18 months from the completion of the project. Over the next roughly two to three years.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. Directionally can you give us an indication of how big the number is?	David Richter	John, what’s the total retainage and DLP?	John Fanelli	Around $16 million.	David Richter	Around $16 million. That’ separate from the receivables that were owed and that were collecting as of the year-end, as of December 31st.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. Because pro forma of the sale -- if I get the number right, pro forma of the sale of the claim [ph] the enterprise value year-to-date is on 200. So, I mean you are talking about almost close to 10% of the enterprise value and you say that's not receivable that's like a retainage you said?	David Richter	It's a combination of retainage and what's called the DLP where for a certain period of time after the project is completed, the client holds the money in case there are any major problems and we don’t at this point anticipate any of that money being withheld by the line. And you’re right, it’s about 10% of our market cap money that will see after the completion of the project, once we have no more cost related to providing our services.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. Can you give us an update on the timing -- you guys talked about the timing for the sale of the Claims division. Can you just talk about what's holding it up and any updates there?	David Richter	Yes. We were originally targeting the end of February, which got pushed to end of March as over the last couple of weeks it became apparent that Bridgepoint wasn’t in a position to close and we weren’t in a position to satisfy all the closing conditions out of the stock purchase agreement. So, we pushed it to April 30th and they are anticipating [ph] closing month end. So, this is a one month delay and we are working hard to complete all the things that we need to complete. Those involve assignments and consensus from some of the largest clients and landlords; it involves completing all of the corporate restructuring that we've done and making sure all the new entities in certain places are licensed to do business have appropriate tools, [ph] and then Bridgepoint getting their file internal approvals and the consent of their lenders to sign the deal and having it closed. We worked hard to get it done March 31st but that just didn’t happen so the current time we are expecting is April 30th.	Unidentified Analyst	And I guess the bigger picture question, given the size of the corporate overhead in relation to I guess EBITDA overhead, at what point does it make sense to consider as strategic alternative in thinking about whether more value could be realized from shareholders by looking at different owner that potentially does not need to carry this big corporate overhead.	David Richter	That's upto our Board to decide. We haven't had any conversations regarding doing exactly that. But that's always a possibility we're public company; we're for sale every day for the right buyer at the right price. We're focused on writing the business, improving our margins, getting our corporate overhead down. We need work and continue to execute, and we've got a lot of headwinds as you well know, as we well know at the moment but I think we’re doing all the right things right now to position the shareholders to make more money going forward…	Unidentified Analyst	So, you were talking about $10 million free cash flow, you expect this year to be better, so against pretty significant free cash flow as compared to the enterprise value, plus you talk about the stuff from Oman. So, for what it’s worth, the stock seems very cheap.	David Richter	Thank you, we agree.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay, well maybe hopefully we're going to see some insider buying after the transaction close. I would love to see some insider buying, so maybe you can share that with the Board.	David Richter	Yes, I will. And keep in mind, we've been restricted from trading effectively for the last 15 months with the Claims…	Unidentified Analyst	Understood. So, I'm sure that there is pent up demand from the Board that I expect to see.	David Richter	I will pass that message along.	Unidentified Analyst	Thank you, David. Talk to you soon.	Operator	There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.	David Richter	Great, thank you everyone for your interest in our Company and for participating in our call this morning. We are looking forward to our next earnings call in early May. Take care.	Operator	This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful rest of your day.

Today’s conference is being recorded.	At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Christiane Pelz, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.

Joel Anderson	Thank you, Christiane. I will provide a review of our performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2016, go over the progress we are making against our strategic priorities and discuss key areas of focus for fiscal 2017. After that, Ken will discuss our financial results and outlook.	At the beginning of the year, we outlined our five-year strategy of 20/20 through 2020, which calls for 20% sales growth and greater than 20% net income growth through 2020. We met or exceeded these goals in 2016 highlighted by one, another strong class of new stores which is estimated to be our strongest class; two, our 11th consecutive year of positive comp sales growth; three, disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in the business; and four, as we’ve achieved in the past all stores were profitable.	Our focus on the Five Below customer and delivering the promised wow factor is unwavering. This means consistently delivering trend right products at unbelievable values. It has driven our strong operational and financial performance and we will stay true to this mission as we continue to expand our footprint and grow our brand.	Having hit the 1 billion sales milestone in 2016 and with top line growth of 20% expected, each passing year we are better positioned to leverage our growing scale and reinvest in our buying power to further strengthen our customer value proposition and deliver even more wow.	Now, turning to Q4 2016, we delivered sales growth of 19% to 388 million and earnings per share growth of 17% to $0.90 per share. Comp sales increased by 1% for the quarter as we anniversaried strong trends from last year.	For the full year 2016, sales were $1 billion, up 20% over last year. Our store count increased by 19% to 522 locations and comp sales increased by 2%. We generated operating leverage expanding margins by 20 basis points while continuing to make investments in the business, resulting in a 23% increase in operating income to 114 million and a 24% increase in earnings per share to $1.30.	It was two years ago on my first call as CEO at Five Below that I laid out our five key strategic priorities namely new stores, merchandizing, marketing, systems and infrastructure and people. We have made substantial progress against each of these priorities in the last two years where we focused on building on the success in 2017.	One, starting with new stores. In 2016, we opened 85 net new stores. We entered four new states; Louisiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Minnesota and the new markets of South Florida, Cincinnati and Rio Grande Valley. We also continued to densify our presence in existing markets such as our hometown of Philly where we opened an additional four stores.	2016 openings included a mix of smaller, semi-rural markets like Lafayette in Louisiana, suburban markets such as White Marsh in Maryland and urban markets like Brooklyn, New York. Our 2016 class is on track to be the strongest class ever and be the first class to reach the average $2 million market per year one sales. This strength remains broad based demonstrating the universal appeal of Five Below that is the foundation of our 2,000 plus store opportunity.	Customers in every market respond enthusiastically to our unique stores and trend right merchandize that delivers the wow factor at incredible value. This is what has made each class of store successful and also what makes us even more excited about the future of Five Below. It is this strong consistent performance right out of the gate that results in a less than one year payback period on our new store investment.	In 2017, we plan to open approximately 100 stores, the majority of which are strategically planned to open in existing markets to leverage brand awareness and further benefit from densification. We will enter California in 2017 with a cluster of nine stores in the Greater Los Angeles area at the end of April. Our people are in place, all our store managers are hired and our distribution center is ready to ship product.	We expect the economic profile of these stores to mirror the rest of the chain with high productivity, quick payback and strong contribution margins. We are excited to enter the state of California and look forward to building our presence in Southern California with additional stores in 2017 followed by increased openings in 2018 and beyond. California is expected to be our largest growth opportunity over time.	We are constantly looking for ways to innovate in our stores to keep them as fresh and exciting as our products and to improve the customer experience. Last year we began testing a refreshed Five Below concept with new features including a new look and feel for several of our worlds. We were pleased with the results. In a class of 17, we’ll incorporate these enhancements.	Number two, on the merchandizing front. Our new wow products particularly in Tech and Room were a big hit with customers in Q4. As we look ahead, we will continue to grow product development, build out our sourcing capabilities and leverage our scale to bring more trend right high-quality merchandize at amazing prices to our customers.	The team is focused on delivering our core value proposition by reinvesting in product both quality and price to deliver the wow that is our customer promise. We like the emerging trends we are seeing in Q1 as well as our initial set for Easter.	Number three, in marketing, we continue to optimize our medium mix. Within Digital and Media, we are focused on getting closer to where our customers are whether it’s on their mobile phones, on social media or watching on-demand video like YouTube. Looking ahead, we will continue to utilize TV in both Q2 and Q4 as we increase our presence in key existing markets to further leverage brand awareness and benefit from densification.	Another component of our expanding digital efforts is e-commerce, which we soft launched in August of 2016. We were very pleased with the performance of the site and what the team accomplished this first holiday season. I personally want to thank the team, led by David Makuen, for all of their hard work.	To grow the business and offer even more convenience to our customers, we are continuously enhancing the assortment and the mobile customer experience and will soon also be able to ship nationwide. Our comprehensive marketing initiatives both print and digital are focused on increasing top of mind and brand awareness to drive traffic to our growing store base. In addition, our real estate densification strategy is designed to increase our brand awareness more rapidly.	On the infrastructure and systems front, our leadership team has created efficiencies across our supply chain and has continued to improve our processes. We also continue to look for ways to improve the customer experience in-store. The multiyear phased-in system upgrades are progressing as planned.	We completed the financial systems component of our ERP implementation this past year and now are on to merchandize item planning and human resource information systems. Finally, as I mentioned last quarter, we are also preparing to move into our new home office at the beginning of 2018 to better accommodate our growing business.	Which brings us to our fifth strategic priority, people. As we have grown Five Below scale, we have also hired the necessary talent to drive our success further strengthening our teams across several functional areas; from merchandizing, to planning and allocation, to marketing, finance and human resources. We also added more training and development resources for the store associates. We will continue to opportunistically make the right hires at the right time and invest in the right systems to support the substantial growth that lies ahead.	Now, I’d like to turn it over to Ken to give more color on our financial results and discuss the guidance for next year. Ken?	Ken Bull	Thanks, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my remarks with the review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results and then discuss our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2017.	Our sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $388.1 million, up 18.9% from $326.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. We ended the quarter with 522 stores, an increase of 85 net new stores or 19.5% versus the 437 stores at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.	As Joel said, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores with the class of 2016 estimated to deliver on average $2 million in year one sales performance which is the highest in our history. Our stores continue to generate a payback on our new store investment in less than one year.	Comparable sales increased 1% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to a 3.6% comp increase in the fourth quarter of 2015. The comp increase for the fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by an increase in average ticket.	Gross profit increased 20.6% to a $159.4 million from $132.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points to 41.1% driven by improved merchandized shrink results and leverage from our new distribution center that we added in the second quarter of 2015.	As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to 20.8% from 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015 largely due to deleverage of expenses on the 1% comp. Our operating income increased 17.1% to $78.9 million or 20.3% of sales from $67.4 million or 20.6% of sales last year.	Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 36.9% compared to 37.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to certain discrete items. Net income increased 18.5% to $49.8 million or $0.90 per diluted share from $42 million or $0.77 per diluted share last year.	For fiscal 2016, total net sales were $1 billion, an increase of 20.2% over $832 million in fiscal 2015. Comparable sales increased 2% compared to 3.4% in 2015 driven by an increase in average ticket.	Gross profit for the full year increased 22.3% to $357 million from the $291.9 million reported in 2015. Gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points to 35.7% driven primarily by lower freight rate and leverage of distribution costs.	As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the year increased 40 basis points to 24.3% from 23.9% in 2015 partially due to the cost associated with our launch of e-commerce and our 2017 entry into California.	Operating income of $114 million increased 22.6% in 2016. Operating margin of 11.4% increased approximately 20 basis points from last year’s operating margin of 11.2%. Our effective tax rate for the year 2016 was 37.1% compared to 37.7% in 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was due to certain discrete items.	Net income increased 24.5% to $71.8 million. Earnings per share was $1.30 for fiscal 2016, an increase of 23.8% versus earnings per share of $1.05 for fiscal 2015. We ended the year with approximately $164 million in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investment securities and no debt.	This is an increase of approximately $65 million versus the end of fiscal 2015 reflecting our strong free cash flow generation. As a reminder, our new store investment is approximately $300,000 and pays back in less than one year on average, which contributes to our cash flow generation.	Inventory at the end of the year was $154.4 million as compared to $148.4 million at the end of 2015. Ending inventory on a per store basis decreased approximately 13% year-over-year driven by the timing of Easter holiday receipts due to the later holiday in 2017 and the lower penetration of direct imported goods. As a reminder, we take ownership of direct imported goods earlier as we record in-transit inventory on our balance sheet as soon as the goods leave the overseas port.	Now I would like to turn to our guidance. For the full year 2017, sales are expected to be in the range of $1.210 billion to $1.230 billion with the comparable sales increase in the low-single digits. This compares to net sales of $1 billion for 2016 representing a growth rate of 21% to 23%.	In 2017, we plan to open approximately 100 new stores and expect to end the year with a store count of 622 as compared to our 2016 ending store count of 522. As a reminder, the 2017 fiscal year includes a 53rd week which is expected to add approximately $15 million in sales and approximately $0.02 in EPS. Full year comparable sales are based on a 52-week fiscal year.	We expect to open approximately 60% of our new stores in the first half of 2017 in line with the percentage of new stores opened in the first half of 2016. The majority of new stores will be in existing markets and states with the one new state being California. For the full year, the midpoint of our guidance assumes relatively flat operating margins versus 2016.	We expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 37.5% and net income is expected to be in the range of $86 million to $89.5 million representing a growth rate of approximately 20% to 25% over 2016 with diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.61.	With respect to CapEx, we plan to spend in total approximately $78 million in 2017 reflecting the opening of approximately 100 new stores and investing in systems and infrastructure including distribution in our new home office. These gross capital expenditures exclude the impact of tenant allowances. Tenant allowances related to our new headquarters are approximately $10 million.	For the first quarter ending April 29, 2017, net sales are expected to be between $228 million to $232 million. We plan to open approximately 26 new stores in Q1 this year as compared to 21 stores opened in the first quarter last year, and are assuming a Q1 comp sales increase of flat to 2% versus the 4.9% comp increase in Q1 2016.	The first quarter is expected to be our toughest comparison versus last year as the strong trends we have spoken about continued last year in Q1 2016. We expect some deleverage in operating margin in the first quarter due to the lower expected comp and the end of quarter timing of our California openings. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 are expected to be $0.12 to $0.14.	This guidance does not include any impact from the new stock-compensation accounting standard 2016-09, which require excess income tax benefits for deficiencies to be recorded through the income statement as a tax impact instead of as additional paid in capital on the balance sheet. As the associated cost of vesting of equity grants as well as the exercise of stock options are dependent on the stock price throughout the quarter and year, we will report the impact if any with our quarterly results. For all other details related to our results on guidance, please refer to our earnings press release.	With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Joel to provide some closing comments before we open it up for questions. Joel?	Joel Anderson	Thanks, Ken. In closing, I want to say how excited I am for the future of Five Below. 2016 was a great year. We made progress on each of our strategic priorities and in 2017 we will continue to build on that progress. We are growing rapidly, opening approximately 100 new stores this year of which we’ve already completed nearly 20%. And we remain focused on delivering consistent performance on both the top and bottom line.	We have a strong track record of delivering consistent sales and earnings growth and we remain on track to achieve our 20/20 through 2020 strategy. Our ability to deliver consistent high growth is a testament to the strength of our business model, our commitment to deliver wow and value to our customers and disciplined execution by our teams. Our stores are unique and our offering and price points are so compelling.	Customers love Five Below as demonstrated by our recent record customer satisfaction score which was above our goal for the year and above averages of other retailers. Finally and most importantly, I want to thank all of our associates both here in the home office and out in the field for their ideas and hard work. We have a great team who has been and will continue to be key to our success.	Operator, please open the call for questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll first go to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.	Stephanie Chang	Hi, guys. This is actually Stephanie Chang on for Ed. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to merchandize, are there any specific products or categories that you’re excited about for the coming year? I noticed you mentioned tech and room I believe for standouts in Q4. Are there any categories that you are excited about for 2017? Thanks.	Joel Anderson	Tech and room were certainly drivers in Q4 and they continue to show great promise here in Q1, so we remain excited about those two key worlds for us. In addition to that, I don’t know if you saw our last ad, you would have saw that we featured slime and that is a trend that’s emerged here in the first quarter that we’re excited about as well as I would call out that we’re about to enter the important Easter season with a shift this year and I really like what I’m seeing for our Easter set. And then of course we’ll go into summer in Q2 which is really like a mini-Christmas for us and we feel really strong about our summer set that’s coming up here. Thanks, Stephanie.	Operator	We’ll next go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.	Paul Trussell	Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Two quick ones just to follow up on that last comment regarding excitement around certain categories. If you can just kind of delve at all into kind of what you’ve seen quarter-to-date and whether delayed tax refunds had any impact to your business to start off the year? And then second for Ken, really just interested in how you’re thinking about new store productivity this year just given the opening of doors in existing markets along with obviously this initial entry into California. Is there any change that we should be aware of in thought process around new store productivity or particular cadence of NSP? Thanks a lot.	Joel Anderson	Thanks, Paul. Usually I don’t like to get into the week-by-week, blow-by-blow inter quarters. Certainly several retailers have called out the tax shift and we saw that same shift happening. We planned for it and we think as the quarter finishes, that’s net neutral and have already seen the bounce back from that. Currently, we’re up against Easter from last year and really our Easter selling for 2017 kicks off here starting next week. Ken, comments on --	Ken Bull	Yes. Paul, on the new store productivity, we feel really good about our new store program in 2017. And from a productivity standpoint if you do the math on the guidance that I’m providing for Q1 and the full year, those productivities are north of 90%, so at the high-end of our guidance. So I think it echo’s the confidence we have going into 2017 with the new stores. And then you had a question around the cadence of the stores, pretty similar in 2017 versus 2016. We expect to open about 60% of our stores in the first half of the year which is about what we did last year, and in the back half obviously 40%. So that should be pretty similar year-over-year.	Joel Anderson	Great summary, Ken. And I would echo what Ken said, Paul, still no change in new store productivity and are equally excited about this class that’s coming up here as we get the year kicked off.	Operator	We’ll next go to Michael Lasser with UBS.	Michael Goldsmith	Good afternoon. It’s Michael Goldsmith on for Michael Lasser today. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the new store openings. You mentioned you’re focusing on existing markets with the exception of the openings in California. Is there going to be any expected cannibalization that should impact the comp in any way that’s been different than past years? Thank you.	Joel Anderson	Thanks, Michael. No. We certainly look at cannibalization as we approve market-by-market and we don’t expect the cannibalization percent to be materially different in 2017 than it’s been in 2016. Remember, we see a 2,000-store opportunity out there. We only just crossed the 500 and really believe that there’s a lot of open space within our existing markets that we need to turn our attention to and begin to densify. But no expected change in cannibalization rates from prior years. Thanks, Michael.	Operator	We’ll next go to Jeremy Hamblin with Dougherty & Company.	Jeremy Hamblin	Congratulations guys on another great year. Wanted to just get into e-commerce a little bit and you mentioned that you were very pleased with the initial results. Wanted to get a sense of first, how many SKUs that you’re offering online at this point versus what you might typically see in a store? And then secondly, if you can give us a sense of potential magnitude of impact this year for the full year versus what you saw from August through the end of last year just to give us a sense of how much you expect that business to grow this year? Thanks.	Joel Anderson	Thanks, Jeremy. As I said in my prepared remarks, we soft launched in August and our main focus of our launch of e-commerce is really to get our initial platform out there, have a successful holiday season, get an initial set of SKUs out there. And I can honestly say we checked the box of success on all those initiatives. It was a great first year online. We’re fortunately in a position that we can approach e-commerce from an offensive standpoint not a defensive standpoint, meaning we can build it out with the right amount of pace and diligence rather than having to go excessively fast to play catch-up. I’ve always said that I believe e-commerce is the icing on the cake. Our stores are still the cake and we’re very excited about our new store growth and hence 100 new stores this year and we’ll continue to be the main driver of our growth. As far as the year goes, we’ll continue to add new features, optimize our SKU count. We’re still at a very small percent of what you see in our stores. We currently don’t ship to California as an example. And with our launch into California we’ll expand our e-commerce reach into California. And yet at the same time we don’t expect it to have a material impact on our overall sales for 2017.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll next go to Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs.	Stephen Tanal	Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just touch on a little bit on the guidance for the comp. A lot of obviously sort of negative data points on retail traffic and you guys are generally bucking the trend. But I wonder if you could comment on traffic specifically and how that’s trending and how you think that will – how that will play out in 2017? And then just a follow-up on e-commerce, if you could just tell us what the sales were in the quarter, that would be great? Thanks.	Joel Anderson	I’ll take the second one and Ken will comment on traffic. Currently, we haven’t disclosed the sales on e-commerce and I would tell you they’re not material and are still small in the overall piece from a materiality standpoint.	Ken Bull	I think Stephen you had a question around traffic, looking at traffic going forward although I’d just make a comment in terms of again what we saw in 2016 in the fourth quarter and then the full year I noted the comps that we achieved were driven by average ticket. We did see an improvement in comp transactions as we moved through the year being at a lower point in Q3 and we improved in Q4 where it was relatively flat and was similar for the full year. As we move forward into 2017, we don’t guide to any type of transactions or average ticket around that but we did make the comment around the guidance of our comps. You noticed us kind of stretching that guidance out a little bit as we’ve gotten larger we feel is the prudent thing to do in terms of the low-single digits. But at this stage, I can’t comment or estimate or forecast specifically transactions embedded with those guided comps.	Ken Bull	Yes, I would just add. We really saw Q3 as the high watermark of the negative traffic and saw a nice rebound in Q4 and would expect that to continue to moderate as we finish the peak of the trends from '15 and '16.	Operator	Let’s go to Dan Binder with Jefferies.	Dolph Warburton	Hi. This is Dolph Warburton on for Dan. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions revolve around the TV advertising program. I might have missed it, but do you guys have an estimate for how much TV ads might have added to comps in the quarter?	Ken Bull	No, we didn’t. You didn’t miss that. We haven’t broken that out. What I would share with you is that we increased TV in 2016 from 2015 from about 25% of our stores to 40% of our stores. We continue to think TV is very important to the overall marketing mix and you should expect to see us continue to invest in TV in both Q2 where we’re still doing some testing but expand it in Q4 of 2017. But it’s an important mix of our overall marketing going forward for sure.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll take the next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.	John Heinbockel	So, Joel, on real estate, given what’s going on with retail, what’s happening to the quality of the sites you’re looking at and the cost, right? So is rent flattening out or maybe even going down? And then when you densify how close – and I know it varies by how urban the market is. But how close do you find you’re able to put stores? And then what’s kind of the max cannibalization you think is acceptable, right, to try to drive brand awareness?	Joel Anderson	Yes, a lot in there on real estate, John, so let me try and tackle all those. What was the first part of it? It was --	John Heinbockel	Quality and cost of real estate.	Joel Anderson	Yes, quality. I would tell you overall the quality continues to get better, John. We are a desired tenant and as much as retailers are struggling and there have been several closings, landlords want vibrant centers. And we bring both an A balance sheet and we also bring traffic. We bring vibrant young traffic. And so – whereas in the past landlords didn’t know us. Today they know us and I think we are one of the first they call when they’re thinking about a new center, thinking about redeveloping the center. So if anything, we had more access to better centers than we have in the past. So I feel very good about the quality. And then the cost standpoint, Ken you want to comment.	Ken Bull	Sure, and you mentioned it, John, that would depend on the locations we’re in metro versus non-metro. But on an overall basis, we haven’t seen a material change in the overall rental rate from what we’ve seen in the recent past. So they’ve been relatively flat for us.	Joel Anderson	Yes. And then I think on cannibalization, John, you almost answered yourself. It really depends but the best I can do is just give you a proxy and the proxy would be Philadelphia. So here’s our home city where we’ve started nearly 15 years ago and yet this past year we opened four more stores, some of those honestly within two miles of existing stores. So as our awareness continues to build in top of mind strength of the brand, we haven’t reached a point yet of saturation even in our home market of Philadelphia from that perspective.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll next go to Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research Group.	Kelly Halsor	Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on gross margin. How should we expect that to trend given last year I think at least early on you’re benefiting from lower freight costs and maybe some lower gas prices? And then as we got into the fourth quarter, you didn’t really call that out on improved merchandize margins on shrink and then leverage on DC. Should that continue into '17? And then my second question is I just want to gauge again kind of your confidence around the 1Q guidance given the choppiness we’re seeing in the retail environment and timing of Easter this year versus last. I assume Easter is the most significant selling period in the quarter. Thank you.	Ken Bull	Thanks, Kelly. On the gross margin you mentioned, we did call out in the fourth quarter the improvement we saw there again driven by merchandize shrink improvement which I really see that as more of a one-time. We made investments over the last 18 months in loss prevention and other systems that has really helped us in that area. So I don’t see that ongoing, more of a one-time improvement we saw there. And then the leverage that we saw in distribution specifically around our new DC in Pedricktown, again that was one where a significant improvement we saw versus the prior holiday season remembering that that was really their first holiday season in 2015. So again don’t expect to see a significant amount of leverage in go-forward from the distribution center. And just on an overall basis in 2017, we would expect as I mentioned to see relatively flat operating margins with at the midpoint of our range that we provided for guidance that we wouldn’t see anything significant either on the gross margin line or on the SG&A line.	Joel Anderson	And then on sales for Q1, I think I shared some of the headwinds in the early quarter that are kind of behind us. I would just remind you Kelly and everybody that 90% of our sales come from new stores. And I think what you should expect to see from us is a widening of our comp guidance both in the quarters and the year. And if you just take the midpoints of our Q1 guidance and our full year guidance, what it should signal to you is we have confidence in our comps improving as we cycle the steepest of the trends from prior years.	Operator	We’ll next go to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.	Alan Rifkin	Thank you very much. It was mentioned that the deleverage on the operating margin line in Q1 I believe is going to be due in part to the nine stores opening up in LA. If you could just confirm that all of the operating margin deleverage would be attributed to that? And at what point do you believe you’ll break even with respect to store openings? By the time you get to '17 openings by the end of the year, do you think that gives you critical mass or it will be some point in 2018 that you’ll achieve it? Thank you.	Ken Bull	Alan, I’ll reiterate for Q1 the delever in operating margin coming from really two things. One, the lower comp on last year’s very high comp in 2016 first quarter. And then it’s that also we’re seeing some deleverage around the California stores because of the timing of their opening, literally opening at the end of April, the end of the quarter. So it’s the combination of those two things that’s driving the delever in Q1. But in terms of our new store openings in California and all the other stores for the rest of the year that’s going to be very similar to what we’ve seen in the past. There’s no specific delever coming out of that at all. We expect to see productivity again greater than 90% throughout the year. And then performance from a contribution standpoint very similar to what we’ve seen as a class coming out of other classes historically. So no impact as we move forward through the year.	Joel Anderson	And I’ll just reiterate. California specifically, we expect those stores to still perform at the same level as the chain in terms of less than a one year payback. So there is no extended breakeven that’s any different than the rest of our chain. We’re very excited about California. We like the sites we’re in and the teams ready to go out there. But there’s no drag post once we get them open.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll next go to Sean Kras with Barclays.	Sean Kras	Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a bit of a follow up to an earlier question. But can you talk about the difference in comps between markets where TV advertising was new in the fourth quarter compared to markets where you were lapping TV advertising? And also can you give us some color on what aspects of the Michigan test stores you’re going to be incorporating into new stores this year?	Joel Anderson	Say that last part again, what aspects?	Sean Kras	I just wanted aspects of the Michigan test store that you’re going to be incorporating into the new stores this year.	Joel Anderson	Yes, if you happen to have been in the Michigan test store, you should expect relatively everything you saw in that store to be incorporated into the 2017 class of stores. And then the second part of your question was --	Sean Kras	TV.	Joel Anderson	TV, sorry. Sorry, it was two different topics there. Sean, as far as TV goes, our new store TV stores performed significantly in line with the way they did in 2015 which means high-single digit and we’re excited with TV. We think it’s an important way to grow brand awareness, grow top of mind, hence why you saw us grow from 25% to 40% and should expect us to continue to grow that next year as well in fourth quarter.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll next go to Alvin Concepcion with Citi.	Alvin Concepcion	Thanks for taking my question as well. Just a couple questions on the California rollout. It’s your largest growth opportunity over time, so I’m wondering how many units do you think you can get to ultimately? And if you could talk about your go-to-market strategy, any changes in your approach there versus other key markets that are important for us to think about?	Joel Anderson	Our go-to-market strategy in California you’re talking about?	Alvin Concepcion	That’s right.	Joel Anderson	We easily see California over time being north of a couple hundred stores. It will easily be our largest state. As far as our go-to-market strategy as it relates to 2017, we are going to solely concentrate on the Greater LA basin and then expand from there going into '18 and beyond probably with San Diego being the next place we’d focus. But we’re starting in Southern California. To remind everybody, this is the same strategy we’ve taken from when we went into Texas, went into Chicago, when we went into Florida. In Texas we started in Dallas then we moved to Houston, over to San Antonio, Austin area. In Florida, we started in Northern Florida then moved into Southern Florida. Chicago is an example, we leapt forward to Chicago and then build back into other states. So we’ve employed this strategy several times prior and this is the exact same strategy we’re going to take as we enter California. I’d add from a personal note, I’m born and raised in California. This is a state I know and love well and we’re really excited to get going in Southern California. So it’s going to be a great opening for us next month.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll go to Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.	Brad Thomas	Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about sourcing and how much some of your direct purchases and foreign purchases increased during 2016 and how that will evolve in 2017. And if you could maybe contextualize how much of a tailwind that’s been for you to reinvest in the product and the value in your stores. Thank you.	Joel Anderson	Yes, 2016 our imports were relatively flat to 2015 and we’d expect it to stay in that relative range going into '17. And I think with every product we consider both domestic as well as imports as to what makes the most sense. But in all cases, our goal is to deliver wow and newness to our customers with a focus on quality and exceptional price. So it’s really a balance between both our import and our domestic strategies.	Operator	Thank you. We have a question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.	Vincent Sinisi	Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the advertising strategy just kind of overall. And I guess kind of two parts, with certainly TV continuing to become a part of the mix. This year versus last year, does that – I don’t know if you have any comments on where that kind of 40% of stores could go this year. And then I guess kind of what works best with TV specifically. But when you think of all the different mediums, I guess the second part of the question is any changes to the marketing budget kind of as a percent of sales overall? Thanks very much.	Joel Anderson	We certainly haven’t spelled out specifically what percent that will go to in '17. But as you can tell from our real estate strategy and the desire to densify some of our existing markets, we’re obviously aligning all our strategies around the goal of getting to a level of store count in each perspective market that we can add TV to it. You have to have a certain amount of density. It certainly changes market-by-market of what that number is. But you can tell by the strategy we’re employing that TV is important to us and we want to get to a point where we can deploy that to more markets. So expect to go up and certainly as we nail down the numbers in respective quarters going forward, we’ll share that with you. As far as marketing, we continue to see marketing on a rate basis relatively flat year-over-year. It might be up just a little this year. On a dollars perspective, it grows significantly. So as our growth is in the 20% rate, the dollars grow substantially and would continue to get leverage as we add more stores into existing markets. But we like where we’re heading with marketing. We’re excited about our top of mind and brand awareness strategies and we’ll continue to deploy those going forward here.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll take a question from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.	Patrick McKeever	Thank you. Just a question on wages and any potential wage pressures you might be seeing with a good number of retailers raising wages both at the store manager level and also for store associates. And then a second question is on just thinking about a potential border adjusted or adjustment or whatever it’s called tax. And what the impact might be on your business if that were to go through given the high percentage of imported merchandize and also the $5 price point ceiling?	Joel Anderson	Sure. A lot in there, Patrick. Certainly wages, there was some FLSA pressure last year that moderated. I think we called that out about a penny. There’s the minimum wage increases that are baked into our '17 forecast and we called those out at about a penny for this year. And we’ll continue to call those out as they go forward from that perspective. And then as far as the border adjustment tax, what I would allude to there is this is a retail-wide industry issue. We’re really monitoring the discussions and it’s too early to kind of speculate on the extent of what those tax impacts would be on us specifically. There’s been a lot of ideas out there; some actually help us and there’s been some talk about excluding low price points, some obviously would have an impact on us and I think we’ve got to wait honestly Patrick until there is some legislation out there that we can kind of benchmark against exactly. But a lot of movement on that. Rest assured not only us but the entire retail industry is watching this and quite honestly lobbying for retail on it. Ken, anything to add?	Ken Bull	No. I think you hit it. Just with regards to the border tax, we would expect that that will be part of some broader tax reform. And to Joel’s point there, could be other benefits to be able to offset that. So that’s why it’s difficult to speculate at this time on what it would be standalone versus some of the other things that have been put out there in legislation around capital expenditure deductions, overall corporate income tax deductions, things like that. So we’re obviously staying on top of the situation and then we’ll react accordingly when we get some more clarity.	Operator	We’ll take a question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.	Brian Nagel	Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.	Joel Anderson	Go ahead, Brian.	Brian Nagel	I wanted to ask just on the California opening. So there’s been a lot of discussion here you’ve discussed previously. And as you’ve said in the past, you’ve made big pushes into other markets. Are there unique challenges as you look and explore California and you begin to move in, are there other unique challenges that you’ll see in California that you do not see in some of these other markets?	Joel Anderson	Sure. Certainly there are and I think it’s part of the reason we announced our entry into California so long ago. Certainly there are differences in regulatory, there are differences in labor laws and we spent the last year preparing for that, making sure our product meets all the requirements. And I can tell you the teams done an outstanding job and we’re ready to go. As I said, all the teams are hired. The training is taking place. The product meets all the official regulatory invoices. But besides those two, we from a business standpoint as I alluded to in some of the earlier questions, we expect California to perform much like the rest of our chain does. We have an experience with markets like California. I alluded to Northern Jersey and Long Island as examples there where we’ve been very successful.	Operator	Thank you. We’ll take a follow-up question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG.	Alan Rifkin	Thank you very much. For the 40% of your stores that were supported by TV, can you shed some color on the comp performance or the revenue performance or traffic or profitability of that group of stores compared to the stores that were not supported through TV advertising? Thanks. And then will let you go.	Joel Anderson	Thanks, Alan. It’s a part that we haven’t broke out in the fourth quarter. I did share that new stores have performed in the high-single digits in comp. And I think you can tell by the comments I made of expanding TV in 2017, we believe it’s an important mix for us in terms of not only helping brand awareness but also helping top of mind and keeping Five Below at the forefront of customers’ minds when they’re thinking about shopping. But we haven’t broken it out specifically from that perspective.	Operator	Thank you. That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back to management for any additional closing remarks.	Joel Anderson	Thank you, operator. Thanks everybody for joining today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. We’re excited about 2017. Have a great evening. Thank you.	Operator	That concludes today’s conference and thank you for your participation.	Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

4,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX),RIO,2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,"March 22, 2017 01:00 PM ET","Executives	Howard Schultz - Chairman and CEO	Kevin Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer	Gerri Martin-Flickinger - Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer	Molly Liu - VP of Digital Ventures, China	Leon Bridges - Artist/Singer	Lucy Helm - Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary	Analysts	Jan Drago - Shareholder	Justin Danhof - National Center for Public Policy Research	Howard Schultz	Good morning. And welcome to the Starbucks’ Annual Meeting of our Shareholders, our 25th as a public Company. And as you now know my last as CEO. Let me begin by thanking the Seattle Recruiting Battalion color guard representing United States Army and the Starbucks’ quire, please given them a nice round of applause.	There are a number of important guests I’d just to acknowledge and recognize. Our entire Board is here this morning. We’ll introduce them formally in a little while. But I would like to introduce and recognize our three new Directors and ask them to stand. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft; Rosalind Brewer, the former CEO and President Sam’s Club; and Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the Head of the LEGO Group. We had a Board meeting yesterday and Board dinner, and they weren’t shy, they were right in there. And the three of you are going to add so much value to the Company. Thank you very much for becoming part of Starbucks family. Thank you.	27 years ago, when a young brash kid from New York was trying to raise money for a coffee company that was not succeeding in Chicago, people did not pronounced the Italian names in our menu. Not a lot of people were willing to invest in our Company, and 27 years ago one venture capital stood up and he is retiring from the Starbucks floor after 27 years. I want to say thank you and really recognize with great respect and admiration, Jamie Shennan.	I know we have a number of business partners internationally are here, Plácido Arango from Spain; Alberto and Paulino Torrado from Mexico, Noey Lopez from the Philippines, Rocco Princi from Italy. Thank you for being here. It means a lot that you’ve travelled all this way. Thank you. And I would like to ask all service members, veterans, military spouses to stand up and be recognized. Thank you.	And to all the Starbucks partners who are here today and the thousands who are watching on the webcast from 75 countries, everything we do is for you and what we’ve tried over the years has really demonstrated the compassion of our Company, and our shareholders are here to applaud and salute all of you who wear the green apron. Thank you so much. Thank you.	And last, thank you. My wife Sherry is not here tonight, today. Two weeks early, our grandson arrived on Sunday. She is back in New York. 25 years, no one can do anything like this alone, all the families that represent our partners and my wife Sherry and our kids, they all know that I stand on their shoulders and I am here because of them. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sherry.	Okay. Those were the thank you’s. So let’s begin. Every hour of every day someone somewhere, everywhere in the world, is walking into a place named Starbucks. And as we gather here today, there’re over 26,000 stores in 75 countries, and last week alone, over 90 million customers pass-through our stores. And we now employ over 330,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron somewhere in the world.	From the very beginning, we said that we’re in business for a number of reasons, but we’re also in business to create value for our people. And I want to share with you, after 25 years of being a public company, I think what we’re most proud of is the unbelievable commitment and conviction we had to our partners and their families. And as we go forward, not only are we trying to build shareholder value for you but at the same time we take it very seriously the conviction we have, to make sure that we share success with our people and bring our families along with us. So, for all the partners who’re watching, as I said earlier, make no mistake about it. We believe shareholder value for value for our partners and that has made the Starbucks experience so special after all these years.	Now 25 years ago, in 1992, it’s hard to believe this little coffee company was about 150 stores, and only one quarter of profitability was getting ready to go public. And of course, in Seattle and on the West Coast, there was great fanfare about what Starbucks could accomplish. But as we went on the road show and tried to talk about the Starbucks story, there was resistance. And interestingly enough, there wasn’t much resistance about whether or not what we do every day in our stores was going to transfer to other markets. The resistance came because two years before the IPO, we had the novel idea at a time to recognize that for us to succeed as a company we had to exceed the expectations of our people, so that they could exceed the expectations of our customers. In a way, that manifested itself is we became the first company in America to provide equity in the form of stock options and comprehensive health insurance, in 1990, to everyone that worked at Starbucks, including those people who were working 20 hours a week, part time people. And that became the foundation of the culture of the Company.	But the shareholders who were looking at investing in a public company, a retail public company, many of whom made the decision in the conclusion that those benefits and the generosity of the Company, the benevolence of Starbucks management at the time, that these benefits would be shareholder dilutive; in a sense that it would not create value as much as it could if we gave that money back to the shareholders. Now that was a very important moment because it imprinted in all of us the conviction we had then as we do now in recognizing that it’s not about the healthcare, it’s not about the equity in the form of stock options, it’s about creating the balance that we’ve always believed-in in creating long-term value for the shareholder, profit in everything we do, but at the same time, recognizing the importance of the fragile balance, of social impact, conscience, benevolence and serving the communities and serving our people.	So, as we look back on the 25-year public history of the Company and how others viewed us then and how they view us now; what we’ve accomplished in terms of the record financial performance, is just about unparallel. I mean when you look at this slide, it’s hard to believe that a small coffee company in 1992 that had a 150 stores and a market cap of $250 million of the IPO is sitting today with a market cap of over $80 billion. And if you were smart enough to hold on to your stock, Jack I know you were. And you invested a $1,000 in 1992 that investment is worth over $180,000 today, we’re pretty proud of that. But not many people believe, so there’re shareholders here today, I see them friends of mine; Jack and Nancy Rogers, Carole Bovoso, Steven Lorry Rick. These are people who were kind of friends of mine in those early days who really, really believed that we could build a different kind of company.	So, I think that as we think about what’s really important and what has driven the success; and as I stand here before you, of course, it’s the quality of the coffee the store design and everything; but it’s the culture; it’s the values. And as a result of that, we have been recognized, time-and-time again, as having one of the most respected and recognized brands in the world. And just last week, the equity of the Starbucks brand was once again recognized. For the 11th consecutive year, Starbucks was named one of the world’s most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere Institute and then Fortune Magazine, which does its study every year named Starbucks the third most admired company in the world.	I mean, Scotty, I’m glad that you’re on that list, I got to say. But, when I was the kid growing up, GE was everything and I look at Starbucks on the same list as GE. I just -- I can only wish my parents were here to really understand what Starbucks has become. So, we’re very proud of that as a Company, very proud of that personally.	So, you look at the financial performance which has been extraordinary. And here I am in front of you in the year where it’s been an anomaly for Starbucks, because it’s one of the few years in our public life where the stock is not up year-over-year. And of course, the favors are out for Howard and something is wrong, we got mobile order and pay issue, and is congestion and we have analysts who believe maybe the bloom is off the rose at Starbucks. They don’t know what you’re talking about.	So, even though the stock is not up year-over-year, if you ask me to assess this past year, putting the stock prices aside for a moment, I’d honestly say and I believe this, this probably has been one of our best, most strongest most meaningful years, in our history. And let me tell you why; one is, we’ve always taken the long view. We’ve always tried to invest ahead of the growth curve. We’ve always recognized that success is best when its shared, bringing up people along on the journey and investing in the communities in which we operate; never succumbing to short-term pressures and the mentality of others, but being true to the long-term aspirations of building a great and enduring company.	Now, two years ago when I stood on this stage, I framed a very important question that was heartfelt, it’s was personal, and something that I was very concerned about. And that was, what is the role and responsibility for a poor profit company. If you think back two years ago and where we are today, I think that question and the answers to that question are more important than ever before. So, it begs a number of questions. For example, why are we opening up stores in Fergusson, Missouri, Inglewood outside of Chicago, Jamaica Queens? Why did we convene over 40 likeminded companies to try and hire 1 million opportunity use among the 5 million young people, ages 16 to 24, mostly African-American and Latino, who are not in school and not in work. Why will we do that? Why have we hired 10,000 veterans and their spouses? Why have we opened over 30 family military stores near basis around the country? Why were we one of the first companies in America to support marriage equality? And why are we the only Company in America providing three, four year tuition for every single person at Starbucks? Why are we doing that? Why do we host an annual meeting in China for the parents and the families of Chinese partners? Why do we do anything quite like that? Why did we have the courage, the conviction, to address the issue of race and try and elevate the national conversation about racism? And yes, why did we make the announcement, just a few weeks ago, to hire 10,000 refugees globally?	And the answer, for me personally and everyone that works with me, is pretty simple. Not every decision in business is an economic one, and because leadership and moral courage is not a passive act. Because since 1971 when we opened the first store in a tight place market and again in 1992 when we went public from Seattle to Mumbai, from Shanghai to Paris, Starbucks has succeeded because of our people, because we recognize what our responsibility is in addition to making a profit. It’s also a reminder that these investments and levels of innovation are not only marketing and customer facing, they are about conscience. And we have, for decades, been driven by principles, guided by a set of beliefs that are skit in humanity. That is the role and responsibility of a public company. And I think a great way to demonstrate that to you is just a short, a very short video that we put together that’s not marketing and not about a press release, it’s literally about the compassion of the Company. Take a look.	So, I can assure you that our commitment to building long term value for you, our shareholders going forward, is an absolute. But looking ahead, we’re going to advance this work even more boldly in the years to come. Three years ago, we said we’d hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by 2018. I’m proud to announce that we’ve already met and exceeded that goal. And let me just say something about that that I think is important. So much was written, as veterans were coming home and trying to make the transition from military life to civilian life, we sat down with a group of young people who are getting ready for the transition. And I heard one of them make the comment that I’ll never forget; when he said that he had more anxiety and trepidation about going to a job interview than he had about going back to Afghanistan. Think about that.	And unfortunately, so many people who are coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq were misrepresented about who they were and what they’ve done. These are extraordinary people who’ve been through extraordinary things; they come back with skills, leadership, ethics, integrity; not an ounce of entitlement. And everyone of them that has come to work at Starbucks in our office wearing the green apron on their own merit have done a great job, but they have made us a better company, we are better because of them.	And so we’re upping our goal and we’re going to hire 25,000 by 2025. And that’s not all. Two years ago, we made a commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth at Starbucks. We’ve exceeded that goal and we have 40,000 now. We’ve held jobs there in Seattle, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles; and let’s look into that photo. This photo here, this is like 8 AM in Los Angeles. We open the doors to our job-fair and these young kids, you can see how they’re dressed, you can see their facial expressions, they’re running into the door and all they’re looking for is one thing and that is that that their station in live should not to find them, and all their looking for is an opportunity. And just like the variance that we’ve hired, these young people have done extraordinary things at Starbucks and all they’re looking for is for someone to open up the door and to view them on their own nerve. So, we’re upping our goal for opportunity youth and we’ll try and higher 100,000 by 2020.	And finally building on our Starbucks College Achievement program with the partnership with Arizona State University; we’ve created a new program, which is called pathway to admission. And that basically opens access to college to every Starbucks partner who previously did not qualify for college for one reason or another. So regardless of your test stores, regardless of your history, everyone at Starbucks is now going to have access to a three-four year college tuition, and we hope to have 25,000 partners graduate from ASU by 2025.	So, as I mentioned, this is my last Annual Meeting as the CEO of Starbucks. And the question has been what is going to be my role responsibility going forward, as Executive Chairman. And I will be focusing a majority of my efforts on the new area of the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand and retail innovation. So, two years ago, we began this program, and with the Reserve brand. And we had an unbelievable success with the Seattle Roastery. But I just want to take you back to something.	In 2008-2009 as we were having this trouble. I wrote down this little private story to myself. I wasn’t clairvoyant, but I was dreaming about something. And the dream was, could we create a different immersive theatrical romantic flagship experience that do not exists, not only in coffee but anywhere. Could we take the elements of Disney and Willy Wonka and do something that would just be dream like? Can we take our customers on a magical carpet ride? Well, the Seattle Roastery has done just that and more. And we are now on our way to a whole new level of expansion and opportunities with the Roastery.	Beginning with the fact that we discovered an extraordinary artisanal baker in Milan, and that’s Rocco Princi who is here today. I tried to convince him for like seven years to be our partner, and he kept saying no; he operates five stores in Milan and one in London, kept saying no, no, no. I thought we had a language because he doesn’t speak English. I don’t speak Italian. But we both spoke the language of love. And I got him to Seattle I took him into the Roastery. And this fall, we will be bringing Princi Food fresh cake, which we’re actually baking into the Roastery and we’ll bring Princi into all of the roasteries going forward.	So if we look at this map. So go back please; so the Seattle Roastery far left; Princi Food on the left; this is New York on the corner of 9th and 15th in the Meatpacking District next to the Chelsea market across from Google; next to Apple; this is under construction. Shanghai, which will be almost twice the size of the Seattle two levels in a location we can only dream about on NanJing Road, will open up in December; you’re all invited. And the crown jewel of it all is then my lifelong dream since I walked the streets of Milan in 1983 to one day open in Milan. And we decided we just can’t open up a store, we have to open Roastery. So, last week we were in Milan making the announcement and take a look.	That was an extraordinary moment for all of us and for me personally. When that Roastery opens in Italy and about a year and a half, it will be a seminal moment for the Company, for me and going back to ‘83, who could have possibly imagined that we would be here celebrating 25 years as a public company. So as I said before, we’ve tried from day-one to play the long game. I can’t imagine to be surrounded a more talented committed, compassionate team of senior leaders at Starbucks, and now led by one person, Kevin Johnson.	So, let me tell you a little bit about Kevin, and why I’m so enthused, why I’m so confident, and why our shareholders, you should feel very, very comfortable that the company is in extraordinary hands with a great person and a great leader. I’ve worked side-by-side with Kevin the last two years when he’s been President and COO of Starbucks. And six years prior to that, he served with great distinction as outside Board member. And certainly, everyone on the Board would agree with that.	Who is Kevin Johnson? Above all else, he’s a serving leader with tremendous sense of humanity, compassion and an understanding, a deep understanding, of the human condition. He’s been labeled, maybe fairly and unfairly at times, as a technologist. I mean that maybe his avocation. But he’s an extraordinary person who has a great understanding of Starbucks’ business, what it means to be a merchant, and above all else, the partner experience. So, we thought a great way to introduce Kevin before he comes on stage is just to give you a glimpse into Kevin, his life and the man. Take a look.	Please welcome the next Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks Coffee Company, Kevin Johnson.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone. This is my 8th Annual Shareholder Meeting, and this is very special one for me. Certainly, it’s the opportunity to recognize and celebrate what Howard and hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners throughout the years has created. Now, my life’s journey has taken me to this place here today. As a young boy, the mission of sending a man to the moon captivated me. It always began with the bold aspiration and a mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one-cup, one neighborhood at a time.	How many publicly traded companies do you know that have a mission statement that begins with the words to inspire and nurture the human spirit? Only one I know. And that’s why Starbucks hold a special place in my heart. Every life experience I’ve had, every achievement, every struggle, every lesson learned, every person that touched, has shaped me and Starbucks has shaped me. And I could tell you, I am prepared to do the hard work with a taste to elevate this great brand, and Starbucks lead us into the future. And I am so optimistic, so optimistic, about the future for three reasons.	Three reasons that I think are relevant to all shareholders; first, human connection. Starbucks is in the business of human connection in a world that needs it now more than ever; second, relevant innovation. We have the strongest innovation pipeline in the history of the Company; and third China. China is our fastest growing market and represents an amazing opportunity. Now, let me take you through each one of these reasons in more detail, and then I’m going to connect them back together to our commitment to creating to shareholder value.	Human connection, Starbucks partners around the world connect with over 90 million customers a week. The concept of the third place is universally accepted as a gathering place for community, a place for people to connect. Communities embrace their local Starbucks as a hub, and this was so evident to me a year ago. A year ago, I attended the store opening in Ferguson, Missouri. Certainly, following the unrests the protests and that riots that unfolded in Ferguson in 2014, we decide to build a Starbucks store in support of the community of Ferguson. When we announced we’re putting a store in Ferguson, the young man Cordell Lewis, heard about Starbucks coming to Ferguson and he applied to be the store manager and we hired Cordell. Cordell Lewis is here today let’s give a hand for Cordell.	Now, when I arrived to that store, Cordell has hired just a wonderful team [indiscernible], some were 10 years Starbucks partners and some, it was their very first job. On the day of the opening, community leaders, leaders from the urban league, the Mayor, the City Council, Police Officers and citizens of Ferguson, showed up for that store opening with excitement, optimism, about their community. Every person was there, was proud to be able to say that Ferguson would now have a Starbucks. It was a vote of confidence for their community. Now, I listen to these customers, I listen to our partners that day in Ferguson and I observed something; I observed a sense of connection; a desire to come together; and a feeling of joy.	Now, the week prior to the store opening, Howard was in South Africa, opening our first Starbucks store in South Africa. And when we got back to Seattle, we sat down in Howard’s office and we shared our experiences; two store openings in very different places, different hemispheres, different continents, but with the same similar sentiment from customers and partners; pride, community and joy. And I asked myself, why is this that people almost 10,000 miles apart, different hemispheres, different continents, but they have the same reaction, why; the answer, human connection.	Now, following that visit, a few months later, I was reading an article in Fortune Magazine. And the first paragraph of that article captured, it’s that humans were not designed to these solitary creatures. We evolve to survive in tribes the need to interact is still deeply ingrained in our genetic codes, so much so that the absence of social connection triggers the same primal alarm bells as thirst, hunger and pain, wow. So, I look, and the quote was from a leading researcher on human connection from the University of Chicago, John Cacioppo. So what did I do? I picked up the phone and I call the University of Chicago switchboard and I asked to speak to John.	And he took my call; I said John, my name is Kevin; I’m at Starbucks; I want to learn more about your research around human connection. And John spent an hour educating me on his studies around what he believes is a modern-day epidemic of chronic loneliness. And he shared with me, he said Kevin, I think in my research it points to three factors, or at least three factors. He said, for example, the rise of technology, often-times people are spending more time in their device then they’re connecting with another human being. He said, growing division in the world causes people to turn inward. And he said, in periods of economic struggle, people have to spend more time working and less time with family. The antidote he says, human connection. Well, that is the business of Starbucks. There are so many great stories of our partners connecting with customers in meaningful ways that changes their lives. And I just picked one to share with you today, a small video.	Human connection, it happens every day in 26,000 stores around the world. It is our foundation and it is a strong foundation. But we’re also innovators. We’re driving relevant innovation for our customers that amplifies Starbucks as a destination, and our innovation pipeline is the strongest in the history of the Company; beverage, food, store design, equipment, digital, every aspect of innovation that it takes to create customer experiences that are joyful.	Now, let’s start with coffee innovation. Starbucks Reserve has created the renaissance of small-lot coffees; two examples, Eastern Congo. Our work with Eastern Congo initiatives is rebuilding the country’s coffee industry. They are now producing coffee that is a customer favorite with its lively orange citrus flavor and notes of cocoa. Pantheon Blend is a one of the kind blend, made up from Reserve coffees from Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Guatemala. When it comes to coffee beverages, the Roastery in Seattle has now become our innovation incubator. Beverages like Cascara Latte were invented in the Roastery and are now part of our core Starbucks beverage offerings across the entire footprint; the latest innovation from the Roastery, Barrel-Aged Coffee. Take a look.	That’s the Roastery today. Now, these are just two examples of many where the Roastery is fueling innovation that will propagate throughout the Starbucks fleet.	Now, let’s move on to tea, and tea innovation. Today, we sell over $1 billion of Teavana teas in Starbucks stores around the world. And we look to our customers; customers care about wellness; they care about natural ingredients; they are working find ways to reduce calories and no added sugars. So later this summer, we are introducing new Teavana shaken iced tea infusions. Shaken iced tea infusions take our freshly seeped core Teavana teas and we combine them with freshly seeped flavors that come from fruit and botanical blend that deliver the delicious flavored beverage that are free from artificial flavors and sweeteners.	Now, we are reducing the added sugars in all of our standard tea beverages and you can request them un-sweet. Teavana iced tea infusions delicious unsweetened at zero grams of added sugar, a great, great beverage. Food innovation; let me highlight some of the work we’re doing in the areas of food. We recently launched the new Sous Vide Egg Bites in January, and I can tell you, they are hit when you can find them. We are adding capacity as fast as we can to not only catch up but keep up with customer demand. Now, we’ve also listen to customer feedback of around more gluten free choices, right?	Now, in fact at the last two Annual Shareholder Meetings, one of our shareholders, Mr. Kath, Mr. Kath has come to the microphone two years in a row during the Q&A session. And he made his request for more gluten free choices. Mr. Kath, are you here today? Okay. Mr. Kath, this one is for you. Yesterday, we launched another gluten free item on the menu, our Smoked Canadian Bacon Breakfast Sandwich with more gluten free innovation coming. Mr. Kath thanks for the feedback.	Now, let’s talk about much, another big opportunity for Starbucks. Now, last year, I sat down and met with our chef in the innovation lab and I asked him, I asked him to provide us with a culinary point of view for a wonderful lunch menu. And they went on in Discovery Journey. They came back from that Discovery Journey and I said Kevin here is an idea, what if we created a Mediterranean, Californian inspired culinary experience for lunch that is second to none. And I said what if we created a supply chain so we could be prepared fresh daily, prepared and consumed within a 24-hour period, so every item is fresh. And what if we had the range of options from high-protein offerings to vegan, and what if at the end of the day any of that food that was not sold through in that store was then donated to feed the hungry.	Introducing Starbucks Mercato; vibrant solid party sandwiches, all made fresh daily. Now, Mercato will be available in more than 100 stores in the Chicago area beginning in mid-April, just a few weeks delay. Based on the customer feedback and reception we’ll then plan to expand into other markets. Now, not only will Mercato, the Mercato lunch offerings in Starbucks provide you a wonderful lunch and selection, it also contributes to the positive mission of feeding the hungry through our food share program; Mercato, in stores in Chicago mid-April.	Now, digital, I got to talk about digital. Before we jump into the customer facing innovation coming from digital, I want to touch upon how we are using digital technologies internal to Starbucks to create a real-time connection with our store managers. When you think about it, just in U.S. we have over 9,000 Company-operated stores. And the question was posed, how can we better connect with our store managers; how can we communicate with them in the two way vehicle and do it fast; and how can we help store managers to create community amongst one another.	Well, in January, we implemented Workplace by Facebook. Now, think of Workplace by Facebook as a private Facebook for Starbucks partners to communicate and share information. Workplace allows us now to stream live open forums and have real-time dialogue with our store managers. We launched this thing in January with a live open forum hosted by Howard and myself with all store managers in the U.S. That’s what you see up here on the screen. This is actual live open forum in January. And you can see by this slide here, we are getting real-time comments, hearts, thumbs-up sometime a thumb down, mostly thumbs up. And store managers are asking us questions. Now, this was a new experience for both Howard and myself but we have now started doing these workplace live open forums with our stores managers, every month. And store managers have bounced on their way to create community, instead of connect with us.	So recent examples; about a month-ago, a store manager posted on Workplace; he posted a post that said, that they are selling more than 20 beverages a day that are not on our official beverage menu, they are beverages that were featured on Instagram. How many people use Instagram, get your beverage see all kinds of beverages on Instagram. Well they’re selling 20 a day they’re not truly have the right recipe. Well, within 24-hour period, nearly 40 other store managers also posted and said I too; I am selling 15 of these a day; I’m selling 30 of these a day.	And then that evening, our category marketing teams saw the volume of post and how much this beverage, featured on Instagram, was selling in our stores and they made a decision that night and posted back to store managers by the next morning that they had made the decision to add this to be official beverage recipes something that could have taken weeks if now months to happen before Workplace, happened in one day. That is creating visibility with our store managers that’s enabling us to have more velocity in the way we make decisions, so we can better serve our store managers and our partners in the stores.	All right, customer-facing digital; Mobile Order & Pay continues to grow, and just last month, it represented more than 8% of all transactions in the United States. And in our last earnings call, we highlighted how we are focusing on increasing throughput, improving the customer experience and reducing congestion at the hand-off plane. Now, we have already deployed a number of these measures, and they are having a positive effect.	For example, in our busiest stores, we’ve added two new dedicated roles for partners at that peak, just for Mobile Order & Pay. We streamlined a hand-off plane in the way that beverages are consolidated and given to our customers, and we’ve deployed new tools to support the increased throughput. Now, the early feedback from store managers and customers has been very positive. But keep in mind, these are just the first steps of a number of things we are doing to improve capacity and throughput in our store. And rest assured that this progress will continue to be fully felt in the back-half of this fiscal year.	Now, to show you some of the new innovation and the exciting new customer features that we are bringing to our mobile app, I want to introduce our Chief Technology Officer, Gerri Martin-Flickinger. Gerri?	Gerri Martin-Flickinger	Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to spend a few minutes with you today to talk a little bit about the digital innovation at Starbucks. At its core, Starbucks is all about the importance of human connection; one person one cup of coffee and one neighborhood at a time. I truly believe the technology when done well helps enrich and enhance the human connection. And over the last several years, we’ve innovated to make our mobile application even more personalized.	Let me start by taking you on the journey. We launched Starbucks mobile application three years ago, and we started this mobile payment, giving customers the ability to pay from their phone and track reward. It was less than two years ago that we enhanced this application to allow ordering and further extending our brick-and-mortar stores with added digital convenience. And this year, we extended this experience to make it personal. And let me explain how?	We leverage Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. We switch data from many different sources, including a customer’s past purchases, information about trend, weather data, as well as product availability at a store. And then we give each and every customer personalized offers and recommendations to anticipate and delight. And that’s not all. We also surprised customers with gains that are developed just for them, giving our customers rewards and opportunities to try new products or visit more frequently.	Like Kevin said, our customers have made it clear that these personalized experiences are enriching their connection to Starbucks. Starbucks reward members, the said is 20% higher than last year and we’ve seen a tripling personalized marketing sales lift, reflecting a more engaged member base. The growth in MOP has been impressive. Our highest volume MOP stores are seeing more than 20% of their transactions through MOP at peak. And as Kevin mentioned, with this volume we recognize the need to continue to streamline and enhance the in-store experience. We’re using and testing text notification to let customers know their orders are ready, allowing our customers time to relax and improving the experience at the hand-off plane. We’re also introducing technology to help abreast manage the production of orders, so they can focus on the customer engagement.	So, we’ve talked a lot about Mobile Order & Pay and the digital divide. But that’s only one form of interaction. Today, customers can even pay with an eye watch. And I’m sure we could all imagine many more devices and many more methods of digital engagement. And innovation continues to touch all of our lives. The way we interact with technology is also radically changing. I love to ask a question, how many of you took a typing class to learn to use a computer? Yes, I mean I see some hands out there. Okay. How many of you kids took typing? Yes, okay. So, if your kids are like my kids, they use one finger and they point and click. And I would suggest to you that the next generation won’t even do that, they will use their voice.	Earlier this year, we announced voice ordering in our mobile application. Let’s take a quick look at how this work. So this feature has already rolled out to about 100,000 customers, and we plan to have rolled out nationwide by the end of the year. As you can imagine, the opportunity for voice and other settings becomes quite intriguing. For example, we delivered and elect the skill that allows you to order coffee at home from your Amazon Echo. Our technology foundation is allowing us to embrace conversational commerce very, very rapidly. In fact, I’d like to give you a sneak-peek of something that I got a chance to see this morning.	So, what you just saw was real; available in market later this year for customers with the Alexa Skills, and Ford with Sync 3. So, it only takes a little imagination to think about where conversational ordering will show up next. But we’ll say the few things for next year’s shareholders meeting.	I’d to shift now to gifting. Over the years, giving and receiving Starbucks’ gift card has become iconic. They’re given for birthdays, holidays, thank you, business events or just because. Traditionally, our customers have purchased gift cards from our stores and other retailers, and now customers can also purchase them digitally in our MOP app or Web site. But what if we like gifting occur in other channels? What about social channels? The virtual places for you engage with your friends, your colleagues and loved ones every single day.	Earlier this year, we released an add-in for Microsoft Outlook 365, which many consumers and businesses use for email. The add-in allows you to get someone at Starbuck gift card without ever leaving your email session with just a few clicks. What an amazing way to quickly send a thank you or birthday gift. This spring we’ll release Starbucks gifting for iMessage. This will allow our customers to give a Starbucks Gift Card within an iMessage conversation on an iPhone or an iPad. Let me show you how this feature works.	In this example two co-workers are messaging one-another. One coworker wants to thank his colleague for job well-done. Without leaving the iMessage conversation, he’s able to select the gift card and pay with Apple Pay with just a few taps. The recipient can redeem the gift card right from their iPhone using Apple Pay. This will be released in April. And that’s just the beginning. We’ve many more social gifting solutions coming all with the intent of making gift giving and receiving even easier for our customers. The trends I’ve been talking about here today are not just U.S.-centric. We’re driving towards these types of solutions all around the world.	I’d now like to introduce Molly Liu, VP of Digital Ventures China, who will share with us technology innovation in that region. Thank you very much.	Molly Liu	Thanks Jerry [ph]. Good morning, my name Molly Liu. I’m a five-year partner. I think I have the best job in the Company. I lead the Digital Ventures team for Starbucks China. Very excited today to share with you a recent social phenomenon we created across our second home market. It was a mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit that brought me to Starbucks five years ago. We have been thrilled to this mission. Our 2,600 stores across Midland China serve as an attractive surplus destination that brings people together over a cup of coffee.	As we expand the experience to the digital platforms, we saw a unique opportunity for Starbucks to create deeper social connection digitally. To encourage and cultivate a behavior of everyday kindness and appreciation among family and friends, a behavior truly needed in today’s fast developing China. This was a purpose behind creating a breakthrough social gifting feature. We wanted to partner with the strongest social engine hence the strategic partnership with Tencent WeChat was formed last December.	With over 889 million active users of which many of them logging everyday and about half of them spent at least a 90 minute on the app. Tencent WeChat is one of the most and powerful social media in the world. Starbucks and WeChat co-created a social gifting experience and it’s actually named a set with Starbucks [Foreign Language], which had a similar pronunciation as [Foreign Language] meaning, Say It With Your Heart. We aspire to people the shared moments of connection by allowing our customers to speak from their hearts together with a gift of Starbucks coffee or digital store value cards.	I want to share with you, how in a very short time, Say it with Starbucks has made a difference in my own life. My first gift was sent to my best friend from collage [Asim]. We no longer leave in a same city and haven’t met for a long time. My biggest regret was not being able to be there for her when she most needed my support. When I browse through the social gifting offerings, the thinking of you card caught to my attention and I immediately picked on for [Asim], paid with retail pay and easily select [Asim] from my recent contact list. This new feature also allows me to edit to attach text, photo or video in my gradients.	I wrote a personal note to encourage my friend, find more time to relax in a Starbucks store. And the coffee is on me for sure. She received the gift instantly and replied with a big smile. If you think about it, 25 seconds were all that it took for me to make up for this long overdue reconnection. And her big smiley face reply really made my day. Well, sending a gift is a convenient and rewarding experience. Receiving one could create a memorable moment of surprise and delight in anyone’s life. I just received such a surprise gift from my little boy Harry this morning. He knows that I need coffee to overcome jet lag flying from China. So, he sent me a latte together with the heart melting video.	[Audio/Video Presentation]	I miss you too. Miss you too. Miss you to want to hug you, right now baby. My stories are only two out of the over 1 million stories of love, friendship, connection and appreciation that has happened in a past six weeks since we launched sage with Starbucks. Our customers are falling in love with this innovative feature for the seamless experience, emotional attachment and personal touch. Many customers purchased more than one gift and keep coming back. When it takes to receivers start to purchase a gift and pass them love to other people as well which in this a truly viral social phenomenon.	You can tell that I am extremely proud of the Starbucks and we have honored who works tirelessly to bring innovation to life. I’m also humbled when our customers recognized Starbucks for being, not only a global brand that offers a best-in-class service, but also a local brand that created truly relevant experience for the Chinese people. Despite the early success, this is only the beginning of an exciting Starbucks digital journey in China. The best is yet to come.	Thanks again for the opportunity of sharing with you, what we’re doing in China. Thank you. Now, let’s welcome Kevin.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you, Jerry and Molly. Now, in case you didn’t realize what Molly said there is over 800 million active users of WeChat in China around the world. In the first six weeks of launching this social gifting feature, over 1.2 million gifts have been given and our being redeemed in our stores in China, huge, huge opportunity. Now, what I share with you are just a few of the innovative things coming, but I strongly believe that we have the strongest innovation pipeline in the history of the Company.	But now I want to build on what you saw from Molly and amplify the importance of our work in China. Our Starbucks China team is world class, world class, and I’m proud of the work they’ve done to get us to this point. Perhaps nowhere has the Starbucks experience been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we entered 18 years ago, it is our fastest growing market with 2,600 stores across 127 cities, serving more than 5 million customer visits per week.	Now, we’re committed to double the number of stores in China over the next five years, and today we are opening a new store in China, every 15 hours. So, when I put these three things together, Starbucks is about humanly connection at a time when human connection is in more demand. We have the strongest innovation pipeline in history of the Company and we have this amazing opportunity in China. I add those three things together and I come up with the one conclusion, growth. This is why I’m so optimistic about our future and creating shareholder value.	The fact is that we’ve returned $10 billion of cash to shareholders over the last five years in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This year we’re deploying $1.6 billion of capital much of it to build and renovate the most profitable stores in our history and create more shareholder value. And we are investing for our future. We’re investing for the long-term by investing in our partners, investing in digital to position us to capture this opportunity. And you put this altogether and you should all have great confidence in the future of Starbucks, but there is one more reason. Why I believe in Starbucks? And it is the power of our partners.	Starbucks is really gift in my life, and I’ve learned so much by traveling the world and listening to partners share their life story. Share what Starbucks means to them. My partners have taught me three things; first, the power of one, one store, one partner, one customer connection at a time. My partners have taught me the power of family. When I do roundtables in our stores, I have heard hundreds of times partners tell me Kevin, these partners are my Starbucks family and I love them and the power of purpose.	You’ve taught me there are reason for being human connection and doing good in the world, has purpose that can change people’s live, it’s about being part of something that is bigger than anyone of us, it’s a mission I chose to pursue. So, I want to take this opportunity for all of us to recognize and thank to the more than 330,000 and partners who proudly were the green apron and the partners who serve them day-in and day out. This is recognition for the Starbucks partners globally.	I’m proud to be a partner and I want you to know that I’m here to serve you. To our shareholders, I feel a great sense of responsibility to you as well. I know I have vent issues to fill, that’s not last on me, but I will be authentic and committed to stay true to the Starbucks mission, values and guiding principles while working tirelessly to create shareholder value for you. And I want every Starbucks customer and community we serve to know that together we are committed to do good in this world.	My life’s journey has led me here for a reason to serve all of you as we continue on our journey, and I can’t think of the better group of people or a better mission to serve at this moment in my life. Thank you.	[Audio/Video Presentation]	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you very much. Let me try and explain what you just saw and how it relates to the last 30 plus years of the Starbucks experience. First off, that is what we call a open forum at Starbucks and to the past 30 plus years in order to really elevate the internal conversation within our company on a quarterly basis domestically and around the world, our leaders have in our province a open forum or a town hall. We learned over the years that most people that come to work for a company had a previous Starbucks experience. And that job experience more often than not disappointed them, for whatever reason.	And so we have said early on that the currency to the culture, the values and guiding principles of Starbucks, has to be trust and the question is how do you build trust, and so after 30 plus years of having these clients of meeting, we have created environment where people feel very safe, very vulnerable, and if they have a complaints or a concerned, they know there is no retribution and this is really created domestically and around the world, the opportunity for us to really understand with great sensibility, how our people are feeling about the Company each other, what we are trying to do and most important how can we get better and how can we serve them even more.	The San Antonio Open Forum was very unique. We had a market visit in Texas two weeks ago, we visit markets all the time, but why we were there, we decided to go down to McAllen in Texas. For those of you that don’t know what, where or what McAllen is, it is the Rio Grande Valley and it is the border of the U.S. Mexican border. And we wanted to see firsthand, the issues, the complexity not to politicize but really to just on the ground levels see what people are experiencing. And without going into detail, it was a part heart-wrenching day for many of us who heard very, very tough stories.	Now, we recognize this is a problem of great complexity that’s mean there has been try to solve for many years now, but there is no doubt that there has been a significant cause and effect on lots of people and Starbucks partners. And so the open forum was filled with tremendous emotion and what you just saw was a sniff it of what people have to say and how they are feeling who are living and working there. So, we tried to thinking about what should we do today that would really with great transparency demonstrate who we are. So, we are going to take a great risk unscripted and for the next 20, 30 minutes, we are going to have an open forum that Kevin and I are going to host.	Kevin Johnson	Okay. Welcome partners. First time we’ve ever done one of these. I know the first question is the, the first person to share asked the question as always difficult one, so maybe I’ll call on Jenny [ph]. Do you want to go on first? Microphone, over here. Thank you.	Unidentified Company Representative	Gosh, there’s a lot of people out there. Morning everybody, my name is Jenny Robert. I work in the sourcing department and I’ve been a partner for two years. And I’ve always said if I ever got the chance to get in front of our leadership, I would thank them for updating recently a paternal leave policy -- parental leave policy. It’s something that I thought about a lot of really important to me my daughter just turned one year old last week.	She was born last year eight weeks premature and I was in the hospital for a week. She was in the hospital for four weeks and at the time, I was the single income earner for my family and it was, as you can imagine nearly difficult time for us. And so when the partner resources team opened up for us to have a forum to discuss, where we were last fall with parental leave policy, I attended because I really felt strongly about sharing my feelings and my families experiences and at the time what I said was, I think that I really believe in this company’s mission and vision and values and our ability to choose and do the right thing. And low in the hole a couple of months of ago, it was announced that the parental leave policy was updated and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, it’s so important to us parents and people growing families and I can’t say thank you enough, I really appreciate that.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you, Jenny. Jenny what’s your daughter name?	Unidentified Company Representative	Hi, Howard and Kevin, Melissa Nussbaum [ph], I’m a 10-year partner and I’m proud to be a benefits specialist from SCAP team here in Seattle. And over the past ten years of working for Starbucks, much like many 10 year partners, I’ve been able to grow and be in an inclusive environment. So, I kind make the jokes that have come out few times in my life, the first time was nine years ago. I’m originally from tiny town called Raymond Washington, a home of 2,000 people and it was really hard for me to come out as a lesbian.	But thankfully to my Starbucks family because we have such an inclusive environment for member of the LGBTQ community, it was like a non-issue at Starbucks. And so my Starbucks family really gave me the courage to be my authentic self at work, do my best work, because I could be myself. And in addition, it gave me the courage to be myself with my family. So, now my family actually loves my wife, pretty more than me, so they are all dead. But it took a while, so thanks to Starbucks.	And the second time was a couple of years ago, the Starbucks call it achievement plan program was announced and until then I felt like I was in the closet per se and I’ve finished my college degree. I start out with WSU, while it’s happened and I was the first person of my family to go to college. My mom didn’t earn up high school diploma. So, I took a lot of pride in that and when I didn’t finish it, it was a big chip on my shoulder. So, I proudly stand up here and say that along with myself, my wife will be graduating from the SCAP program, spring 2018, and I will be the first person of my family with a college degree in spring 2018. And you’re both invited to my graduation.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you. Melissa.	Unidentified Company Representative	Oh, you all saw me in the video earlier. My name is Tony Ambriz [ph]. I’m from the US-Mexico Border down in Texas. So, it is my privilege to be flown and to know you all, get to know everybody here. Seattle is a wonderful place. So, I am going to share my story with even more people, ten times the amount of people. So, as Howard mentioned earlier, he was in South Texas, McAllen in US-Mexico Border, as you all know immigration is a very, very touchy subject right now with the border wall and all this, negative segment of that, illegal immigrants carry. I was one of those illegal immigrants grown up. I was brought here at the age of four with my parents wanting to bring me for a better life.	The challenges that I faced growing up were very difficult and I was in the deepest of position. So, in 2008-2007 around that time, I was able to finally after so many long hurdles become legal resident, and in 2013, I became a U.S. citizen. After becoming the U.S. citizen, I got my college degree and everything, but I still couldn’t find a job. So, the first place I went to was Starbucks. So I took a leap of faith and I applied. Two years later, I’m still here and it is now my pleasure to share this because it goes to show that.	Yes, I was in that position, I was the bad person as the President or anybody likes to call it but we’re not all of that people, I am here wearing apron in this case the blank apron serving both sides of the U.S. and Mexico Border and we know being in that area, we divided by a wall still, but we’re still the same community, same culture, same people, two different languages and two different governments. So from me to serve both sides of the border in the City of Brownsville, Texas, it is a huge honor.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you.	Unidentified Company Representative	Hi, Howard and Kevin. I am Lee Fellow [ph]. I’ve been with the Company for 20 years, going on 21. I am and actually part of the Retail Systems team and I am the Chair of the China and Asia-Pacific Partner Networking System. It’s some just a long. So, I really want to share with you that family really is core of my family because of my culture and I am so proud to be a part of the Starbucks family. And I was doing, if we’re going to have a family from here?	Kevin Johnson	Family from here?	Unidentified Company Representative	Yes, in U.S.	Kevin Johnson	We haven’t one here in the United States yet, but maybe it’s time for us to consider doing that.	Unidentified Company Representative	The capital and I will be willing to help.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you.	Howard Schultz	I’m sorry. Welcome to everybody. Go ahead.	Unidentified Company Representative	A great day to you Howard. A great day to you Kevin. Congratulations on this journey to cheer us have barked on. My name is Harry Pearson [ph]. I’m with Military Talent Acquisition. And my question is regard to -- we have been a leader in setting the standards on the hiring of veterans military spouses and service members. As we look forward with our new mission, are there going to be any new plan to help more companies understand the value that this magnificent population talent will bring to the table?	Kevin Johnson	One of the thing that we had enable to do is, because of the success we’ve enjoy with bringing military and into the Company. As we’ve shared that with many, many companies. And we had two very successful meetings for musters, where we brought life might in companies together and organization and I think it’s a great level of interest and understanding about the value of military and spouses coming into this company. So, the answer is, yes, and we are telling the story to lots of people and I think as a result of that other companies are following soon, absolutely.	Unidentified Company Representative	Good morning Howard, good morning Kevin. My name is Tammy Somers [ph]. I’m the partner on the inclusion and diversity team. And next Tuesday, I’ll celebrate my one-year anniversary with Starbucks.	Unidentified Company Representative	Congratulations.	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you. And as I’ve been approaching this milestone, I really spent a lot of time thinking about what is Starbucks mean to me? And well there’s many aspects of this amazing company means to me, two things really stand out.	And the first is, Starbucks is a place where I can be me. Being a women, a women of color and corporate America, it’s not always been an easy experience to come to work and really be your full often itself and I’ve been able to do that at Starbucks each and every day to come to work, to be vulnerable, to remove the mask, to share my story and own it without being judged but to be embraced and to be welcomed. And that feeling has really made a difference to me in my life.	And the second is opportunity, in my role I’ve the good fortune of working with leaders and partners in the field and driving inclusion and diversity, well it had been some success. We’ve an opportunity to do more. And that really excites me, as to the opportunities to dream that and to have impact and thank you both for the experience, I am really grateful for it.	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you for sharing that. We’ll go here.	Unidentified Company Representative	Good morning Howard, good morning Kevin, good morning partners and shareholders. My name is Saunjah Powell-Pointer [ph] and I’ve been a partner for three years. I’ve sourced furniture for our beautiful stores and there’re two defining moments in my career here at Starbucks. One of them was December 10, 2014 when our leaders were brave enough to have an open dialogue on race. It touched me because it was on the backdrop of many unarmed black men being killed and a lot of unrest around that. Because I’ve seven brothers and a host of cousins and I know that, that could have been them. It moved me in a way that will stay with me for a lifetime.	And the second moment was June 19, 2015, and in a very quiet and humane way, our leader Mr. Howard Schultz took time to go to Charleston, South Carolina, after nine people were killed at Mother Emanuel church. You asked me to join you on that trip. I don’t think that would have happened in any other company, but you take time to go make sure that the community feels safe, that the community is taking care of, and to see what we can do to use our skills for good and when we visited that church and then we visited our partners in that store, and we heard about how our partners activated that community.	They created safety, they created normalcy. Just that cup of coffee or their pastry, got them through what could have been a very harrowing experience for a lot of people. There were partners who were not working; do you remember? And they came into work in order to be there for the community and I was left with the vision of the Mother Emanuel Church and chalk on a board behind our bar letting the community to know that we stand by before you and with you. And that’s what I mean to be performance driven through the lens of humanity and I thank you for demonstrating that leadership.	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you.	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you for sharing. My name is Rebecca Badger [ph]. I’m 12 year partner at the SSC and I have a similar story of saying. In 2004 I came to the Company as the young professional who has had all of the time in the world to get a degree and put it aside. And 10 years later, May 2014, I found myself a single moment to solder in one of whom had down syndrome and required additional support and I saw all the time in the world slip away. And then in June of 2014, scholarship, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan was announced and a new hesitation was not an option because I’ve given the opportunity to achieve the dream of a college degree. And I started immediately with one of the first classes and stand here before you to two and half years later and finish my course towards to end of February.	I will look for in May and in this first of my family to finish the college degree. And that when I think about the equity of the Company and what they can get to their partners and the benefit, benefits that I’ve received from you over the last 12 years that’s what I carry with me and that’s a message I want you to shareholders to understand to. Is that value is so much greater than just the few thousand dollars to get me there. But it’s what I talk about and that’s what I move forward to rest of my Starbucks journey.	Howard Schultz	Thank you.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you.	Unidentified Company Representative	Hello, my name is Sean Greenlee. I’m a District Manager. I’ve been with the Company for about three years. And I just want to follow up with what Saunjah was saying and even Rebecca over that. Providing some space, yes, I understand we all know the totality where performance driven company who lead through the lens of humanity. But Starbucks truly provides us that space to do that, as a maybe veteran, socially conscious, biracial partner. I truly feel that the mission and values really aligned with what I personally and professionally stand for.	Recently and when I talk about Starbucks giving us the opportunity to do what’s right, when nobody else is looking, I was sent on a civil rights pilgrimage to represent Starbucks down to the South, and it was amazing transformative experience one in which helps me to better understand the social and racial inequities that are going on out there. And to be able to continue to provide partners those hands on opportunities and implement the social impact initiatives out in the store, so that’s real and it resonates with us. Well, much more effectively couples to be able to translate that in the communities in which we serve. So thank you.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you	Unidentified Company Representative	Hi, I’m Kerry Siraj [ph]. I’m a two-year partner, part of Partner Resources. And I love the thought behind these open forums and the transparency that we get from it. And something that we stay with for hours, but one will rise to the top of that, it was the prompt forum that you hosted Howard immediately after you announced the decision to pass on the ring to Kevin. It was heartfelt, it was moving, but I found myself even only being a two year partner being so overcome with emotion in a roller coaster. I think about why that was and that’s because that have the opportunity to join Starbucks to have this opportunity not only what it means for our company, but what it does for community.	I’ve chose to uproot with the support of my husband and my two little girls. I move from the Midwest here as I jump at the opportunity for role here. So I want to thank you for that. But I do have a question, as I’ve since that time reflected and thought about the range of emotions that the two of you have gone through and coming to this decision in this historic time. That your families have taken on and I’m curious as I work through my range of emotions, I can’t only imagine your range of emotions. Then I’ve a question for you in terms of there are few words of wisdom that you’ve shared Kevin through this journey that you’re comfortable sharing with the few 100,000 of your closest friend.	Howard Schultz	As you can see this is completely unscripted. What Kevin and I have spoke about privately and with the team is pretty simple when you think about try to do the right thing. And I share with Kevin that for many many years with we are in our leadership team meeting and when we’re in the board meeting, I try and metaphorically think about two seats in the room that are empty. One is occupied by partner and one is occupied by a customer. And I try and being mindful of whatever we are discussing and ultimately whatever we are ready to decide is that decision going to make our partners and our customers proud.	And it’s true that principle and purpose that has guided me and I know that has guided Kevin the last few years. And there is no doubt in my mind that we’re not perfect we make some mistakes along the way. But conscious and heartfelt commitments we have is trying to owner our customers and our partner and make them proud the decisions we make. It’s a pretty simple thing, business can be very complicated but when you reduce it down to the lowest common denominator and that is our collective responsibility as managers and leaders is to make our people better and proud and to do the same thing with our customers. That’s all we have to do, the rest is MOP.	Kevin Johnson	You asked a bit about sort of the emotions as you go through and as I shared in the video introduced that was showed today. At this point in my life I only want to spend my time on things that bring me joy with people I love. And so that part of it is pretty simple. The harder part though is the fact that we’ve got an iconic founder who’s created this wonderfully beautiful place called Starbucks. And there is great sense of responsibility that I feel to you to every partner in this company to our shareholders to our customers and the communities we serve. And the times that it can be little inseminated, but what gives me comfort is the mission and values of the guiding principles that got us to this point today are the same ones that will guide us in the future. The commitment of partners all our view that I’ve met around the world in the great confidence that we’re in this together and the fact that we still have Howard sitting in the office next door, that’s kind a comforting too.	Unidentified Company Representative	My name is Debra and I am the Store Manager at in San Antonio, Texas. I’ve been with the Company about five years. My store was the veteran community store, but now it’s a military family store. And last September, I have a brother who is in the air force currently in last September, he suffers from PTSD and he had an attempt of suicide. And as I was -- we were driving to SAMMC, the military hospital down there in San Antonio at Fort Sam.	I remember looking at the building, the surroundings, and I knew as much as I lost control because my brother was in there. I knew I wasn’t alone, but because of the programs that we have, the opportunities, the volunteering that we have within military the U.S. so mission continues. I knew I had a bag of people behind us, me and my family to support us at anytime that we needed them, and I like to tell you thank you, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart for allowing those program to happen here at Starbucks.	Howard Schultz	Thank you so much.	Kevin Johnson	Who are you? You need to tell people where you work?	Unidentified Company Representative	I am Cora Carter [ph]. I am the Store Manager at Pike Place Market [ph]. And mainly I just want to say thank you to Howard as there are so many we could all share about the amazing experiences we all have everyday but I just want to thank Howard for his amazing vision of creating a company where we feel like we belong. I know when I was in high school I always wanted to work for Starbucks and then my parents bought a restaurant and we were into all my dreams temporarily and I moved after high school to Hawaii and didn’t have a lot of my family or a lot of my friends around and I was 1,000s of miles away, and I walked into Starbucks store and applied and instantly felt like, I was close to be there.	I knew I belong, I knew it was going to be my family and now being in Seattle at Pike Place eight years later, with all over year later. I feel like it’s our job as partners, but especially a Pike Place to really see an environment where everybody feels safe, everybody feels welcomed, everybody feels like they belong whether it’s a customer is coming from all over the UK, from all over the Japan, Korea or wherever they are coming from, they are going to feel like their family, and they are going to feel like they belong there and that goes with our partners from all over the world as well.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you. How many partners work in Pike Place?	Unidentified Company Representative	Right now about 45, but sooner that will be somewhere so probably close to 60.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you.	Unidentified Company Representative	Good morning Howard and Kevin. Thanks for hosting this partner forum and congratulations on the birthday of grandson. My name is Lauren Alford [ph]. I work in Risk Management and I’m very appreciative to be one of the first 10,000 veterans hired. Today I’m representing the Access Alliance. The information you showed earlier about the tremendous success of our hiring initiatives is awesome and inspiring. And I’m really, really proud to work for an organization that meets a single aspirational goal and then response by saying that’s not enough and re-doubles their efforts.	Today, I’d like to mention another community of highly talented individuals who are underrepresented in the workforce. There is 57 million Americans with disabilities in our communities today, but sadly only 20% are in the workforce compared to 68% of their nondisabled neighbors. My question for you and of course my further hope, you said Starbucks can use our tremendous forces for good to find way to create perhaps the new initiatives to hire 10,000 Americans with disabilities. Thank you.	Kevin Johnson	Well thanks for sharing your story and certainly we have many opportunities to help so many people in need, clearly this is a community of people that we can probably be more for. I know we’ve done a lot to well come them into our stores and to make at Starbucks experience easier, but perhaps there is much more we can do to bring them here as partners. Thank you.	Howard Schultz	So, I want you to perform a special act right now. Kevin and I’ve had more opportunities to discuss and celebrate the transition, feels like happen at least five months ago. But this really is a special moment and I wanted our partners to see it. So I have had one piece of Starbucks that is been in my pocket for almost 35 years. When I came to work at Starbucks, I work in the Pike Place store and more than any other store in the world we would not have a company without Pike Place that really defines everything we stand for. And what I had in my pocket to the last 30 plus years was the key to the Starbucks store at Pike Place. So, this morning which I do every moment I can to go to Pike Place, but every annual meeting I start up with Pike Place, I asked Kevin to join me there this morning. We did this earlier, but I want to do it in front of all of you, I’m proud to give Kevin the key to the Company and to the Pike Place store.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you. I must say, very humbling experience but it’s quite an honor and it’s also comes with a lot of responsibility and I want all my partners to know, our shareholders to know, our customers the communities we serve and I want Harvard to know. I will not let you down. Thank you.	[Audio/Video Presentation]	Howard Schultz	It’s already been quite meeting, we’re not done yet. As Kevin shared with you earlier when he was in Ferguson, Missouri opening our store there, I at the same time was in South Africa opening our first two stores in Johannesburg. And let me show the photos of the Johannesburg store. You get to a market and get ready to open up stores you really never know what to expect, but this is not normal. This was a two hour wait I was pretty warm and these lines have pretty much continued. It was an incredibly successful opening Johannesburg and now we’re getting ready to open up in Cape Town as well.	But the opening in Johannesburg for me personally and emotionally was much more than a opening of a market. Whenever we open up a market, I try and make myself available to all the new partners who are going to wear the green essence for the first time and since in time with them and really honor them and hear their personal story. What happened in Johannesburg was not the usual experience. I really heard the stories the people living in townships and the poverty and the lack of opportunity and hope of business of so many young people and to my surprise all 50 partners that we hired for the two stores have never had a job before, this was their first job.	You should see the joy on their face and level of self that came with the opportunity to represent Starbucks to their friend, their family and obviously to be in front of a customer. And as I was sitting down with them and hearing the stories I kept hearing in African words that I have never heard before. And it kept coming up time and time again and then finally I just said you guys, you keep using the word I’ve never heard before. What is it? The word is Ubuntu. It’s a word that Nelson Mandela used time and time again and finally I got up here to say what is that mean. And I couldn’t wait to just almost yell it out. Howard, it means I mean because of you. I am because of you.	It is stuck with me for a month, the word and its meaning. The story of Ubuntu coupled with a success that we have enjoyed in South Africa throughout the Middle East, China, Asia Pacific, Mexico and Central America, all of the Europe and the universal acceptance of Starbucks now in 75 countries. And everything you’ve seen today is, why I’m still optimistic about the future of our company. Yet, I realize more than ever before that we do not operate in isolation. We live in a time that feels so fragile and so uncertain. We live in a time of increasing divisiveness and vitriol, a little bit time of rising nationalism and isolation that fixed redirects	Unfortunately, we leave in a time when hate and violence, both at home and abroad threaten our shared values. And I think we all know that none of us are new to this danger. And we want for ways in which we can help our families our communities and yes our country. I think we should be asking ourselves two important questions, what is the core purpose and our reason for being and what will it take to build a great and enduring America? When I look back on the last 25 years, two truths are self evident today as ever before. Starbucks coffee company’s success is rooted in the compassion and the empathy our partners show to one another and to our customers every day and you just saw unscripted.	That humanity and generosity lift all those, and both have contributed to the creation of a company far-far greater than anyone’s expectations, not simply because of the quality of our coffee or the design of our stores, but literally because of the power of the human spirit, and the power of Ubuntu. What we’ve achieved as a company in the past quarter century has not been an accident; we’ve been guided by a set of strong core beliefs, we believe living our values is where it all starts; we believe that access to learning is access to a better life. We believe first jobs are how you opt in to the American dream and the promise of America. We believe hiring veterans bring extraordinary talent into the business. We believe doing good in the community is critical to doing business the right way. We believe in opportunity, innovation and the entrepreneurship [Audio Gap] spirit. But the belief that transcends all is our belief in our shared humanity.	What we’ve learned over these years at Starbucks is that it’s always been about walking in each other’s shoes, demonstrating compassion, empathy [Audio Gap] America because we see it every day in our stores with our partners and with our customers. The student studying to become the first in their family to graduate from college; the entrepreneur writing a business plan inside our stores, the police officer sharing a cup of coffee with community leaders. The volunteers readying in for data service; and people of different faith, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs coming together in a respectful and civil dialogue that’s what makes me so optimistic about the future of Starbucks and more importantly about the country we all love. To our customers and shareholders, I thank you for your trust and support throughout all these years. To the millions of partners who have proudly worn the green apron at Starbucks since 1971. I humbly say thank you.	I am because of you. Thank you. I am because of you. Starbucks is because of you. And we are because of each other. Thank you and god bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. We little, I’m not done yet. We do and traditionally and this year is no different have a very special treat for you. Just a few years ago there where I got to be slow. Just a few years ago, just orders was performing at local open mic sessions mostly in Texas working with well busing tables and really working as a dish washer. And we’ve had a long history of Starbucks with music and every now and being able to identify someone with extraordinary talent and hard and someone who really need and opportunity. And not that this person needed an opportunity but we have built relationship with him and he is on fire, his first album was nominated for Grammy, the powerful video for his song the River earned him another Grammy nomination. His musical career has been about passion and perseverance. His songs are sung and written from the heart and I’m so proud ladies and gentlemen to welcome my friend Leon Bridges.	Leon Bridges	How are you doing?	[Performance]	Unidentified Company Representative	Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Lucy Helm.	Lucy Helm	Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Lucy Helm and I am 17-year partner and proud of that. I am here today for the sixth time in my Starbucks career to present the formal portion of the annual meeting of shareholders. We’ve experienced a lot of great things this morning, a lot of wonderful music and inspiration. But I know, I realize in my heart of hearts that this is a part of the meeting that you value the most, anxiously considering the results of your shareholder vote and proposals and the proxy statement.	And in the past, I tell you, I felt pretty confident in my ability to deliver those results to you clearly and accurately. However, this past year I have to tell you, I admit, I’m a little nervous. The past several years, we’ve all experienced a number of notable snap-oohs in the press about the reading of important results. From Steve Harvey, we have to name of Idina Menzel to Adele Dazeem and Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway most recently mistakenly announcing the year’s Oscar winner a La La Land instead of Moonlight. So, you guys, if I get anything wrong, texting seems to be working, and I think tweeting [ph] is big in the administration right now. So, please let me know.	So, first, before we consider the proposals detailed in the proxy statement, it is my honor and privilege to introduce the 2017 nominees for our Board of Directors. All of the Starbucks Board members and nominees are here today, and I’ll ask them to please stand as I introduce them. Mr. Howard Schultz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Kevin Johnson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Senator William W.

Mr. Wilcox has been appointed the Inspector of Elections to tabulate the votes today. We have received an affidavit signed by Broadridge Financial Solutions that notice of this meeting along with related proxy and annual report materials was mailed or made available on January 27, 2017 to each Starbucks shareholder of record as of the close of business on the record date of January 12, 2017. Based on that affidavit, this meeting is duly called with timely and proper notice. In addition, based on information provided by Mr. Wilcox, a quorum of shareholders is present today to conduct our meeting.	Please note that a list of shareholders as of the record date is available for your inspection by shareholders at the Investor Relations table, which is located in the grand lobby behind this auditorium. The polls for the matters to be voted on today are now open. The polls will close immediately after I present the matters to be voted on at this meeting. If you are a shareholder of record as of January 12, 2017, and you have not previously voted or you wish to change your vote, you should deliver you ballet now to the Investor Relations table on the back of the auditorium.	We will now proceed to the five proposals detailed in the proxy statement of this annual meeting. Because notices were submitted within the advance notice period in our bylaws, no nomination or proposal other than those appearing in the proxy statement will be presented at this meeting. The matters to be considered here are all described in our proxy statement. The first order of business is the election of the director nominees as nominated by the Board who I just introduced to you. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for each of the nominees.	The second item of business is the approval an advisory resolution on executive compensation. The Board of Directors recommends a vote for this proposal. The third item of business is an advisory resolution on the frequency of future advisory votes on execution compensation. The Board of Directors recommends an annual vote regarding this proposal. The fourth item of business is a ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending October 1, 2017. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal. The fifth and final item of business is the shareholder proposal and supporting statement submitted by Mr. James McRitchie regarding an amendment to the Starbucks proxy access bylaw.	I would now like to recognize, Mr. Todd Paglia, [ph] a representative of Mr. McRitchie for a period of three minutes. Mr. Paglia, [ph] would you please come to the microphone?	Unidentified Company Representative	Thank you. I am here to advocate for proposal five, proxy access amendment. This proposal asks the Board to make three amendments to the Company’s proxy access bylaws which allows shareholders owning 3% of shares or 2.4 billion continuously for three years to nominate two directors and place the names on the proxy. First, the proposal asks the shareholders be able to nominate 25% of the Board, instead of 20%. We have seen what kind of numbers are required to make real change happen on Board.	Second, Starbucks bylaws limit the number of shareholders that can form a nominee group to 20; each would have to hold an average of 72 million in stock continuously for over three years and so continuously. As of the end of the last reporting period, there were 73 institutional investors that held at least 120 million of stock but only 53 for three consecutive years. Most of these funds have never filed a proxy proposal or participated in an activist campaign. They’re highly unlikely to ever join a nominating group, regardless of the circumstances. This proposal would allow for any or all of our Company’s more than -- 350 institutional investors that have held their shares for the years to form a nominating group. Third, current bylaws prohibit re-nomination of candidates receiving less than 25% of the votes. There has never been a proxy access candidate at any company. Once that happens, it’ll take shareholders sometime to understand the process and the candidates. It’ll take some time to elect proxy access candidates. This proposal will remove the threshold for re-nomination.	Proxy access at Starbucks today is somewhat illusory. Just as the word natural does not mean organic, proxy access at Starbucks does not mean shareholders can actually nominate even a single director. Real proxy access will drive a competition for ideas and talent among Board candidates and create direct accountability to us, the shareholders, vote in favor of proposal five. And I would also like to bring up an issue that many of us experienced coming into this meeting today, which was somewhat disturbing. This is an incredible Company, a leader in so many different progressive issues and the protestors outside; we’re talking about the Starbucks cup, which is not recyclable still. This is an amazing thing, giving your record of incredible progressive work, Costa announced today the number two coffee chain that they are piloting a recyclable cup, the cup that Starbucks promised to bring into it stores by 2015. So, I’m asking you, given all the amazing things that this Company has done, why is it still dragging speed on living up to the promise of delivering a recyclable cup that doesn’t cost over a 1 million trees per year, where Starbucks goes, the world will follow. Please make your cup recyclable. Thank you.	Lucy Helm	Thank you, Mr. Paglia. [Ph] As to the second question is not related to the proposal, we will take that up in the question-and-answer period after this formal portion of the meeting. Thank you for your input on the resolution number five. Respectfully, the Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the reasons set forward in the Company’s proxy statement.	Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the matters to be voted on as outlined in the notice of annual meeting. Because no other proposals were submitted within the advance notice period and our bylaws, no other business matters are in order.	In accordance with our bylaws and at this time, I hereby declare the polls for voting and our 2017 Annual meeting to be closed.	I have received the preliminary tabulation from Mr. Wilcox. And based upon that tabulation, I can tell you that all the director nominees were elected, each of the management proposals were approved, and the shareholder proposal regarding an amendment to our proxy asset bylaws was not approved. The final results will be reported on a Form 8-K within four business days of the meeting.	That now concludes the formal business and I declare the formal meeting to be adjourned. I now turn the meeting back to Howard, Kevin and our CFO, Scott Maw for the Q&A session. Any shareholders who does not have an opportunity to ask a question during the Q&A may submit their question by going to the investor relations table in the grand lobby and completing their comment card. Thank you.	Question-and-Answer Session	A - Howard Schultz	Perhaps, we will take the cup question that was posed earlier, as the first question, while people come to the microphones. I believe that there is no one doing more than Starbucks to make our cups greener. Since 2006, we introduced more than 10% of the content in cups as post consumer fiber. We championed reusable cups and created incentives for customers to use reusable cups. We’ve reengineered lids and worked with the recycling organizations around the world and into the different markets that we do business in. Does that mean we could do more? Certainly. We’re constantly working and sustainability is a big part of our mission and our agenda. But I think in all due respect to the way the question was framed, we think we have done quite a bit in the industry to make our cups green and we will continue to do more. Thank you.	Unidentified Analyst	Fellow shareholders and members of Board, my name is Bruce Freed, [ph] and I’m here on behalf of Green Century Capital Management, an environmentally responsible mutual fund company. Over the past few months Green Century has worked closely with Starbucks it developed its new antibiotics policy to eliminate the routine use of medically important antibiotics in the poultry supply-chain by 2020. This commitment is significant and valuable to shareholders and customers. Congratulations to Starbucks for taking an important leadership role on this issue. The Company’s commitment comes at a crucial time when antibiotic resistance has been named a global public health threat, expected to kill 10 million people a year by 2050.	Starbucks’ commitment offers material value to the Company and it shareholders through mitigation of reputational and regulatory risk, innovation and adaptation to changing consumer preferences and then upholding company values. With this commitment, Starbucks has joined a growing group of companies that has moved to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat supply chain such as Panera, Chipotle, McDonald’s, Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods. By acting now, we believe that instead of lagging behind the industry and risking competitive disadvantages and reputational damage, Starbucks is instead fortifying its brand value and market share.	Starbucks’ new commitment is also forward thinking. Consumer preferences are rapidly changing to favor sustainable and safe foods. From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic-free meat sales grew over 28%, while conventional meat sales grew less than 5%. Starbucks’ commitment demonstrates the Company’s ability to innovate in response to shifting market conditions, differentiating itself in an otherwise highly competitive market. And finally, Starbucks’ antibiotic policy demonstrates a commitment to the Company’s core values of offering responsibly produced high-quality and sustainable products, upholding existing consumer trust and brand respect.	To summarize, antibiotic misuse in agriculture is a major contributor to one of the most pressing public health crises of our time. As a concerned investor, Green Century thanks Starbucks for its leadership, foresight and commitment to creating shareholder value and protecting the health of all consumers. We look forward to continuing to work with Starbucks on this issue. Thank you.	Howard Schultz	Thanks for your comment.	Jan Drago	Hi. My name is Jane Drago, I’m a shareholder but I’m also a Board member of Mary’s Place. I’m here to say thank you. Mary’s Place is a non-profit that provides shelter and services to children and their families. And this December, we ran a campaign called no child sleeps outside. And I want to say thank you to Starbucks customers in King County, to all the Starbucks partners, to the Starbucks Company, Starbucks Foundation, and Sheri and Howard Schultz foundation to helping us raise $4.5 million in less than 30 days. We’re already putting that money to good use just. Just yesterday, we opened the first shelter and facility outside of Seattle in White Center. And I can promise you that we will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we go forward. Now, I do have a question or a comment. We know that the fastest way to solve the homeless problem is for people to have a home. And the most direct route to having a home is having a job. So, maybe you could consider yet one more initiative to hire 10,000 homeless people. And thank you, Howard and thank you Kevin.	Howard Schultz	Thank you very much.	Kevin Johnson	Thank you.	Justin Danhof	Hi. Good morning. I’m Justin Danhof from the National Center for Public Policy Research. In response to President Trump’s first executive order on immigration, Mr. Schultz, you wrote very publicly, “with a very heart, we are witnessed to the conscience of our country and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question.” And that’s of course when you announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. However, according to Business Insider, since that announcement “Starbucks brand has taken a beating.” Starbucks said it would focus on hiring refugees who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel. While that sounds noble, it’s also interesting, because ABC News reported that in 2011, after discovering two Al-Qaeda members with links to Iraq operating in Kentucky, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months, even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi refugee who had aided U.S. troops was assassinated during this President, Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton travel ban. Where was your heavy heart then?	The media didn’t even report on the Obama and Clinton travel ban until 2013, two years later. Starbucks didn’t seem to have anything to say about it then either. I have two quick questions. I understand that as you said, not every decision is based on economics but economics are a hard reality. So, the first question is how much will Starbucks investors have to spend so that the company can properly vet refugees that federal government admits it can’t always afford to vet. And why were you willing to have Starbucks’ reputation take a beating by attacking President Trump’s executive order when you lack the courage to speak out against the Obama, Clinton travel ban?	Howard Schultz	Let me try and answer the two questions and remove the rhetoric from questions. If there is one message that I think I hope you came away with today is that none of the things that we have tried to do as a company which is based on humanity and compassion is based on politics but it’s based on principle and our core beliefs, which I try to really outline very specifically.	First off, on the issue of brand dilution or anything happening as a result of our business with regard to the 10,000 hiring of refugees globally, I can unequivocally tell you and we all know this from the research we’ve done that there is zero, absolutely no evidence whatsoever that there is any dilution in the integrity of the Starbucks’ brand reputation or our core business, as a result of being compassionate.	You keep referencing President Obama versus President Trump, this is not about politics, and there is no additional cost of Starbucks as a result of vetting. But, when you do have people who have defended the nation and saved lives in very, very unsafe areas as interpreters, helping American soldiers, we strongly believe that we have a moral obligation to help them transition back into United States. Thank you very much.	Next question?	Unidentified Analyst	Thanks, Howard. Congratulations on the birth of your grandson and on the new challenges that I am sure will keep making Starbucks even greater company. Congratulations, Kevin on the issues fulfilled. But from everything we’ve heard today, I am very sure that you are going to carry the torch and pick up the mantle on that wonderful corporate culture that Starbucks enjoys. My name is Claudio Vercado, I am a global stock portfolio manager who used to manage fund for Fidelity and other global organizations. Over my long carrier, I invested in hundreds of companies, Starbucks, I’ve been fortunate to be an early shareholder of Starbucks and never sold my shares, and that allowed me to retire early. Thanks, again.	In your book, [ph] Howard, one of the things that really inspired me is that you really have walked the walk, and you really have led by example, and being true to the Company’s values. And I agree with you that Wall Street needs to put more value on values. So, in the long run, there is some debate as to whether Company should be for shareholder interest, I think you are living proof that in the long run which is what really matters, the interest of all stakeholders converge, the way you treat partners and reflects how they treated customers which generates a lot of business and the growth that we have been experiencing as shareholders. So, all of our stakeholder interest will be converged. So, I applaud the fact that all Starbucks employees get stuck.	Also, the success of the rewards program shows that rewards members, as you’ve showed us, increase the value of the business for Starbucks. So my question is and my suggestion is why not make more consumers shareholders of Starbucks? I know that headache there would be managing such a program, would be very big. But there is this new company called Stockpile that allows us even fractional ownership of stock. So, you could give rewards members a…	Howard Schultz	I think we got it. Kevin?	Kevin Johnson	Yes. I’ll just comment, I am aware of some of the new models for micro funding of equities and stocks and it’s something we have looked at it. It’s not something that is currently on our roadmap for features, but it’s something we will continue to evaluate along with many other great ideas. So, thank you very much.	Howard Schultz	Thank you for your support, sir. Because there is a number of people, let’s try and limit question to just a few minutes. Thank you so much.	Unidentified Analyst	Kevin, my name Howard Katz [ph] and I want to thank you for rest...	Howard Schultz	Mr. Katz. [Ph] It’s good to see you, sir. Mr. Katz, this would not be a meeting without you.	Unidentified Analyst	I wanted to say I would loan you my name, Howard, but Howard Johnson would never work.	Howard Schultz	Okay. Your question, sir?	Unidentified Analyst	I was honored to go to Washington DC as a veteran, as a prudent veteran as the World War II veterans are now being flown to Washington DC. And you have to have a guardian. And because Starbucks is all over the United States, we could have our new veterans be guardians. You got to have a guardian to go to Washington DC. I went at Gold Coast, [ph] I wanted to suggest that we have our newer veterans take the veterans that need guardians to Washington DC when they start to get again spring. [Ph]	Kevin Johnson	Wonderful idea.	Howard Schultz	Great idea. Thank you.	Unidentified Analyst	Hi.

There will be a presentation followed by question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today.	I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Ms. Catherine Chan from Tencent. Please go ahead, Ms. Chan.	Catherine Chan	Thank you, Operator. Good evening. Welcome to our annual results conference call for the year of 2016. I am Catherine Chan from the IR team of Tencent. Before we start the presentation, we would like to remind you that it includes forward-looking statements which are underlined by a number of risks and uncertainties and may not be realized in future for various reasons. Information about general market condition is coming from a variety of sources outside of Tencent. This presentation also contains some unaudited non-GAAP financial measures that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for measures of the Company’s financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a detailed discussion of the risk factors and non-GAAP measures, please refer to our disclosure documents on www.tencent.com/ir.	Let me introduce the management team on the call tonight. We have our Chairman and CEO, Pony Ma; President, Martin Lau; Chief Strategy Officer, James Mitchell; and Chief Financial Officer, John Lo. Pony will kick off with a short overview. Martin will discuss strategic highlights. James will speak to business review. And John will go through the financials before we open the floor for questions.	I will now turn the call over to Pony, please.	Pony Ma	Thank you, Catherine, and good evening. Thank you for joining us.	In 2016, we delivered another set of solid financial results while continuing to invest in our social platforms, digital content and ecosystem and new technologies which will increase our long-term competitiveness and drive future operational success. Let me update you on our key achievements in four strategic areas.	In social, we deepened user engagement on our social platforms, Weixin and QQ. We recently launched Weixin Mini Program which facilitates convenient service delivery for our users. For QQ, we introduced live broadcast to enhance social experience and integrate AR technology to our popular red envelope campaign. In games, our smartphone games further expanded product profile and achieved strong revenue growth. During the year, we launched many successful titles, in particular our in-house title, Honour of Kings is the most popular mobile game in China with DAU exceeding 50 million. We expanded our global footprint via strategic partnerships and investments. In PC games, we increased our market share by focusing on serving core games and expanding life cycles of our blockbusters.	In media and content, our news, video and sports platforms generated significant user growth. Our digital content monthly subscriptions more than doubled year-on-year. In music, we solidified China’s online news streaming market this year. And our new WeSing app is now by far the highest DAU karaoke app in China. In our ecosystem, we’re strengthening our supporting partners by ramping up our infrastructure services. Our mobile payment increased market share and daily transactions. YingYongBao and Mobile QQ plus widened their lead against peers and doubled their revenues year-on-year. And our cloud services expanded its capabilities and customer base and tripled revenue year-on-year.	Operationally, we maintained clear leadership in core operating platforms, Weixin and WeChat combined MAU exceeded 889 million, up 28% year-on-year. Total MAU for QQ year-on-year to 868 million, within which smart devices MAU was 652 million, up 2% year-on-year. For Qzone smart devices, MAU grew 4% year-over-year to 595 million. For Smartphone games, we solidified our lead in several key genres, especially in PvP games and deepened our penetration in RPG genre. For PC client games, we remain the industry leader by revenues and user cases.	For our media business, we saw rapid growth in users for activities such as sport and music. In mobile utilities, we continued to lead by monthly active users for mobile security, mobile browser and android app store in China.	Financially, we delivered a strong set of results. For the fourth quarter of 2016, total revenue was RMB43.9 billion, up 44% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB14.9 billion, up 30% year-on-year or down 1% quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB12.3 billion, up 38% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. For the full year of 2016, total revenue was RMB152 billion, up 48% year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB58 billion up 39% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB45 billion, up 40% year-on-year.	I now invite Martin to discuss strategic highlights.	Martin Lau	Thank you, Pony. And good evening and good morning to everybody. I am going to update you on four areas which we have achieved new developments in 2016 and early 2017 fortifying our ecosystem and benefitting our users and partners.	Starting with mobile payment, we achieved over 600 million monthly active users as at the end of 2016 and our daily payment volume nearly doubled year-on-year to over 600 million transactions a day. For social payments during the 2017 Chinese New Year Period, our usages exchanged over 46 billion Weixin red envelopes, up over 40% year-on-year.	For commercial payment, we’re driving user penetration by creating more online and offline use cases, in particular, high-frequency transaction activities. And we’re driving merchant penetration by signing up flagship partners in key verticals such as retail, restaurants; and we’ve also proliferated our coverage of long-term merchants through channel partners. For example, Starbucks recently enabled Weixin Pay in their 2,600 stores in China. As a result of all these efforts, our commercial payment volume tripled year-on-year.	Our mobile payment platform also served as an important channel for our wealth management platform, Licaitong and our banking affiliate WeBank to distribute the internet finance products. We believe our users benefit from greater availability of such products and our partners benefit from targeted access to our user base through our payment platform.	Moving on to news and content services. We are China’s market-leader on mobile and PC news service, ranked by the daily active users. And we’ve also grown our user engagement and revenue significantly during the year. We provide news content to users through a number of different apps and online channels. In the app front, Tencent News and Kuaibao are two standalone apps with complementary use cases. Tencent News provides series and deep news content based on the combination editorial and machine recommendations. Kuaibao delivers personalized reading content to users based on deep learning of each individual’s interest graph. To enrich the diversity of our content library, we launched an open platform in early 2016 to facilitate content creators publishing articles. This has benefitted Kuaibao in particular, which DAU has grown to over 20 million, multiple times of the beginning of the year in 12 months time.	In addition to our news apps, we operate news channels which reach a broader user base. These include Weixin and Mobile QQ plug-in, Official Accounts, Mobile QQ browser newsfeeds and also our QQ Kandian. These channels deliver revenues of broader content in a customized way to our users who can then share with their social graph through chat Moments.	Our news and content traffic increased significantly during 2016. This substantial user traffic and the ability to target users are highly appealing to advertisers, which allowed us to increase the monetization of our new services through a combination of brand and performance advertising. In 2016, our mobile news advertising revenue grew more than a 100% year-on-year.	Moving onto cloud services, we see substantial market opportunities accompanying our connection strategy. Starting from primarily serving game developers, Tencent now is a clear leader in the online game space and live video broadcasting space and is increasingly penetrating verticals including O2O, internet finance, municipal service as well as enterprise.	A unique advantage we have is that Tencent has a solid foundation of technologies in areas such as security, payment, big data analytics, photo processing mini programs and artificial intelligence. Utilizing these technologies, Tencent cloud provides tailored solutions for various customers and industries.	For example, the customized solutions with specialized data centers to satisfy internet finance customers needs to comply with regulations and with additional security. In addition, we expanded our cloud service sales force significantly in the year of 2016 and divided it by industry and geographic focus to better serve our customers. We also quadrupled our range of channel partners, which helped us to acquire more customers. As a result, in the year of 2016, our cloud service customer base and revenue more than tripled year-on-year. Looking ahead, we’ll further expand our overseas infrastructure and continue to invest heavily in cloud services in terms of challenge, technologies, infrastructure and products.	Finally, I would like to share our thoughts about Mini Program, which has attracted quite a bit of attention when it was first launched in the beginning of the year. We view Mini Programs as an enhancement of our official account system designed connect offline service providers with users online. For service providers, Mini Programs allow them to present QR codes at their offline channels, which convert into an online interaction when users scan the QR codes. For users, Mini Programs enhance convenient and fast sampling of interactive experiences such as O2O services. Users who discover a service via Mini Programs may choose to go further and experience other functions in which case they would then download the service provider’s native application. As Mini Program is complementary to both Official Accounts and existing app ecosystem acting as an intermediary serving the process of user acquisition for app downloads.	One very good example of the usage of the Mini Program is with Mobike, which is a bike sharing in China. Mobike users can access its Mini Program when they scan QR codes that fit on their bikes. Once users initiate the Mini Program, they can use basic features such as registration, deposit paying and renting bikes. For those who want to have more comprehensive services, they can download the app and experience the full suite of mobile application capabilities. As a result, after Mobike launched its mini program, its saw a sharp increase in users for both its Mini Program and its native app.	We are excited about the user experience that can be created with mini programs and the benefits it brings to service providers and users. In line with Tencent’s philosophy, we will build our Mini Programs ecosystem at measured space to ensure the quality and variety of service offerings that will match our standards.	Now I will turn to James to talk about business review.	James Mitchell	Thank you, Martin. And good morning, good afternoon, and good evening as the case may be.	In the fourth quarter of 2016, our revenue grew 44% year-on-year. Value-added services represented 66% of our revenue, within which online games contributed 42% and social networks 24%; online advertising was 19% of our total revenue and the other segment accounted 15% of total revenue, up from 5% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, revenue grew 48%.	Looking into value-added services, revenue in the fourth quarter was RMB29.2 billion, up 27% year-on-year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Social network revenue was RMB10.7 billion, up 51% year-on-year and up 9% quarter-on-quarter. Sales of digital content and game-related items were the main drivers of the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter revenue growth; in particular, digital content revenues more than tripled, year-on-year. Online games revenue was RMB18.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter. The increase was mainly driven by player-versus-player and role playing smartphone games. For the full year, our VAS revenue was up 34%, our social networks revenue up 54% and our online games revenue up 25%.	Turning to social networks. The QQ released location-based technology to help Now users discover interesting content broadcasted by people in their neighborhoods, contributing to increased DAUs for Now. During the Chinese New Year, our QQ red envelope campaign also used location technology to guide users to pick up augmented reality red envelopes distributed by participating merchants. Over 250 million QQ users joined the five-day event opening over 2 billion red envelopes.	For Weixin, we introduced Mini Programs, which Martin has already discussed and we integrated our enterprise accounts into our enterprise Weixin app with the unified set of management tools that facilitate synchronization. This unification allows enterprises to manage their internal communication and administration matters with greater efficiency.	Moving to PC client games. For the full year 2016, our PC client game revenue increased 9%. But just looking at the fourth quarter, historically in years such as 2013 and 2014, our PC game revenue typically declines quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter due to fewer student vacation days and fewer special events versus the third quarter. In 2015, our PC game revenue was unseasonably strong in the fourth quarter due to new item types in one of our biggest games. But in 2016, the usual negative seasonality from 3Q to 4Q we reasserted itself which resulted in a 2% quarter-on-quarter revenue decline and a rather modest 4% year-on-year revenue growth rate.	PC game average daily active users decreased 13% year-on-year, reflecting, first, users continuing to shift a portion of their gaming times from actual game played to engagement with game content and other mechanisms such as forums, videos and e-sports events; and secondly, users for some titles moving part of their playing time from the PC edition to a mobile edition at the same IP. Taking CrossFire as an example, since we introduced the mobile version of CrossFire in late 2015, we have seen some impact on our PC version DAUs but the total unique CrossFire DAUs combined PC and mobile is substantially higher than what we had for PC alone.	Looking at the global games market, the PC is still a vibrant platform, especially for hardcore gamers, and we believe that should remain the case in China too. We continue to operate some of the most popular games in the China market while seeking to nurture niche genres such as battle combat and sports as well s developing an e-sports ecosystem.	For smartphone games, revenue in the fourth quarter was RMB10.7 billion, up 51% year-on-year and up 8% quarter-on-quarter; and revenue for the full year was RMB38.4 billion, up 80% year-on-year. According to AppAnnie, we became the top publisher globally in iOS. And we believe that our Android app’s presence is generally stronger than our iOS app’s presence.	Strategically, we made progress along several dimensions within smartphone games. First, we maintained our leadership in casual games and introduced new casual genres such as a fishing game and a chess game. Second, we’ve been developing big DAU audiences for biggest player-versus-player games. Honour of Kings surpassed 50 million daily active users, and we launched freestyle basketball, which has become among the top three mobile sports games in China.	Third, we deepened our penetration in the important role playing game category via titles such as JX Mobile, Fantasy Zhu Xian Mobile and Dragon Nest all consistently ranked in China’s top 10 iOS grossing chart since their launches. Looking forward, we believe represent the rich pipeline including both well-known IPs such as NBA, Contra and TLBB, as well as a range of new IPs.	Moving onto online advertising. Segment revenues for fourth quarter was RMB8.3 billion, up 45% year-on-year and up 11% quarter-on-quarter. Brand advertising revenue was RMB3.1 billion, flat quarter-on-quarter and up 11% year-on-year. User traffic created more inventories on mobile newsfeeds and video, but our brand advertising revenues being impacted by two negative factors. First, many traditionally brand oriented advertisers are increasingly purchasing performance apps, which ships revenue from our brand to our performance category; and second, as our video subscriber base grows, we have less opportunity to have pre-role and mid-role apps before and during our content, shifting revenue from our brand ad to our social networks category.	Our top five brand advertiser categories, online services, in particular ecommerce, automobile, food and beverage, personal care and consumer electronics. Our performance advertising revenue is RMB5.2 billion, up 77% year-on-year and up 18% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from positive seasonality for ecommerce in the fourth quarter. More advertisers joined self-service ad platform especially our pre-launched neighborhood apps in September. The total number of Moments advertisers more than doubled in the past four months. Weixin Moments and Official Account ads were the biggest contributors to the sequential and year-on-year growth, and we also added more inventory in our app store Qzone and Mobile QQ Browser products. For the full year, our online advertising was RMB27 billion of revenue, up 54% year-on-year.	Looking more closely at Tencent Video, we continue to invest in premium content which can contribute significantly to user growth and time spent. In addition to high profile licensed premium content, we’re increasing the investment in original premium content, leveraging our ecosystem to access upstream IPs from literature of games, as well as across platform user insights. We can create original content that is unique and exclusive to our platform. While there is a time lag between commissioning and creating and then screening our original content, we did put some of our original content on in late 2016 including two big budget drama serials, a few animated TV shows and several variety [ph] programs.	Original content is proven particularly effective at growing our video subscription base, which increased over 300% year-on-year in the fourth quarter to over 20 million subscriptions. Specifically, iResearch ranked our Gui Chui Deng or Candle in the Tomb TV series, which is based on a number of novels published by online literature business is achieving the highest user coverage of any online only drama serial during the fourth quarter.	With that, I’ll pass on to John to speak to our financials.	John Lo	Thank you, James. Hello, everyone.	For the fourth quarter of 2016, our total revenue was RMB43.9 billion, up 44% year-on-year or 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross profit was RMB23.6 billion, up 33% year-on-year or 8% sequentially. Operating profit was RMB13.9 billion, up 28% year-on-year or down 4% quarter-on-quarter. Share of losses of associates and joint venture RMB522 million in the quarter, down from RMB1.3 billion year-on-year or RMB619 million sequentially while. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated profits of RMB391 million in the quarter comparing to losses of RMB164 million year-on-year or RMB107 million in the third quarter.	Income tax expense was RMB2.4 billion, up 20% year-on-year or down 2% quarter-on-quarter. Effective tax rate was 18.6% for the fourth quarter and 19.7% for the full year. Net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB10.5 billion, up 47% year-on-year or down 1% quarter-on-quarter. For the full year of 2016, total revenue was RMB151.9 billion, up 48% from 2015. Gross profit was RMB84.5 billion, up 38% from 2015.	Operating profit was RMB56.1 billion, up 38% from 2015. Net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB41.1 billion, up 43% year-on-year. For the fourth quarter, on a non-GAAP basis operating profit was RMB14.9 billion, up 30% year-over-year or down 1% quarter-on-quarter. Net profit attributable to shareholders was [RMB4.3] up 38% year-on-year and up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Operating margin was 34%, down 4 percentage points year-on-year or 3 percentage points quarter-on-quarter.	Net margin was 28%, down 1 percentage point year-on-year or 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter as well. For the full year of 2016, on a non-GAAP basis, operating profit was RMB38.2 billion, up 39% from 2015. Operating margin was 38%, down 3 percentage points. Net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB45.4 billion, up 40%. Net margin was 30% down 2 percentage points.	Let’s turn to segment gross margin for the quarter. Gross margin for value-added services was 63% broadly stable year-on-year or down 2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline reflected, mainly revenue mix shift and increase in share based compensation relating to 18th anniversary bonus shares. Gross margin for online advertising was 47%, down 5 percentage points year-on-year and reflecting increased investments in video content. Sequentially, it rose 10 percentage points as a result of event driven content cost in the first quarter, such as Rio Olympics and Voice of China game up [ph] season. For the full year 2016, gross margin for value-added services was quite stable at 65% compared to last year. Gross margin for online advertising decreased 6 percentage points to 43%, mainly due to greater video content investment.	Moving on to operating expenses, selling and marketing expense was RMB4.5 billion, up 48% year-on-year or up 36% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were mainly due to higher marketing and promotion spending for games and Weixin payments businesses. Selling and marketing expenses represented about 10% of quarterly revenue. Included under the G&A research and development expense was RMB3.6 billion, up 45% year-on-year or 14% quarter-on-quarter. Total G&A expense was RMB6.9 billion, up 45% year-on-year or 17% up Q-on-Q. R&D represented about 8% of quarterly revenue and total G&A was 16%. Share-based compensation was 4% of quarterly revenue. In celebration of the Company’s 18th anniversary, we awarded 300 shares to every employee. Just first 100 shares was vested in November of 2016 and the remaining 200 shares in the following two years. In relation to this exercise, we booked stock-based compensation expenses of over RMB500 million in the quarter.	On a full year basis, selling and marketing expense was RMB12.1 million, up 52% from 2015 and represented 8% of revenue. R&D expense was RMB11.9 billion, up 31% from 2015 and represented 8% of revenue. Total G&A expense was RMB22.5 billion, up 33% over 2015 and represented 15% of revenue. As of quarter-end, we had approximately 39,000 employees, up 27% year-on-year or 2% quarter-on-quarter.	Let’s go through margin ratios for the fourth quarter. Gross margin dipped 4.5 percentage points year-on-year to 53.9%, mainly due to increasing contribution from the other segments, which carried lower margin, as well as continue increasing video content costs. Gross margin was stable sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.1%, down 3.8 percentage points year-on-year, reflecting lower gross margin. Sequential decrease of 3.1 percentage points was mainly due to seasonal increase in selling and marketing expenses less dividend received from the investing companies and donation made to Tencent Charity Funds in quarter four.	Non-GAAP net margin was 28.3%, down 1.3 percentage points year-on-year and 1.2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. On a full year basis, gross margin was 55.6%, down 3.9 percentage points. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%, down 2.3 percentage points. Non-GAAP net margin was 30.3%, down 1.6 percentage points.	Turning to earnings per share and proposed dividend for 2016. GAAP basic EPS was RMB4.383 and diluted EPS was RMB4.329. Non-GAAP basic EPS was RMB4.844 and diluted EPS was RMB4.784. Subject to the approval of shareholders at annual general meeting to be held on 17 of May 2017, we are proposing an annual dividend of HKD0.61 per share.	Let me share some key financial metrics for the year before rounding up this presentation. For the fourth quarter, total CapEx was RMB2.8 billion, up 51% year-on-year or down 22% quarter-on-quarter. Operating CapEx was RMB2.1 billion, non-operating CapEx was RMB709 million. For the full year of 2016, total CapEx increased 57% year-on-year to RMB12.1 billion. Free cash flow reached RMB17.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year or 21% quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to increasing operating cash flow from our games business. On a full year basis, free cash flow was RMB55 billion or US$8 billion, up 50% year-on-year. At as at year-end, our net cash position was about $18.1 billion RMB, down 5% year-on-year and up 117% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year decrease was mainly due to payments for M&A, license content and dividend payments, partially offset by free cash flow generated from operations during the year. The substantial increase mainly reflected approximately RMB7.8 billion, recouped from Supercell financing arrangement in the fourth quarter when we compare with quarter three. The fair market value of our listed associates and available for sale financial assets were approximately RMB89 billion.	This concludes our presentation. Thank you.	Catherine Chan	Thank you, John. We shall open the floor for questions now. And before you ask your questions, please tell us your name and also restrict yourself to one question and we’ll start the queue for the second round of questions if we have time. Operator, shall we take the first question, please?	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Wendy Huang from Macquarie. Please go ahead.	Wendy Huang	Thanks, management, and congratulations on the very solid results, especially the progress you made on the payment front. So, with your payment daily transactions now exceeding 600 million, what kind of breakdown are you seeing between the online versus offline? And also, can you provide some color of the transactions breakdown between the virtual items versus [indiscernible]? And also your other strategy which includes payment, achieved gross margin 20%. So, when do you still actually look at the payment to break even or make some breakthrough on the monetization side and what kind of a take rate you are currently charging towards your merchants? And finally, still rate regarding the payment, I think in light of the recent upcoming, online clearing platform implemented by PBOC, how do you see actually this new online clearing platform to actually change Tencent’s payment ecosystem and also market share in the longer term? Thank you.	Martin Lau	Okay. Let me take that question. In terms of payment transactions, we have achieved, as we said, more than 600 million daily transactions. And if we have to rank, the basic ranking is sort of social payment, which include red packets and then online payment and then offline payment. So that’s the sequence. And we felt this is sort of consistent with the way we leveraged to make our payment platform a ubiquitous platform. We actually leveraged the red packets to allow users to have a very unique experience and very high frequency experience. And leveraging that we were able to deliver commercial transactions to online service providers and subsequently sort of in the course of last year and we were able to leverage that to convince a lot of offline merchants to you use our payment solution. And as a result, we proliferated the payment platform on offline basis. So, that’s sort of breakdown as you can see.	In terms of magnitude, as we said, the total number of transactions close to doubled on a year-on-year basis. And on the other hand, the commercial transactions, which include both online and offline commercial transactions actually tripled on a year-on-year basis. So, you can have a sense of the magnitude of the growth among the different segments.	Now, in terms of the monetization of the payment platform. We actually view payment as a infrastructure service for our ecosystem and our intension is actually to leverage, our payment platform to engage our users to sovle the paint points between merchants and users. As a result, we can actually allow our users to conduct more activities on our platform and we can also allow a lot of our partners to get paid from the users. As a result, we actually benefit as the platform. So, our main motivation is not actually to make money. If you remember around this time of last year, we were actually sort of making losses, quite a bit of losses from our payment platform. And then subsequently, we made some adjustments so that we were able to recoup some of the costs associated with bank charges. And now, you can see we do make some gross margin. At the same time, we actually put in a lot of investments at the marketing level, at infrastructure level, at people level. So by and large, we consider payment at this point in time as to infrastructure service rather than a service that generates profit for us. And I think that status will maintain for quite some time.	And finally, you’re right in pointing out that sort of there is going to be a new system put in place by PBOC. And I think there are two things. One is sort of on a technical level, we are actually sort of helping PBOC quite a bit in terms of organizing the new platform and also sort of contributing our own technology to help the PBOC platform to develop. And over time, we expect to some transactions will actually sort of be migrated to the centralized platform. We believe if there is a central clearing platform that sort of is very scalable, it’s actually sort of good for the entire industry. The second one is actually related to part of the float of the users, which need to be deposited with PBOC. And right now sort of roughly 12% of the float is actually required to be deposited with PBOC and which actually sort of we do not receive any interest. We believe over time, this number may increase. But at the same time, I think sort of, the government is also cognizant of the fact that a lot of the payment solution providers are actually sort of rely on some of this interest to actually recoup some of the costs. So that’s why, I think there will be measured schedule in terms of increasing that deposit number.	Catherine Chan	Okay. Thank you, Martin. Operator, shall we take the next question, please?	Operator	Certainly. Next question is from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead.	Alicia Yap	Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. My question is related to advertising. I just wanted to get a sense how much of the decelerations of the brand advertising revenue growth is attributed to the shifting of the ad inventory from the brand to the performance base versus the impact from the soft macro and also the impact from the subscription cannibalization? So, I appreciate if management could share some color, the upcoming trend of the brand growth outlook as well. On the performance base side, can management share some feedback on the recent small scale adoptions for the short form video ad format in Weixin? So, any plans for a broader rollout on the video format in the future and also the ad inventory increase in the coming months? Thank you.	James Mitchell	Okay. In terms of the brand advertising question, the answer differs by the type of inventory you’re thinking about. So, for our online video advertising revenue, the deceleration is likely primarily due to the growing percentage of video MAUs that are also video subscribers, which entitles them to skip most forms of in-feed, pre-feed advertising. On the other hand, if you look at our news advertising revenue, which is actually our biggest brand ad category or if you look at our mobile browser or our mobile app store which are very fast growing categories, then the primary change is the mix shift from inventory being allocated to brand into inventory being allocated to performance. So, for those products, the overall advertising revenue is growing quite quickly but it’s just the brand proportion is declining, the performance proportion ramps up.	In terms of the overall macro, I mean it’s always nice to blame one’s challenges on the macro environment. But, in reality, the Chinese macro economy I think is being fairly healthy the last few months. So, it would be kind of an easy escape for us and not necessarily a correct attribution for us to say that the brand advertising slowdown was due to macro. I mean it’s certainly less due to macro and more due to the substitution effects.	In terms of the second question around advertising on a short form video within Weixin, I mean clearly that’s a global trend toward putting more advertising around short form video, especially on social networks and equally clearly it’s a trend that is being intense and we would follow with high degree of carefulness. So, it’s to not upset our users. And so, it’s to provide a good environment and a high click rate for our advertisers. So, we are seeing very rapid growth in video used within our social networks. But, we recognize that putting in a heavy ad load around those short form videos could both be irritating to users and for those users who are on wireless or on Wi-Fi plans, costly for those users as well. So, we’re moving forward at a measured pace.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Operator, next question please.	Operator	Next question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.	Eddie Leung	Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question more on the potential impact of certain applications on your social apps. So, we have seen more-on-more of your peers are launching short form video content, as far as mobile news feed apps. So, wondering, if you have seen any cannibalization of this type of new applications on your social apps and how you are going to deal with that, any problem? Thank you.	Martin Lau	I think you’re right in pointing out that new short form video and news feeds are becoming very popular product category among a lot of industry players. I think, as a matter of fact, if you look at our -- especially in my prepared remarks, we talk about news on content services. We have also launched a number of these products within our -- both in terms of sort of individual app like Kuaibao as well as in our various different products as product feature. And as a result actually, our overall page views on text, on photos, pictures, as well as on short video has actually increased quite substantially across our platform.	So, I think it’s a phenomenon that clearly the mobile handset is actually bringing to the industry by having a new way for distributing content, not just based on editorial way or social way. If it’s actually based on machine learning, you can actually sort of map the interest graph of users better and as a result you can actually sort of increase the amount user engagement on those contents. And also certainly by having a platform of a more diversified content, there can be sort of a lot of different writers, writing articles and shooting short media of different kinds, and you have a platform to include these contents and sort of it would add also increase the user engagement.	So, I would say, this is an industry phenomena, and we actually have also rolled out products and services to -- as well as overall content platform, to benefit ourselves from this. And as a result, actually our total page views across all these formats have actually increased quite substantially, as well as our revenue has actually increased quite substantially too. So, it’s actually a positive for us.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Operator, next question please.	Operator	Next question is from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.	Alan Hellawell	Thank you very much. Just a question on ads. If we hypothetically toggle together video subscription revenues and ad revenues, do we see any trappings of a potential improvement in that P&L from what has been a chronically negative margin business? And related to that or as part of that though, could you just give us an update on the number of P4P advertisers we have on the platform now and what we can expect throughout 2017? Thank you.	Martin Lau	I think, if you take the video advertising subscription revenue together, they’re growing at a relatively healthy rate, albeit the mix is obviously shifted fairly substantially from advertising being a growth driver to subscriptions being the primary growth driver. We’re not focused on profitability for the business this year. And I think that in the longer term, it is correct to observe that globally video subscription business is a much higher margin than video advertising businesses, ESPN or CNN achieved three to five times higher margin than CBS or ABC. But at this point in time, I think we and our peers in the market are investing to grow the video subscription business, particularly by purchasing original content which we alluded to in the remarks earlier. So, for the foreseeable future, you should expect the video business to remain loss-making, although in the longer run, the subscription aspect should be breakeven sooner and become more profitable within the advertising aspect. In terms of the number of pay for performance advertisers, we don’t necessarily disclose that every quarter, I am afraid.	Catherine Chan	Okay, thank you. Next question, please.	Operator	Next question is from the line of Jun Young [Ph] of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.	Unidentified Analyst	Hi. Good morning or good evening guys. Just a question on your Mini app. I know that Martin gave a little bit of update in the prepared remarks. I just wanted to just ask what metrics should follow in terms of how to gauge the performance of that business going forward. And second of all, a follow-up to that is, can you give us an update in terms of like how many partners you’re working with, why the monetization opportunity is in the near-term and at the same time what verticals are most active in that particular field? Thanks.	Martin Lau	Yes. I think I have to reiterate sort of Mini Program. So, I think sort of the purpose is actually to solve a pain point in the ecosystem in a sense that a lot of offline service providers, when they actually can access users, it’s very difficult for them to provide a sampling of their services online to these users and they sort of get people to sign on to our existing infrastructure, which is an Official Accounts, the Official Accounts can allow the sending of content but certainly not really sort of readily available interactive services. And if the service -- try to want to induce the users to download an app, the barrier of entry is actually quite high. So, by leveraging Mini Programs, service provider can actually sort of help the users sample the online interaction very quickly and as a result provide, value to the users and at the same time users actually like the service; they can actually go ahead and download the maiden app.	So, I think that’s sort of what we’re trying to provide. And as a result, I would say if you look at the type of service providers, it’s essentially sort of mostly offline service providers who can actually provide some kind of interactive services online. And if you look at sort of our purpose of launching this service, this platform is actually sort of solve a pain point, then -- I think it’s not actually for short-term profit. I don’t think Mini Program would actually sort of generate any significant financial return to us, but it would actually help our ecosystem to be more convenient for both uses and service providers. And we believe that from a long-term perspective, we can actually help users and service providers to connect in a more seamless way and benefit as a platform. I think that’s really sort of what our intention is.	So, as you see -- or how do you actually monitor the performance of this platform. I think looking at some of the used cases that’s in the market I think it’s actually a better way to observe it. If you look at Mobike, I think very clearly, they have benefited a lot from this mini program. And we actually hope in the near-term to just work with different service providers to establish some really great pilot projects and then demonstrate the value proposition of mini programs, and as a result help more and more service providers to get on this platform.	Catherine Chan	Yes. Next question, please. Thank you.	Operator	Next question comes from the line of John Choi from Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead.	John Choi	Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the AI, artificial intelligence. Which are the areas that Tencent is considering, when it comes to AI investment? And also, from the management’s perspective, where does Tencent stand in terms of other players within the industry, given that AI is becoming such important part of technology these days? And just quickly on cloud, I remember that on the prepared remarks that, it seems like Tencent is going to invest more. So, could you elaborate which areas management sees in terms of potentials within the cloud opportunities for Tencent in long term? Thank you.	Martin Lau	Yes. In terms of AI, we actually view AI as a core technology across all our different products. So, what we’re trying to do is actually in each one of our businesses, we encourage our team to apply, to build up talent pool as well as to apply the core technologies around AI, machine learning and deep learning. And at the same time, at the corporate level, we also established an AI lab, which is more research based, so that they can actually focus on more basic building blocks around AI. And if you look at sort of the areas of AI that we are investing in, it would include areas such as speech recognition, it would include picture and photo recognition, computer vision, natural language processing and all sorts of deep learning, as well as basic architecture for deep learning platform. And the way, we look at this technology is also that in order to build long-term competitiveness, you don’t only need sort of the people, as well as sort of the mathematical and computational expertise, but at the same time, you also need a lot of data, you also need a lot of usage scenario, so that you can actually apply these AI technologies, and as a result you can actually keep progressing.	So, I think if you look at our actual products, around content recommendation, around our advertising, around our photo processing app, there are actually a lot of existing products which will benefit from AI. We are also sort of investing in more pure research projects. You may notice that our Go chess player, a Fine Art, has recently won the championship in UEC competition. That’s an example of our research project. And at the same time in the future, we believe that AI technology can also allow us to explore new areas such as personal assistance, such as maybe even sort of autonomous driving. So, these are the areas that we will focus on.	Now, in terms of cloud, we believe that at this point in time we have a lot of internally developed technologies which we can actually sort of package into the cloud and share with the broader community and ecosystem. So, if you look at for example, we are the leader now in gaming cloud as well as in video cloud. And the reason we were able to actually come from behind and sort of took the leadership is because of the fact that we have a lot of core technologies in those fields, which we share with our ecosystem. And over time, we’re going to package more and more of our service -- our technologies around big data, around scalable system, around security, and mini programs, payment platform in order to benefit cloud customers. And we are also building up our sales and distribution channel in order to scale up our business.	We believe that at this point in time, we want to sort of keep on investing in infrastructure as well as our sales and distribution channel, so that we can actually sort of build scale of our business. Over time, if we can actually sort of package more and more of our core technology into a PaaS or SaaS solutions for our customers, then that would be another add a layer of opportunity for us to generate more value-added for our customers and also more monetization opportunity for ourselves.	Catherine Chan	Okay. Thank you very much for your question. Operator, next question please.	Operator	Certainly. The next question is from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	Piyush Mubayi	Thank you for taking my questions. May I just ask a question about the gaming revenues, which appear to have slowed down in exit of the year at a slower run rate than we’ve seen for the previous three quarters? Could you give us any sort of indication whether we should expect this to be the run rate into 2017? And also if you could touch, you talked about four new PC games, six new mobile game launches for 2017 and you’ve named them all. Could you give us a sense of how big we could expect these to be, or any other color that would help us gauge the size? And we’re concerned that I think you said in the press call that the restriction on Korean games won’t impact you? Thank you.	James Mitchell	Yes. So, I’m not sure this would be all that helpful for you. But, in terms of the game revenue growth in the fourth quarter 2016, as we mentioned, if look back at prior years, historically Tencent’s PC game revenue is seasonally strong in Q3, when there is summer holidays and events around the summer holidays and seasonally weaker in Q4. 2015 was an exception to that pattern, because of some specific new items within our biggest game. Then in 2016, we reverted to that pattern with PC games descending from Q3 to Q4, which was different from 2015 and makes for a tough year-on-year comp but in line with what’s happened in years prior to 2015. So, I think that’s all we can really say about the fourth quarter PC game revenue growth deceleration.	In terms of how successful the new games prove to be, obviously we hope that they are successful as possible. In terms of the impact of the regulations around Korean games. So, those Korean games that are already operated in China and for those new Korean games, which are not yet operated but already been approved, as best we can tell at this point in time, should be business as usual. Now, there may be other Korean games that we’re hoping to source in the future and if they are delayed, then that would essentially be unhelpful. But against that, A, Korea is just one of many sources for the games along with China itself, the U.S., Europe and so forth for us. And then being our experience, it’s often the case that delaying a game, certainly a few months or quarters tuning it results in a bigger, better game once we do finally publish the product as opposed to rushing to market as soon as possible.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Operator, next question please.	Operator	Certainly. Next question is from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead.	Ming Xu	Thank you, management. I have a question on the margin impact from the video and cloud. So, your competitors, both of the two competitors announced a very aggressive content budget for the online video in 2017 and also we recently read some news about one of the very aggressive bids from you on the government cloud program. So, my question is firstly, can you maybe give us more color on your online video content cost for this year? And secondly, what kind of revenue or market share target for your online video and cloud service business? And thirdly, to achieve those targets, what kind of margin drag or loss can you tolerate?	Martin Lau	Yes. These two businesses are definitely sort of new areas that we invest in. I would say sort of video and loss is actually quite a bit bigger than cloud business loss. But on video, as we have repeated multiple times before, we actually view video as a very important part of our overall customer experience because it actually provides a lot of engagement with our users on a very large scale. So, as a result, we felt this is actually an area that despite the fact that it’s losing us quite a bit of money, we actually feel that it’s important for us to invest in. And as you point out, in order to stay competitive in this market, we actually have to spend quite aggressively on the content. And I think that’s exactly what we have been doing and will continue to do.	On a medium-term basis, we felt the loss would actually increase because the cost of content has actually increased much more than the revenue increased in the market, despite the fact that you can see advertising revenue has been increasing and as subscription revenue has been increasing even more. I think over time, as we continue to do original content, as we continue to increase our monetization around subscription and at the same time, if we can actually participate in the creation of the original content and share some of the upside in terms of content, then the economics may actually sort of move toward the more positive side. But I think that would happen in a few years, not these two years.	In terms of cloud, the point that you mentioned is really sort of more of an isolated case. I think what we do now is actually in some of the smaller orders, we actually allowed our sales people to make on the spot decisions on how to bid for projects. And I think like it or not, our frontline people decide to make that bid. I think it’s much more of an isolated case. And given it’s small order and frankly it has attracted a lot of attention in the industry and it probably pays back from a media value perspective. But I think on a longer term basis, we don’t view undercutting price as the core strategy for us in cloud, of course we will provide a very, very competitive price in the market. But as I said in a cloud service, over time, we believe that it’s actually the value addedness that would actually differentiate the cloud service providers. And we are very confident that with our technology, we can actually do that.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Operator, in the interest of time, we will take the last three questions please.	Operator	The next question is from the line of Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please go ahead.	Thomas Chong	Hi. Thanks, management for taking my questions. I have two quick questions. The first one is about Honour f Kings. Can management give us some color about the performance in the month of January and February? And are we seeing accelerating trends for mobile games in the first quarter? And my second question is more on order basis. Can management give us some color about the ARPU for MMO, advanced casual and smartphone games in the fourth quarter? And my final question is about the operating expenses trend, in particular the sales and marketing trend in 2017?	Martin Lau	Yes. I think on Honour of Kings side, I think if you -- in the market, you can feel that sort of in January and February, it has become more popular among the users. I think that’s the extent we can give you because certainly on a financial basis, we don’t actually provide guidance and will continue with this tradition. Now with the margin question, I’ll pass to John.	John Lo	In relation to the ARPUs for MMOG, the quarterly ARPU is within 310 to RMB450 and for advanced casual game, it was within 100 to 365. Whereas for platform games, we treat it as a one portfolio; it ranges from 145 to RMB155 per quarter. In relation to the selling and marketing expenses, I think at this point in time, it is not really going at a very quick rate, taking into account that year-on-year growth is only increased by about 36%, which we consider not to be very significant, especially when certainly a marketing costs are basically discretionary in nature. And if there are opportunities, we’ll invest heavily on it; whereas under normal circumstances, I think it will grow quite organically.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Next question, please?	Operator	Next question is from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead.	Chi Tsang	Great. Hi, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about WeChat Moments user experience. Can you share with us what sort of metrics you are monitoring to sort of measure user experience; what trends you are seeing and how people are spending time on Moments? And I am wondering if you see if there is a lot more potential, engagement time that people can spend more on WeChat Moments.	Martin Lau	Yes. In terms of WeChat Moments, we obviously do look at the number of users who actually sort of use the feature and how many times they actually open it, as well as, how much time you spend on it. But at the same time, we actually sort of pay a lot of attention to the quality of the content that people are seeing. Because one of the things that we actually do not want is actually sort of people get overloaded with the content which is sort of low quality. So, there is a range of quantitative indicators that we look at, but at the same time we also saw a lot of qualitative indicators to make sure that the quality of engagement is actually high. I think so far, we believe that WeChat Moments is still very vibrant product user experience and the quality is actually quite good.	Catherine Chan	Thank you. Operator, we’ll take the last question, please.	Operator	Certainly. Last question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead.	Natalie Wu	Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is regarding the game business. So, given the fact that Honour of Kings resembles League of Legends in a lot of ways and Honour of Kings is obviously delivering a very impressive performance during the past several months, so just wondering will Honour Kings have some kind of cannibalization effect on League of Legends in terms of active user, engagement in revenue et cetera?	Martin Lau	Yes. I think the two games actually cater to different kind of positioning. If we look at League of Legends, it’s actually sort of catered to core gamers. And if you look at Honour of Kings, it’s is actually experienced that’s catered to more casual players. And so far, what we have found is sort of the growth in Honor of Kings is accompanied of continued growth in League of Legends. So, in some cases, users actually sort of will play Honour of Kings; when they get more and more hardcore, they can actually sort of move over to League of Legends. So, what we have seen is that they’re not really hurting each other.	Catherine Chan	Okay. Thank you very much, operator. We’re closing the call now. If you wish to check our press release and other information, please visit our Company website at www.tencent.com/ir. The replay of this webcast will also be available soon.

So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.	I’ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.	Mark Parker	Thanks, Nitesh and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, delivering revenue growth of 5% for NIKE, Inc. to $8.4 billion. On a currency, neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 7%. Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 44.5%. Earnings per share increased 24% to $0.68, and we delivered ROIC of 33%. Q3 saw NIKE sustain our positive momentum.	Let’s start with highlights from an amazing quarter for our athletes. Serena won her 23rd Grand Slam, Roger took the Australian open against Rafael to extend their great rivalry; and both NIKE and Jordan continued to dominate basketball’s biggest movements. At the NBA, All-Star was 20 of the 25 players on the roster, and in March madness with 12 of the teams advancing to the Sweet 16.	This quarter, we also raised the voice of our athletes with the equality campaign, showing yet again that NIKE stands up for our believes, our message spreads far and can be a catalyst for true positive change. With wide spread energy behind the athletic industry right now, NIKE is aggressively competing in every market, and we are creating our own opportunities using our combined power and scale.	Last quarter, I talked about our relationships with consumers, and how we're getting sharper and moving faster to serve them. That sense of focus has only accelerated over the last 90 days. The consumer has decided digital isn’t a just part of the shopping experience. Digital is the foundation of it. This and other factors have shifted consumer patterns, especially in North America, impacting traffic, the economics of brick-and-mortar retail and is driving a more promotional environment in the near term.	While we are mindful of these near-term dynamics, we remain focused on the long term. The current backdrop represents a tremendous opportunity for NIKE, because the brands that win are going to be the ones that have been out in front with digital and leading with service. While we don’t expect this transition to be simple, we are clear about what it will take to get there.	We're aligning all of our firepower against the consumer experience. To see consumers rising expectations, we're driving fundamental change in three core areas of our business, through the innovation that inspires them, the supply chain that delivers it quickly and in the marketplace, where we connect personally, with consumers. And while we continue to see great success against all three areas, we committed to doubling our impact in each of them. We call it our triple double. So what do I mean by that? In products, we're doubling our cadence and scale of innovation through performance and sports style. Throughout our supply chain, we are doubling our speed, from product insight to delivery to the consumer, and in the marketplace, we're doubling our direct connections with consumers through digital membership and personalization. To win now and create the future, we're obsessing these three areas, 2X innovation, 2X speed and 2X direct. I'll give you some detail on each.	Let's start by going deeper on 2X innovation, where we're shifting to even faster innovation cycle and scaling more effectively. Our consumers will feel the impact of this immediately. For example, in just a few days we're launching our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max Cushioning System ever. We'll continue to push the edges of style with Air Wafer Max and quickly scale it into new models. And to kick off the sub-two-hour marathon break in two project, we've developed a disruptive design with the NIKE Zoom X Midsole. The Zoom X providers' runners with an incredibly comfortable ride and energy return like we've never seen before. With running footwear, we're always looking to improve efficiency. That's why we're so excited about the new NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4%. As a former marathoner, I know that even a 1% gain would be an impressive accomplishment. But over our previous best shoe, this delivers an astronomical 4% gain in efficiency. It's no surprise that feedback from our lead athletes has been off the charts. We can't wait for more runners to give it a try when we release the NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4% in early June.	Later this summer, we'll unveil a third Platform, a next generation cushioning system designed in radical new forms that help runners and baseball runners increase their performance and stay fresher longer. Using a new material, this will be the first widely available NIKE platform that merges our new algorithm based approach to designing with data. Combined, this new system with Vapor Max and Zoom X, and that's three new cushioning platforms coming to market in the months ahead. As our consumers, will soon see, this is truly a cushioning revolution from NIKE.	In apparel, NIKE and the NBA will bring fans closer to court side next fall. We're delivering innovation that extends way beyond the court, covering every stage of the players' journey. That's a huge untapped commercial opportunity, and our strategy will be to blend sport with everyday lifestyles for both the athlete and the fan. All of this innovation, gives NIKE a critical edge in the near term, but we know a loaded innovation pipeline is what ignites our next phase of growth over the long-term and there's plenty ahead.	Looking toward the future, we're in the later stages of evolving and scaling personalized performance beyond the HyperAdapt 1.0, with more comprehensive fit systems, including continued advancements in our FlyEase technology, a new level and look of Flyknit that's so strong it can withstand the forces of the NBA's most powerful players, and merging performance and style in another new cushioning platform that actually conforms and shapes to the foot for ultimate comfort. With all of these products to hit the market over the coming months, it’s clear NIKE is driving a faster innovation cycle and bringing it to more people than ever before.	Our second area of focus is to create a more agile and opportunistic organization or 2X speed inside and out. We continue to stay one step ahead of the consumer. We will cut our average product creation cycle in half. One way we’re doing that now is through our express lane, where our global product teams and our product engines make real time adjustments to DTC and wholesale product lines with local teams in North America, Western Europe and China. We’re moving faster than ever before, getting products to market in weeks not months. Through the express lane, we're fueling consumer demand through new localized styles. We're supercharging our most successful franchisees.	For example, we build more flexibility and speed into the delivery of some of our top sellers like the Air Pegasus, the Air Force ,1 and we’re looking ahead to include the Air VaporMax as examples. Another key to moving our teams closer to market is the work we’re doing within our manufacturing revolution. With partners like Flex, we’re expanding into more styles with advanced automation in the build and adhesion processes, localizing sourcing for quicker material lead time and reducing waste through advanced knitting and higher precision cutting technologies. We’re seeing a positive impact to gross margins in the tens of millions and we expect that to continue to accelerate.	These are not separate initiatives. We're linings up the pipes of our manufacturing revolution, with real time consumer insights, seamless inventory and a hyper local marketplace approach, all of which is connecting the dots in the name of speed for the consumer. To make room for this speed, we’re driving focus through our Edit-to-Amplify approach. This is an area where we have not been as sharp as we need to be. Currently 75% of our styles generate 99% of sales. By editing out 25% and amplifying the productivity of both new innovations and the products consumers already love, we’re driving more growth and choice from fewer styles, and we’re already seeing positive near-term returns from our work here. Edit-to-Amplify is a mindset that reaches well beyond product. It’s about prioritizing every step along the way, from the category to GO's to cities, to accounts, all the way down to the door level.	Our final area of focus is 2X direct. This strategy doubles the business that is in direct service of the consumer, and we do this by leveraging this digital and membership to bring the NIKE brand closer to them, regardless of whether they are in our own DTC or with wholesale partners. We want to extend NIKE’s homeport advantage across all channels. We are seeing the opportunity up close. Take NIKE Soho for example, which some of you have visited. When consumer walks through that door, they get one to one personal shopping service, invitations to our running and training clubs with other members, the opportunity to trial our latest innovations, and seamless access to product to get them what they want quickly. And what we found is that NIKE plus members who use our personnel shopping appointments generate more than three times the average transaction size. We see the consumer shift within digital commerce as well, with a larger share of our growth coming through our apps. Its further confirmation that the consumer responds to a simpler, faster and more personal connection. And right now that level of service, that deeper experience with the NIKE brand is driving growth in our own DTC.	Moving forward, we will expand that opportunity by rolling out these successes with our own wholesale partners around the world. The more directly NIKE engages with the consumer, the greater the return. We've seen it with our strategic partners in key accounts, such as footlocker, Dicks, JD, Intrasports and TMall, where we've grown our businesses together, despite the uneven environment. And for those partners who align with our more direct approach to the consumer, we have an opportunity to leverage the Express Lane even more. And we know there still more work to be done here. More personnel, more mobile, more distinctive, these are the dimensions that will drive growth. And I’m convinced now is the time to rewrite the playbook of retail.	When I look out to the next year, we have a lot be excited about. Now it’s more important than ever for NIKE to say true to our own values and leverage our competitive advantages. There will always be room to improve, but I’m proud of the way we're managing our business today and I’m bullish on our opportunity to extend our leadership position for tomorrow. Our triple double strategy is setting the stage for this next phase of growth at NIKE, to win now, and to create the future.	Thanks, and now here is Trevor.	Trevor Edwards	Thank you, Mark. Hello, everyone. In Q3, the NIKE brand delivered another solid quarter of growth. As always, my remarks are on a constant currency basis. NIKE brand revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and our emerging markets' geographies.	NIKE brand DTC revenue increased 13%, driven by 18% growth in digital commerce, new store expansion and 6% comp store growth. Today NIKE is in a familiar place on the offence. Mark said, we are doubling our direct connections with consumers, an approach that will be seen at retail as we ramp up how we serve our consumers through digital commerce and membership. And as always, we work to create brand energy across performance and lifestyle, connecting consumers to the products they want and love, and we bring it all to life through our geographies, a global portfolio that provides NIKE unrivaled agility and scale.	Now, let’s get into a bit more detail on these three areas. Our deep relationships with consumers drives us. We built the NIKE brand by serving consumers. It is our central promise. And as we grow in scale and reach, we continue to serve our athletes personally. Mark spoke about the power of personalized service and seamless commerce in North America, particularly in our Soho and Miami stores. Let me just add that we’re seeing the same success around the world as well. In January, we opened a NIKE and Jordan store in Beijing, our largest basketball-focused store in China. There, a NIKE+ Basketball Trial experience and t-shirt customization offers seamless links between NIKE’s physical and digital platforms. As we roll out more experiences like these, consumers see that retail is more than a series of transactions. We believe it should be personal and full of energy. For us, personal service is the new premium.	To that point, our NIKE+ and SNKRS apps are successfully serving consumers more individually. Despite still only being offered in North America, they are driving more growth, better consumer engagement and higher conversion rates. With our investments in cloud technology, we are accelerating the global expansion of our apps, to become even faster and more nimble in serving the consumer’s changing needs. All of these experiences offer powerful examples of the services that will enable us to double our direct connection to consumers, both in our owned and partnered retail.	At the same time, we are relentless in our goal to design products that deliver both innovation and style. Running and Basketball, two of our most important categories, sit at this intersection. In Q3, Running saw continued success, especially in our international markets, as the Air Zoom Pegasus showed strong sell-through. Also, as we celebrate the month leading up to Air Max Day, we’ve unveiled several styles that are drawing strong consumer demand, including the first Air Max 90 Flyknit, the Air Max 1 OG in its 30th-year anniversary, and the Air Max Jewell, a sophisticated new silhouette designed for women.	And of course, the launch of the Air VaporMax this weekend will be a significant moment for the NIKE Brand. We debuted a laceless version of this performance shoe in Paris and drove energy throughout the fashion world. After all, the quest for perfect performance influences style, and vice versa. And the shoe, simply constructed of two of our greatest inventions, Air and Flyknit, fulfills our dream of walking on nothing but Air. We will continue to build consumer excitement for the Air VaporMax, by bringing new creative versions and global scale to serve this incredible energy we are seeing. We have high expectations for the Air VaporMax, and I'm very excited about the launch.	In Basketball, we're seeing great energy, from the game, to our athletes, to our products. Let’s start with this: the Kyrie 3 launched in December, is the top-selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. The LeBron 14 is showing very strong early results, and at the same time the LeBron Soldier 10 remains one of the hottest styles in the category. Also in Q3, the launch of the Paul George 1 saw very strong consumer response. And we continue to drive the demand for basketball with iconic and popular products like the Air Force 1. Modern looks on this beloved silhouette also sold very well in Q3. That includes the Special Field Air Force 1 and the high-energy collaborations with creative brands like Vlone and Acronym, proving yet again Nike’s ability to adapt our most popular styles to serve new audiences.	So, Nike Basketball, fueled by the KD9, the LeBron Soldier 10 and the Kyrie 3, is seeing double-digit market share gains in the $100 to $150 price zone. And with the energy around the PG1, we expect this will only accelerate. And the future remains bright, with a new era of retros kicking off with the first-ever re-release of the LeBron Air Zoom Generation. We believe LeBron, like Kobe and Michael before him, will translate his singular greatness to a long line of product, and with the successful launch of his first retro, consumers clearly agree.	Speaking of Michael, the Jordan Brand continues to lead in elevating performance and sports-style together. We see Jordan’s energy on the court in MVP-type seasons from Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard, and we’re seeing it off the court with several strong sellers in Q3, including the Jordan OVO and our Black History Month collections.	The top performer, however, was the Space Jam 11s. And when I say top performer, I don’t just mean in Q3. The Space Jam 11 was the largest and most successful shoe launch in the history of Nike. This speaks not only to the obvious demand for our products, but also our ability to connect greater numbers of consumers worldwide to the products they covet. At the same time, the Jordan Brand continues its expansion beyond basketball, this time with the University of North Carolina’s football team, and increasingly into the Women’s business with the NikeCourt Flare AJ1.	While we're talking about product, I'd be remiss if I didn’t highlight the success we're seeing in Apparel, whether that’s our Zonal Strength Tights, our popular Plus Sizing line, or Tech Fleece, which continues to sell very well, particularly the Advance Fleece line. Throughout our categories, we are competing on all fronts, attacking opportunities with the cumulative advantages that NIKE has built.	Finally, our global diversification provides unrivaled agility and scale to sustain growth over the long-term. From North America to Western Europe to Greater China, we are running a powerful global offense, where we continue to develop deep relationships and bring excitement to consumers all over the world.	In North America, our brand continues to be incredibly strong. We see it when our most coveted products sell out rapidly on the SNKRS app, when members show up rain or shine at our NIKE Run Clubs, or when we see consumers enjoying premium executions in our stores, and in our partner doors like Foot Locker’s House of Hoops, the Fly Zone and the Fieldhouse at Dick’s Sporting Goods.	And we continue to tap into powerful sport and cultural moments. In Q3, just a few days apart, we delivered at New York Fashion Week and at the NBA All-Star Weekend. Nike and Jordan celebrated Fashion Week with special product drops and targeted retail executions, and then followed it up with special player editions for our deep roster of All-Stars. Our ability to leverage both these events speaks to the distinction of our brand.	Now, while we’re seeing consumer traffic patterns shift by digital disruption, retail consolidation, and increasingly promotional environments, this geography continues to move in the right direction. In Q3, revenue was up 3%, gross margins expanded and inventory declined 8%. And we continue to see that the right product, the right experience and the right brand strategy generates tremendous consumer demand. That said, while we remain focused on strengthening our leadership position, we know we have more work to do to supercharge performance product in North America, particularly in Running. When we see a new market or competitive dynamics within a category, we move quickly to identify the consumer opportunities, and we focus our resources against them.	We’ve proven that this is the right strategy time and again. For example, last year we were losing share in Basketball in North America, and now we’re taking it back. We’re on the offense and we anticipate accelerating growth in performance, in large part fueled by the Air VaporMax’s energy and the upcoming Cushioning Revolution that Mark mentioned.	Around the rest of the world, our brand and business are seeing great momentum. In Western Europe and Greater China, a continued shift to more a active lifestyle is fueling growth. Specifically, in Q3 Western Europe had its 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and Greater China saw its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth.	In Western Europe, we saw growth across nearly all categories, across all territories and across DTC and wholesale, led by Digital. We also reclaimed Western Europe’s #1 position in football footwear, as Nike players dominate the top leagues, scoring more goals than any other brand this season. The market continues to grow at a healthy pace. In Footwear, we saw growth in Running and Sportswear, and in Apparel, we saw broad-based growth led by Sportswear and Global Football.	Now, in China, the opportunity is massive. Just over the past five years, the number of marathons there has grown 500%, and China’s government predicts a sports economy valued at $850 billion by 2025, by far the world’s biggest. Our leading brand position in China gives us confidence we will continue to see real growth from this expanded market.	Indeed, Nike and China have a long history together, and we continue to connect with this growing sports culture. In January, in addition to the Beijing store, the Jordan Brand opened two new Jordan-only stores in Chengdu and Taipei, celebrating the Brand’s 20th anniversary in China. And partners like Topsports and Pousheng are helping drive strong sales by scaling elevated experiences across key cities.	In Q3 we also partnered with tennis star Li Na to introduce a signature line with Women’s Training and Sportswear styles, our first exclusive line for a female Chinese athlete. And additionally, we are looking forward to China hosting the FIBA World Cup of Basketball in 2019, and with our recently announced partnership with FIBA, we can’t wait to work together to grow the sport of basketball internationally.	In the end, the Nike Brand is built to win. We connect consumers with the product and experiences they want, across performance and lifestyle; we strategically balance across a diverse global marketplace; and we lead the pack with groundbreaking retail executions, both in premium brick-and-mortar and pioneering digital commerce. As always, we are on the offence and it's these core strategies that will fuel and extend our leadership position over the long-term.	Thanks. Now here’s Andy.	Andy Campion	Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello to everyone on the call. We are pleased with the results that we delivered in Q3, and, at the same time, we are not satisfied. We are pleased, because we continue to strengthen the fundamental drivers of NIKE’s long-term revenue growth and earnings potential. Our financial strategy has three pillars; delivering strong revenue growth; expanding profitability, and generating high returns on invested capital.	In Q3, we delivered revenue growth in line with the guidance that we communicated 90-days ago. We drove strong double-digit currency-neutral growth in aggregate across our international markets, which now represent more than half of our global portfolio, and we re-positioned NIKE for sustainable, profitable growth in North America long-term. We also expanded profitability, well in excess of our guidance, with EPS growing 24%.	Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of over 33%, and at the high end of our targeted range, by continuing to edit within our core spending, to amplify more focused strategic investment in areas such as product innovation, digital commerce and membership, while also more tightly managing inventory.	Over the past several years, NIKE has become even more fit for growth. On a currency neutral basis, we have built a more efficient and profitable business model. We have sustained momentum in the drivers of full-price gross margin expansion. We have systematically reduced SG&A as a percent of revenue. And we have significantly expanded our currency neutral EBIT return on sales.	But, we are not satisfied. We are clear-eyed with respect to the challenges we have faced and opportunities we have not fully capitalized upon in the short-term. We have and we will continue to attack those opportunities with urgency. We are also obsessing over the triple-double that Mark referenced: doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, doubling our speed to market, and doubling NIKE’s direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. That is the formula we are employing to fuel NIKE’s next horizon of accelerating growth.	As for innovation, we have more than doubled our investment in innovation of late, and you will now see us double the flow and impact of innovation we bring to market, immediately beginning in Q4. We also see tremendous growth potential in doubling our direct connection to consumers. NIKE’s Direct to Consumer business continues to grow much faster than the broader market, and NIKE-branded concepts operated with our strategic partners continue to grow faster than undifferentiated multi-brand stores.	In short, NIKE always wins when we create a home field advantage, that brings together a curated assortment of our products, a NIKE-branded environment, and direct, personal service of the consumers. To be clear, this opportunity is not simply about branded space. It goes well beyond. We see the opportunity to leverage NIKE digital membership to elevate personal service broadly across the marketplace. And, today, NIKE digital members already spend nearly two times what other NIKE consumers spend per transaction.	Identifying, and then aggressively seizing upon these compelling growth opportunities is what we mean when we say NIKE is on the offense, always. But, before I speak to our go-forward outlook in more detail, let’s take a few moments to reflect on the results that we delivered in Q3. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 5%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Greater China, Western Europe and the emerging markets.	Third quarter diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 24% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage, higher other income, a lower tax rate, and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter. Full-priced average selling prices continued to expand. However, margin contracted overall, due to higher product costs, FX headwinds, and off-price sales.	Demand creation decreased 7% to $750 million for the quarter, as our fiscal year spending was front-loaded, due to significant investment around the Olympics and European Football Championships. Operating overhead decreased 1%, as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains within our core operational spending.	The effective tax rate for Q3 was 13.8%, compared to 16.3% for the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As of February 28th, inventories were up 7%, driven by a higher average cost, due primarily to product mix and to support growth of our DTC businesses. Wholesale inventory units were down 3%.	Next, let’s turn to a few of our key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, as we continued to see balanced growth across both footwear and apparel, highlighted by another quarter of strong growth in NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. EBIT growth of 9% outpaced revenue growth as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage delivered increased profitability.	As Trevor detailed, we continue to make great progress in North America, rebalancing supply and demand, reigniting momentum in our Basketball business, and sustaining momentum in Sportswear. That said, the North America retail landscape is not in a steady-state. Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90-days ago. So we are going to remain tight, with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the short-term, while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market, and extend NIKE’s leadership long-term.	Now, turning to our international markets, where we continue to have very strong momentum. First, in Western Europe, revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis, as we delivered another quarter of strong multi-dimensional growth led by our Sportswear, Running and Global Football categories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4%, while EBIT declined 13%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds and higher product costs on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.	In our emerging markets, revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, led by our Sportswear and Running categories. We also saw double-digit growth across most territories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 8%, while EBIT decreased 4% as results continue to be heavily impacted by FX. Last, but certainly not least, Greater China delivered another quarter of extraordinary results with currency neutral revenue growing 15%.	We continue to see strong momentum across the business, with double-digit growth in wholesale and DTC, footwear and apparel, and nearly all categories. China as a nation is accelerating towards sport, both in terms of participation and passion, and urbanization continues at full-speed. With over 350 million Chinese millennials, one of the largest and most important demographics in the world, we believe we’ve just scratched the surface of our growth potential in this important market.	On a reported basis, revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. As evidenced in Q3, we extended our longstanding track record of managing all of the levers within our global portfolio to deliver strong results in the near-term, even amidst volatility. As we look ahead, we will also continue investing and innovating to exceed consumer expectations and fuel long-term sustainable, profitable, capital efficient growth.	As for our specific guidance, in Q4, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, slightly below our Q3 reported rate of growth. On a currency neutral basis, we expect growth in the high single-digit range. We continue to see very strong growth in our international geographies, ranging from Greater China to Europe to emerging markets.	In North America, we have made great progress over the course of this fiscal year, solidifying the fundamental drivers of growth. We are by far the leading and largest brand in North America with a $15 billion growing portfolio. Based upon the breadth and depth of our portfolio, we anticipate that the currently dynamic overall retail marketplace will create both puts and takes in the short-term. So we are being appropriately measured with respect to our Q4 financial targets for North America. We will keep supply tight, maintaining the strong foundation we’ve created, while we bring new innovation to market and accelerate more direct consumer connections.	Shifting to gross margin, 90-days ago, we anticipated less Q4 gross margin contraction versus prior year than we have seen year-to-date. While we were anticipating greater FX headwinds in Q4, we were also expecting to partially offset that with significant expansion in our operational, or currency neutral gross margin versus prior year. Today, we expect the same FX impact that we anticipated 90-days ago. However, based upon the currently more promotional environment in the overall North America marketplace, we do not believe it is prudent to target as much short-term expansion in our operational gross margin. Instead, we are going to maintain the financial flexibility to ensure that we continue to optimize sell-through. Accordingly, we are now targeting 150 to 175 basis points of gross margin contraction in Q4 versus prior year, with the year-over-year variance largely driven by FX.	As for Q4 SG&A, we expect it to be roughly flat versus the prior year, as we continue to systematically drive productivity gains through our Edit-to-Amplify initiative. Other income, net of interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in Q4; and, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.	Note that NIKE Brand futures orders are down 4% on a reported basis versus prior year, and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. As previously discussed, futures are an important part of our operating model, but futures growth is no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth based upon several factors we’ve previously articulated. Illustrating this point, you will see that China futures are growing low single-digits based on changes we have made to our monthly shipment flow globally. However, we continue to project strong double-digit revenue growth in China.	We are in the early stages of our planning for fiscal year 2018, and will provide financial guidance on our next earnings call. Today, I'll share some preliminary thoughts. We are employing a balanced, three-pronged approach to our planning for fiscal year 2018. First, we will remain appropriately measured. Second, we will be sharply focused, attacking the most compelling growth opportunities in the marketplace with speed and agility. And, third, we will be on the offense, executing the triple-double that will fuel NIKE’s next horizon of accelerating long-term growth.	Financially, we are targeting continued revenue growth across all geographies in fiscal year 2018, led by strong growth internationally. We also project significant operating leverage and expanding profitability, which on a currency neutral basis would result in earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial model. That said, at our investor day in October fiscal year 2016, we communicated that we expected FX to be a significant headwind through fiscal year 2018, as our long-dated hedge portfolio matures and rolls forward. And since that time, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most international currencies. At current rates, we project that we will have absorbed $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion of cumulative FX downside over fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, with the most significant annual impact being in fiscal year 2018. We look forward to putting these extreme FX headwinds behind us, as we exit fiscal year 2018. In the meantime, we will continue to deliver strong revenue growth, and make NIKE a much more efficient and profitable enterprise on a currency neutral basis.	In closing, we will continue to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver strong performance in the short-term. At the same time, we will remain relentlessly on the offense, investing, innovating and, in some cases, revolutionizing the industry to exceed consumer expectations, fuel long-term growth and create value for shareholders.	With that, we’ll now open it up for questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.	Bob Drbul	I guess, if you can spend a few minutes on basketball, in terms of what you delivered this quarter and the expectation going forward as a driver. And then just, if you could spend a little bit more time elaborating on China in terms of the futures versus the revenue outlook, and what exactly changed with some of the shipments timings that you’ve talked about?	Mark Parker	Okay. Bob, I’ll take the first one. So on basketball, we continue to see the basketball business strengthen. And there is no doubt that we’re obviously the leader of basketball, and there is incredible energy with our athletes. We see a really strong pipeline of products and we have the ability to continue to grow the game around the world. When we think of basketball, we always think about it as a portfolio NIKE basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. What we've seen is great momentum really across all those dimensions. First on the sportswear side, just to give you a one dimension, the Air Force 1 franchise is doing exceptionally well in the marketplace, and we’re seeing new stuff, like this special field Air Force 1 really become an icon and continue to grow.	The Air Jordan Space Jam 11 which I mentioned earlier broke launch records. Then you have the you have the Kyrie 3, which is now the top selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. When you speak about performance, then you go specifically into the KD9, the LeBron Soldier to handed the Kyrie 3, are all driving double-digit market share gains in the $100 and $150 price zone. And then we’ve added the Paul George and then the LeBron 14. So all-in-all, we have really brought, a really strong focus around basketball. We are clearly focused. We’re on the offense, and we are incredibly excited about the products that we have come in in addition to the NBA partnership that we have on the horizon. So all-in-all, basketball really is just starting to go from strength-to-strength.	Andy Campion	And Bob, I’ll take the China question. The short answer is, the China futures in a low-single-digit range reflects purely timing impacts. As we continue to optimize our management of supply and demand and inventory, one of the opportunities we’ve identified is with the respect to the flow across the three months that comprise a season. And so we’ve made some changes that help us better identify opportunities and capitalize on being in stock in the marketplace. It also has a benefit to us from an inventory management and capital management perspective. We see continued strong double-digit growth in China. In no way do the futures reflect any change in our very bullish view with respect to the tremendous performance that we’ve had, and we continue to expect in China.	Nitesh Sharan	Operator, we’ll take the next question please.	Operator	The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi.	Kate McShane	Thank you. My question – my first question was on the cushioning platforms. I know we typically see these innovations around the Olympics. I was curious about why they’re coming out now instead, and how quickly do you expect to scale these?	Andy Campion	Yes, well, these cushioning systems, all three of them, and in fact there’s four. If you listen carefully, there’s a fourth comfort cushioning system in the works. These have been in development for the past two or three, in some cases, four or five years. This is part of our double the investment in R&D, and we’re really seeing that investment paying off. One of the most important outputs of performance innovation for NIKE is in the area of cushioning. So we see – some of this work actually led up to Rio. The top three finishers in the marathon were all wearing the Zoom X technology, and also in the Olympic trials leading up to the Olympics.	So you’ve seeing bits and pieces of some of this but not out in the market at scale. So we’re basically ready to launch the product, excited about every one of the cushioning systems. They not only create a new level of performance and incredible breakthroughs in the case of the Zoom X, but they also create a whole new aesthetic, which is translatable not only into performance product, but also to the street. So the leveragability and the scalability of these technologies is tremendous. The challenge we have frankly is to make sure that we’re – the focus is on these and we scale these in a way that we can really tell the stories independently. But together, they form what is truly – and I mentioned it, a cushioning revolution for NIKE and the industry. As a product geek, I am incredibly excited about what’s coming in the next six months.	Kate McShane	Okay. Great. And then if I could follow up with your commentary on the North American dynamic, are we really talking about what’s happening in the department store channel? I’m just curious what negative trends continue to persist here when we’re starting to approach the lapping of some of the bankruptcies, and just what’s driving the level of promotion that you’re seeing?	Mark Parker	Yes, well, let me just start at a little broader level. The retail landscape is particularly in the U.S. is not – is in a steady state. I think that’s obvious, undergoing some significant shifts. And those shifts really create some big opportunities and some challenges at the same time. I think the important thing to point out is that these changes are really being driven by the consumer, and consumer demand at the same time remains quite strong. But we know that consumer expectations are quite high in terms of product, the type of product they want, the innovation, the style. They want the product fast, they want it easy, they want personal service. So these are all things that are driving some of these shifts in the marketplace. And that's why we're focused on doubling the output or the cadence of innovation or speed to market so we can be that much more responsive to consumer needs, deliver innovation more quickly, and then doubling our direct connection, to consumers in the marketplace, using or leveraging the power of digital. So again, it's a market that's undergoing a lot of shift and change, but again, I wouldn't trade you our position with anybody. I think we're in a strong position to leverage our strength as a brand, as a Company and we expect to do that.	Nitesh Sharan	Operator, we'll take the next question please?	Operator	The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.	Omar Saad	Thank you, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the Triple Double initiative, especially the speed and pace to market innovation frequency. Maybe help us put this in context, and help us understand the impetus behind this. From an external perspective, it seems to a lot of people in the market that the kind of steeper market shifted in the last couple of years, maybe a little bit away from some of the performance, styles and looks and products that have been the market and maybe a little more towards that street and fashion element. Do these initiatives help you kind of directly address that, and what's the timeframe I think for getting the inventory balance right, along what the market is looking for as you implement some of those initiatives? Or is that not the right way to think about it?	Mark Parker	Well yes. The reason we're putting so much emphasis on this Triple Double strategy is it's going to get us closer to the consumer, and put us in a better position to serve the consumer with the innovation that we're creating, do a better job of editing that product selection and really calling out the key stories. The good news on a macro level is that the consumer appetite for active and sport based products is I think at an all-time high around the world. It's just sort of part of the fabric of everyday active lifestyle. And so the demand for the product is definitely there.	People want more, they want product that obviously performs at a high level, but also looks incredible. It's not an either/or. It's an and proposition. And then want that product fast and they want it easy, at easy access to the product. So our whole initiative is about getting that direct connection strengthened to the consumer and making sure we're in the best position to keep that cadence of innovation moving out to the market as quickly as we can. It also puts us in a position to be more responsive. When we see product that's hot, we can turn that product around a lot quicker and get it to the retailers and to our own -- for our own DTC, to the consumer a lot quicker.	So overall, it's just making us more competitive and more responsive to where the consumers are at. The Express Lane, let me just touch on that, because you asked about speed specifically. There's really three different components of the Express Lane. Fulfill is one, and that means getting product more quickly, restocking product more quickly based on what consumers want, and that's real-time, and that's through sell-through based insights.	Another dimension is what we called update, and that meaning editing materials or colors on popular or existing styles for models based on consumer feedback or insight that we gather. And then the third dimension of it is create, and this is basically creating new products from scratch and bringing them to market with much greater speed. Again, that’s in half the time that we’ve done it traditionally. So that whole end-to-end process is basically being cut in half today from six months down to roughly three months or less. And I think that’s again, it’s going to put us in a much more competitive position.	Andy Campion	Mark. I’ll just add couple of other things. I would just say that what we see from the marketplace is consumers want both great performance, and they want style, and they want those two things together. And I think a great example of that is the product that we’re actually just launching, which is the Air VaporMax, which you’ll see that there are actually different variations to that product; one which is a very clear high performance product, the running shoe and we’ve also got a laceless version, which actually appeals to more of a style perspective. But the shoe in and of itself is both great performance and it’s also superiorly stylish. And so that is what we believe the consumer wants. So when we bring new platforms, you will see us bring more variations, that gives the consumers more choice on the thing that they actually love all the time. Go ahead.	Omar Saad	Sorry, I appreciate that. I appreciate those answers. I also wanted to ask a question about SG&A, if it’s okay. It's been down kind of in dollar terms the last couple of quarters. You guys obviously have had a track record of really over investing to fuel long-term growth. Should we be thinking about the SG&A line differently? Is there something about this era that we're in, where maybe this requires the same spend levels or is that really just lapping kind of the year-over-year Olympics and other activities?	Andy Campion	It’s a great question Omar. To be clear our top priority is investing to fuel long-term growth. So that’s where the dialogue with respect to SG&A or capital expenditure starts at NIKE. But we’ve identified is in over time, our growth has allowed us to invest appropriately, and in some cases in a very ample, maybe even a little more than we necessarily needed to. And I would think about this way. We have existing and new truly differentiating capabilities or competitive advantages in NIKE. Those include things like product innovation, design, digital, brand marketing, including sports marketing and our supply chain, especially the elements of the supply chain that Mark spoke too, the ones that we're looking to get greater speed out of, in service to the consumer. That’s where our focus is on investment.	The other functions that we have within the Company are certainly important, but they’re not differentiate capabilities for NIKE and we look at those other functions as functions where we can optimize our spending, not just for purposes of saving expense, but it actually makes us more streamlined and nimble as an organization. So in some cases, our editing is aligned with shifting business priorities, or with existing business priorities, and in other cases our editing is really a form of zero basing in areas where we believe, we have the opportunity. And that’s what I would call from the financial perspective, my version of Mark's Edit-to-Amplify initiative from a product and business perspective. And we believe that we continue to have opportunity in this regard. Again, if you exclude FX, we've made ourselves much more efficient and profitable over the last couple of years. And we still see opportunity ahead in that regard.	Nitesh Sharan	Operator. We’ll take the next question please.	Operator	The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann.	Lindsay Drucker Mann	I wanted to ask on North America, and maybe a follow-up to Shane’s question. I think a couple of quarters ago, you had talked about the need to de-stock and cleanup the channel, and that as we sort move through that, you had expected revenue in U.S. to accelerate. I’m just curious if you’re – given the commentary on the U.S., specifically on your fourth quarter, how you’re thinking about the timeline to U.S. sales acceleration?	Andy Campion	Hi, Lindsay. It’s Andy. I’ll start on that one. The first part of your question was about what we’ve been talking about over the last several quarters, and we have made great progress in that regard. You obviously saw revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter with inventories declining. That is pretty squarely in the zone of effective and efficient supply and demand management. So we have re-solidified our foundation in that regard.	As Trevor and I think Mark to some extent touched upon, we’ve also solidified the fundamental drivers of growth in North America. Trevor talked about all of the work we’ve done to reignite momentum in Basketball. We have continued momentum in Sportswear. So what we’re referring to when we talk about being measured in the short term in Q4 is the recognition and reality that it’s a promotional marketplace, particularly in North America is, in light of some of the digital disruption that’s going on. I think Kate earlier referred to there, select channels that are more challenged than others.	What we’re most excited about is there are dimensions of the market that are tremendous opportunities. And so as we move into fiscal year 2018, what we’re really focused on is creating a springboard for accelerated growth in North America, again, through the triple double. And in the marketplace, obviously, one of those -- the three doubles is doubling our direct connection to consumers through DTC and our wholesale strategic partners.	Lindsay Drucker Mann	Got it. So to the degree that the environment is disruptive, how do you think about your ability to achieve the long-term revenue growth algorithm in North America that you laid out in your Investor Day? Does the market dynamic make that harder to do?	Andy Campion	Frankly, we’re probably more bullish than ever on the long-term growth projection in North America. And why I say that is it’s becoming even more crystal clear to us that the strategies we’ve been employing to elevate the experience, the personal service of consumers in the market, digital, we’ve been leading the NIKE.com but also membership, we’re seeing much stronger growth in the dimensions of the market where NIKE is connecting with consumers.	Of course, we connect with consumers in our Direct-to-Consumer business. We do it through concepts like House of Hoops, with Foot Locker. And as we said, in each of those dimensions, and when you get down to purely digital membership, we’re just seeing the growth outpace or the sales per transaction outpace. And so we see our way to incredibly strong growth in North America long term. There will be puts and takes in the short term.	Clearly with innovation and disruption, comes both puts and takes. I think by analogy, you might look to greater China. Greater China is a market with extraordinary growth, by really focusing on aligning product, a NIKE-branded environment, both owned and through partners and digital to fuel sustainable sustained growth.	Trevor Edwards	And one other things too I’d just say, that the brand is extremely strong in North America and consumer’s appetite for our brand continues to really be almost unsatisfied. So what we continue to is make sure that we line up the right products in the right environment, and as Andy spoke about, especially when we can do that more direct, and we can connect with the consumers more personally, we find that that continues to really allow us to continue to expand the market and expand our position in the marketplace. So we do feel very confident about North America in the long-term, and we certainly feel that the brand is very strong.	Nitesh Sharan	Thank you, Lindsay. Operator, we'll take our last question please.	Operator	The last question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel.	Jim Duffy	Thank you. Andy follow up for you. Your FX kind a [indiscernible] around those hedge contracts have, but we said the most significant impact in fiscal 2018. Can you elaborate on that please? Maybe help us make sure how much of the $1.6 billion to $2 billion you've referenced will have been absorbed by year end fiscal '17?	Andy Campion	Sure. So as you probably know Jim, and for others, we can't eliminate the impact of foreign exchange. And as you know, over two years ago, we saw significant strengthening of the dollar pretty dramatically and quickly against a lot of international currencies, particularly the euro. And we've seen a lot of volatility over the last couple of years. But largely dollar strengthening. Our hedging strategy is largely using longer dated. So 12 to 24 months out forward hedging to mitigate and delay that impact. So when I spoke to the $1.6 billion to $2 billion of impact over two years, on a rate basis you see those moves happened in the foreign currency impacts immediately. Our hedging strategy essentially steps us down or frankly in the opposite would steps us out, but steps us down to that impact.	The largest single annual impact will be in fiscal year 2018. That said, it hasn't been insignificant in fiscal year 2016 or 2017, it is actually -- the FX impact has been a double-digit negative headwind on EPS growth. So while we continue to deliver strong EPS growth, what we're actually most proud of is that excluding foreign currency, that would be double-digit higher in terms of our growth. So that hopefully gives you a little bit more dimension, but we're not providing a specific forecast as to the impact of FX on fiscal year 2018 today.	Jim Duffy	Fair enough. Considering the headwinds you are facing from FX, are there other areas in the P&L that you hope to use to mitigate that as you look out to fiscal '18?	Andy Campion	Absolutely. And we have certainly done that over fiscal year 2016 and 2017. First and foremost is growth. We are obviously a growth company and in fact with attacking compelling growth opportunities in the market. Long-term obviously is our focus but in the short term as well. I'd say from a margin perspective, the underlying drivers of gross margin expansion are very strong and we see those being very strong in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, again on a currency neutral basis. I mentioned that we continue to see opportunity to become even more fit for growth from an SG&A perspective through Editing to Amplify. And what I would say is most importantly for us in the short term is how we're executing against our long-term strategy. And that's what we’re going to be most focused on as we finalize our plans for 2018 and as we move through 2018, as executing against Triple Double that Mark referenced.	Nitesh Sharan	Thank you, Jim. Okay, I think that’s all the time we have for today. Thank you, guys, for joining us. We’ll speak with you soon.	Operator	This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

7,Fogo de Chao (NASDAQ:FOGO),RIO,Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call,"March 14, 2017 5:00 PM ET","Executives	Stacy Murphy - Investor Relations	Lawrence Johnson - Chief Executive Officer	Barry McGowan - President	Anthony Laday - Chief Financial Officer	Analysts	Joshua Long - Piper Jaffray	Andrew Barish - Jefferies	Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank	Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities	John Ivankoe - JPMorgan	Jason West - Credit Suisse	Operator	Greetings and welcome to the Fogo De Chao Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.	I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Stacy Murphy, Investor Relations for Fogo De Chao. Thank you, Ms. Murphy. Please go ahead.	Stacy Murphy	Thank you. Welcome to Fogo De Chao’s fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call, which is also being broadcast live over the Internet.	Before turning the call over, let me quickly remind you that certain matters discussed such as statements relating to the company’s strategies or guidance are not based on historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described in our press release and the company’s filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.	On the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are provided in the tables of the press release. On our call today, you will hear from Larry Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Barry McGowan, President; and Tony Laday, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.	Now, I will turn the call over to Larry.	Lawrence Johnson	Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our call today. As we saw in our earnings release, we delivered a 11.2% revenue growth for the quarter on a constant currency and 13-week adjusted basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the quarter, U.S. comparable restaurant sales decrease of 1% for the quarter, and U.S. comparable traffic for the year was up 0.5%, marking our third consecutive year of positive traffic.	Also, as you may recall, in November, we were recognized as the best steakhouse in the U.S. by Consumer Reports. Since becoming a public company in June of 2015, we have made considerable progress in our strategic platforms. We have driven traffic through daypart expansion by opening earlier on Saturday and incorporating weekend brunch at our U.S. restaurants.	We have developed our all day value and price optionality with offerings like Gaucho Lunch, which gives our guests the flexibility to choose modified versions of the full experience for reduced price. We have expanded our restaurant base by opening four restaurants during 2016, and over the last 18 months, we have opened a total of nine. Most of these units further penetrated existing markets, which we believe helps cultivate growth in our brand awareness and create more convenient access for our customers.	We have invested in our people by building further bench strength and depth at the restaurant managerial level to provide the necessary support for our future growth. And we continue to demonstrate our culinary innovation with the addition of items, such as our uniquely Fogo brunch dishes and our recently introduced seafood tower. Our initiatives were designed to drive awareness, trial and frequency building traffic over time and we’re pleased with the results to-date.	As I mentioned earlier, fiscal 2016 marked our third straight year of positive traffic gains in the U.S. Compared to our peers, our U.S. comparable traffic for the year was 210 and 160 basis points higher than the Naptrack High-End Steakhouses and Black Box Fine Dining Indexes, respectively. We believe, this demonstrates our ability to generate traffic gains and take market share.	During 2017, we plan to build on the strategic platforms with further innovation and a continued focus on driving operational improvements. Our Brazil business had a busy 2016. We set company records during the summer games, such as serving 11,000 customers in one week at our flagship Rio Botafogo store. We kicked off our Brazil remodel program and introduced new marketing initiatives.	We implemented an all day value menu, giving customers modified versions of the full Fogo experience at a value price at both lunch and dinner. We continue to wet initiatives meant to adapt the business to meet the needs of our Brazilian consumer. While Brazil is an important part of our heritage and authenticity, it continues to be a smaller portion of the overall business, representing less than 15% of our revenues.	As previously discussed, our development strategy emphasizes market penetration balanced with new entries into key DMA within North America. We believe this strategy creates greater awareness for Fogo over the long-term, opportunities for the guests to visit convenient locations and helps us leverage advertising and marketing spend within DMAs.	In the second-half of 2016, we opened Dunwoody, Georgia just outside of Atlanta and King of Prussia in the Philadelphia area. And this year, we have opened restaurants in the Uptown area of Dallas and Tysons, Virginia in the Greater D.C. area. These are all examples of penetrating existing markets, bringing us to a total of seven multi-unit markets in the U.S.	While early in their respective lifecycle, we are pleased with the performance of these stores thus far. A critical building block to our long-term EPS growth is expanding our restaurant base. Over the last three years, we have been able to grow our restaurant base on average over 13% a year, consistent with our long-term growth algorithm.	We will continue to follow a strategy that looks to expand our company-owned restaurant base in the U.S., with a focus on the top 50 DMAs. We currently have five additional signed leases in the U.S. for the next two years of development and several signed letters of intent.	As a reminder, in our new restaurants, we are targeting an AUV of at least $7 million at year three and a 40% cash on cash return. We also believe, our capital like joint venture model remains a significant long-term growth opportunity. Currently, we have two restaurants established in Mexico City. We anticipate opening in the Middle East market with a store in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia later this year, followed by a restaurant in Dubai.	During 2016, we began our remodel program. This asset investment updates the restaurants with a warm contemporary and timeless feel, which appeals to both the millennials and the empty nester. So our Fogo area gains importance allowing us to capitalize on our bar initiatives and emphasize our brand positioning of approachable fine dining.	Barry will discuss some exciting menu enhancements, which allow the guest to use the bar Fogo area as a dinner destination, and or available, we will increase the capacity or flexibility in our seating. We anticipate our remodel program should provide a list to revenue on average of approximately 2% to 3%. During 2017, we anticipate remodeling approximately six additional restaurants in the U.S.	Let me now turn the call over to Barry to discuss the operational strategies driving the business.	Barry McGowan	Thank you, Larry. Our strategy is around daypart expansion, all day value, and innovation are designed to drive awareness, trial and frequency over the long-term by leveraging our core strengths and continuing to enhance our strong value proposition.	To give guests more opportunities to use Fogo at a variety of price points enabling us to continue to outpace the broader industry traffic trends, as Larry mentioned. On a two-year stack basis, Fogo’s overall yearly U.S. comparable sales were up 2.1% and traffic was up 3.5%. Versus our peers, we’re 510 basis points and 440 basis points higher, as measured by Naptrack High-End Steakhouses and Black Box Upscale Fine Dining groups, respectively, on a two-year stack basis.	Our daypart expansion has been deliberate in taste. It started with creating our sales manager role at each U.S. restaurant, so they could build traffic in our shoulder periods. As of November, we opened up our last remaining daypart Saturday to optimize our weekend capacity.	Today, we now have a unique Brazilian Brunch daypart for both Saturday and Sunday, greeting multiple opportunities to experience Fogo during our highest demand weekend dayparts. In April, we introduced the Gaucho Lunch program to give our guest price optionality providing another way for them to customize their experience for great value and leverage the inherent speed and immediacy of our service model.	Our new platforms continue to gain traction and our consumer research shows an increase in frequency to 1.6 visits per year as compared to 1.4 visits just two years ago. Looking forward, the next set of initiatives will be led with innovation around enhancing our existing platforms. Yesterday, we rolled out our most significant bar menu enhancements in the U.S. to-date.	The new Brazilian cocktails and bar bites Happy Hour offers plus seasonal menu additions offer guests three new reasons to experience Fogo. The offerings were designed with everyday occasions in mind and offer uniquely craveable items, such as, Braised Beef Rib Sliders, Brazilian Empanadas, and our new hand-crafted Brazilian inspired cocktails including a Mango Habanero Caipirinha.	On the marketing side, we’ll continue to drive awareness of the brand in current campaigns by utilizing our significant digital footprint over the last several years. In 2017, we will test the effect of layering additional media channels, such as TV, Billboards, and radio in certain multi-unit markets.	The operations team is relentless in their hard work and dedication they bring to the restaurant. We’re thankful for their efforts and continue to be inspired by their passion for taking great care of our guests. While delivering exceptional hospitality, the team continues to push operational initiatives around productivity and waste reduction to partially offset inflationary pressure. Our operating model allows great flexibility in providing guests more choices while improving costs to seasonal innovation.	Looking forward, we anticipate low single-digit labor and commodity inflation in 2017, particularly in the back-half of the year. Additionally, as our newer restaurants continue to ramp, the team remains vigilant and ensuring operational improvements are realized as they drive incremental revenues.	Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to cover the financials. Tony?	Anthony Laday	Thanks, Barry. During the fourth quarter, we reported fully diluted EPS of $0.27 on a GAAP basis and EPS of $0.28 on an adjusted basis. Total revenues were $80.9 million compared to $77.5 million in the prior year, which included $6.8 million of revenue related to the extra week of sales.	The increase in consolidated revenues is due to the incremental sales from our restaurants opened less than 18 months and an exchange rate benefit of $2 million. The revenue growth was negatively impacted by consolidated comparable sales decline of 2% and the $6.8 million impact of the extra week sales included in fiscal 2015.	Revenues increased a 11.2% on a constant currency basis and adjusting for the 14th-week of sales in Q4 2015. U.S. comparable restaurant sales decreased 1%, driven by 0.1% decrease in check and a comparable store traffic decrease of 0.9%. Like the industry, the quarter was negatively impacted by Hurricane Matthew, the Presidential debates, and holiday shifts.	Brazil comparable restaurants sales were down 6.9% for the quarter, reflecting the continued recessionary headwinds, which deepened in the fourth quarter. Fogo has a strong business and tourist customer base, which has been negatively affected by the soft economy.	Although we believe 2017 represents an inflection point that’s supported by the improving economic forecast, the strengthening in the economy is not expected until second-half of 2017. As Larry mentioned, with a focus on U.S. development, Brazil continued to be a smaller portion of the overall business, representing less than 15% of our revenue base.	Food and beverage costs for the quarter were 27.9% of revenues, as compared to 27.8% in the previous quarter. The change is primarily due to new restaurant inefficiencies, which were mostly offset by improvements in commodities and savings generated from waste management initiatives.	Compensation and benefits cost increased 30 basis points over the prior year to 22.3%. The increase is primarily attributable to new restaurant inefficiencies and sales deleverage from lapping the extra week of sales in the prior year. This was mitigated by lower worker compensation expenses and timing of variable compensation.	Occupancy and other operating cost increased $2.3 million to $14.8 million. As a percentage of revenue, this is a 220 basis points increase to 18.3%, primarily driven by the benefit from the extra sales week in the prior year. The remaining difference is mostly due to the higher cost of rent as a percentage of sales in our new restaurants, as these stores are early in the maturity curve.	General and administrative expense decreased $406,000 to $5.2 million. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A decreased 80 basis points to 6.4% compared to last year. The decline is attributable to lower variable compensation costs, partially offset by an investment in key functional areas to support the company’s growth and public company status.	As you may recall, one of our primary components of our long-term growth algorithm is leveraging our G&A as we grow. Our quarterly results demonstrate our ability to deliver on those components. Pre-opening costs decreased $1.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to approximately $1.5 million in the prior year. The decrease is attributable to a shift in the number of fourth quarter openings on a year-over-year basis.	Depreciation expense increased from a $0.9 million to $4.1 million due to the addition of three company-owned restaurants opened during the year and a full-year impact of the four restaurants opened during the prior year quarter.	The effective income tax rate for the quarter is 34.4%, slightly above our anticipated normalized tax rate. However, for the full-year, the rate was 33.1%, which is in line with expectations. The quarter was higher than a full-year due to greater than anticipated income taxes on foreign interest income.	Moving to liquidity, the company generated $56.1 million in cash flow from operations for the year. We completed a $5 million pay down of debt in Q4, bringing our total debt pay down for the year to $15 million. We have $95 million available on our $250 million line of credit, the company’s only debt, and the company had cash on the balance sheet of $31 million. Our healthy cash flows allows us to comfortably fund our pace restaurant development, implement strategic initiatives, and fund our reimage program, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.	Looking forward, we anticipate fully diluted EPS of $0.92 to $0.95 for fiscal 2017, representing a 7% to 11% growth over adjusted diluted net income per share of $0.86 in fiscal 2016. This guidance is based on the following full-year assumptions. We anticipate total revenue of $315 million to $320 million, assuming an exchange rate of R$3.25 Brazilian to the U.S. dollar.	Company-owned comparable restaurant sales are expected to be in the range of down 0.5% to up 0.5%. When considering cadence, the first quarter is negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to Valentine’s Day trading from Sunday to Tuesday and Easter moving to the second quarter.	Also, as a reminder, Brazil benefited from the Olympics, which we estimate to be $1.4 million during the third quarter Additionally, we would expect Brazil sales to improve in the second-half of the year. We expect the restaurant contribution margin of 28.8% to 29.2%.	We anticipate opening up to seven restaurants, including up to two joint venture locations. As such, we would expect pre-opening cost in the range of $3 million to $3.5 million. From a timing perspective, we opened two restaurants thus far during the quarter and would expect approximately $1.7 million to $1.9 million of expense in the first quarter.	We anticipate the remainder of the expense to be primarily in the second and third quarter. We expect general and administrative expense of between $20 million and $22 million. Our capital expenditures, net of tenant improvements are anticipated to be between $26 million and $30 million. We anticipate depreciation to be between $18.5 million to $19 million for the year. We estimate our tax rate to be between 32% and 33%.	Now, I’d like to turn the call back over to Larry for closing comments.	Lawrence Johnson	Thank you, Tony. Fogo is a distinctive brand with a compelling value proposition. Our strategies are designed to drive awareness, trial, and frequency. And we are confident in our ability to deliver EPS growth over the long-term through revenue growth from continued restaurant development in excess of 10% a year on average, coupled with traffic-focused strategies to drive comparable restaurant sales.	As we grow revenue, we will continue to leverage G&A and preserve our four wall margins. We continue to work towards EPS growth of 18% to 20% over the long-term. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And I would like to turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Long of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.	Joshua Long	Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if we might be able to clarify some of the trends coming out of 4Q and then here in the first part of the year, you mentioned that it’s kind of trading day or calendar impact of 50 basis points on Valentine’s and Easter. But I was curious if you might be able to talk a little bit how things trended through 4Q, and then into the first part here of 1Q, just to give us a little bit of additional context?	Lawrence Johnson	Yes, maybe the way to answer that Josh is, we essentially saw a similar pattern to what Nap saw definitely in the fourth quarter and consistent into this quarter as well. So if you’re thinking about kind of just cadence of the quarter in the fourth quarter very consistent with what we saw in Nap, outside of the fact that, obviously, we beat traffic. We beat them relative to traffic with the same kind of cadence.	Joshua Long	Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about some of the initiatives you have in place for early here in the year and then maybe thinking about media spending as well. I think, Barry, you mentioned layering on additional channels. I didn’t know if we should be thinking about that in terms of increase dollars, or maybe similar dollars year-over-year, but just spreading across maybe more digital?	Barry McGowan	Josh, I think the way to think of it is since it is piloting. We’re not allocating much. It’s kind of spread out over some multi-unit markets more or less looking at our mix, as we continue to layer media to understand the effectiveness. So I would say, I wouldn’t read anymore into that than just that.	Now, the effectiveness – if you talk about next year, what we’re leaning into is our new, if you would, our new innovation around current platforms and really driving trial to that. Obviously, we’ve got to expand dayparts and all the price optionality. So we’re leaning into that this year, and we’re just going to record creative engaging content.	Joshua Long	Understood, thank you. In terms of the breaking down the price mix for both the U.S. and Brazil during the quarter, can you give us a little sense of how much pricing you had in place? And then maybe your thoughts on how that might progress over the course of the year?	Barry McGowan	You bet. So in the U.S. for Q4, we’re roughly around just about 1.5%, Brazil was between about 4.5% to 5%. And if you think about that going into next year, it’s probably about the same.	Joshua Long	Great. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. The next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead.	Andrew Barish	Hey, guys. Just on your inflationary outlook low single digits for commodities, is that based on some contracting you’re doing, or just what you’re seeing in the market with your specific cuts? And is that a number that could shift around a little bit depending on some of the new menu stuff you’re doing in terms of how that impacts the overall commodities?	Barry McGowan	Yes. Best way to think of it, it’s really what we see is never rebuy and spot buy frequently and we buy box needs. So buying patterns are different than market. So what we’re seeing is some of our cuts are going up. And obviously, we’re doing obviously, these new items and new price points. So we see that impact as well.	But obviously, we’re looking at contracts we have secured picanha, which is our largest selling cuts, we secured that for the year, that’s favorable, the other costs we’re continuing to monitor. But right now, we’re just being prudent to say, our basket of goods are going to be probably low single-digit inflation.	Andrew Barish	Okay. And does it make sense as you start to lap all the major initiatives here in 2017, with Gaucho Lunch and some of the weekend stuff that the negative mix impact starts to lessen a little bit as we go through the year, is that the right way to kind of think about things?	Barry McGowan	Yes, exactly. So we started Gaucho Lunch in April, so if we think as we start to lap that, that will kind of offset, but if you’ll see some the lapping and mix will balance our products.	Andrew Barish	Okay. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you The next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.	Brett Levy	Good afternoon. I know you talked a little bit about the competitive landscape. Can you share a little bit more what you’re seeing geographically by market size? And also, now that you have seven markets, what are you seeing as the difference between their performance – the existing store performance, the new store performance, what are you learning, what do you think you need to do differently?	Lawrence Johnson	I think, Brett, this is Larry. I think that what we see and we really have seen it as we’ve gone multi-unit markets is that performance tends to be consistent across the markets. And I think what we are very mindful of is continuing to build out that footprint passionately. So that, we don’t get over weighted in any given market, but performance tends to be very similar.	Barry McGowan	Hey, Brett, I’ll add one piece of color on that. I know Larry mentioned just, we talk about frequency as well. So and part of the strategy again is convenience. So we model in the penetration, again, we’re not going deep in every market, as Larry has already outlined. But as we enter the market, our brand awareness, we’re investing in further brand awareness. But we have seen, again, our frequency go from 1.4 to 1.6 times that is partially attributed to us growing to multi-unit we see that frequency pickup.	Brett Levy	Just one follow-up to that. What kind of cannibalization are you seeing in those markets? And then just if you could share a little bit more color on breaking down your daypart, how your lunch business, weekend business, and the tests on these Saturday shoulder performance? Thank you.	Lawrence Johnson	I’ll answer the first part on the cannibalization. So we anticipate and expect to see about a 2% impact from a cannibalization perspective on our existing restaurants. One of the things for us, as we look at restaurants, we really try to look at that over a 12 to 18 months to really understand what we’re seeing from a cannibalization perspective. But in the initial stages with that first full-year, we’re expecting two, and we’re seeing on average similar that kind of number.	Barry McGowan	Then Brett, on the second part is the dayparts. So obviously, from the daypart lunch, our brands stood about 15%, 16% launch. So we’re obviously focusing on the lunch capture rate with a Gaucho Launch leveraging our immediacy of the brand and our value proposition. So competitive to peer, we’re seeing good opt-in rate. So we’re very excited about that proposition.	And overall, as you know, where the consumer is, what everybody has felt in this choppy market consumers cautiousness around, I guess, dinning out. Everybody is still probably more frequency on the first part of the week, where over 2.5 years ago we began our daypart expansion on weekend. So we’re seeing tremendous pickup and offset to our weekend daypart expansion. But overall, we see growth on both parts, obviously, our third year positive traffic, we think is primarily driven by frequency and that expansion.	Operator	Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.	Jeff Farmer	Great, thank you. You guided to, I believe, it was low single-digit labor cost inflation in 2017. I think that’s one of the lowest number we’ve seen. Companies have provided that guidance across the 4Q earning season. So I’m just curious what gives you confidence in that number? I know I think in the last earnings call, you pointed just to productivity opportunities, but any color across all those things would be helpful?	Barry McGowan	You bet. So just on a overall context, we see continued improvement productivity in our rows, our new restaurants ramping to improvement. But also just our productivity initiatives in general just continually focusing on a labor management, guest flow, scheduling, and I would say, really more effective training on the upfront side.	So we’re seeing some real benefit there, especially in the back-of-the-house around the butchering standards productivity and track back-of-the-house areas where we’re starting to see further pickup. We’re going to continue to press that. We understand the headwinds. But kind of what we experienced this year is low single-digit, if you would, 2% inflation, we’re expecting between 2% and 3% this year. And that’s, I would say, after all sets, obviously, we’re focused to continue to take our – what I would say, a very unique operating model and really optimize it.	Jeff Farmer	Okay. That’s helpful. And then I believe just looking quickly at the press release, it looks like a 170 basis points between few restaurant level margin pressure for the full-year – for the full-year 2016 versus 2015. Just curious how much of that was driven by that modest same-store sales decline for the system? And how much of that is really the headwinds from new restaurant inefficiencies, how should we be thinking about those since they weigh on largest…?	Anthony Laday	Yes, I would, Jeff, this is Tony. So I would say, its kind of an 80%, 20% thing, with 80% of that driven by inefficiencies of the new restaurants.	Jeff Farmer	Okay. Okay, that’s helpful. That’s it for me, guys. Thank you.	Barry McGowan	Great. Thanks, Jeff.	Operator	Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.	John Ivankoe	Hi, thank you. I think just a couple of follow-ups at this point. Firstly, Tony, I know you mentioned that your overall sales trends for following Nap maybe just for the benefit of the trends and everyone on the phone giving calendar shifts whether your geographic exposure. How are you feeling about the first quarter overall considering or so far into it, not both in the U.S. and Brazil, as we shift models?	Anthony Laday	That’s a very good question, John. We historically have not discussed kind of in a quarter comp sales. One thing I would say that, we’re confident and it’s our ability to continue to drive traffic better than our peers. So I’d – I’ll leave at that from a Q1 perspective. And I think, you had a second part of that question, which was kind of regional pressures or regional softness.	John Ivankoe	Well, not or regional strength for that matter I mean, obviously, you have restaurants all over, you have some concentration, but also a good amount of diversity as well?	Anthony Laday	Yes. So we’re still seeing some softness in the Texas kind of region. Houston still very impacted and then and obviously, like anybody else, we’re still seeing travel from a – potential impacts from travel this week. And so we’ll see what that ends of being, but that’s not necessary region, I guess, it will, it is from a Northeast perspective that we expect to see some weather impacts there.	John Ivankoe	Okay. And the next question is really on your long-term earnings growth rate. Now, you certainly you’ve articulated 18 to 20, and I think a lot of it can see the building blocks that’s how we get there. 2017 is not one of those years.	So when you ask us to think about what long-term mean to when long-term you really get to be materialized in the actual earnings results themselves, I mean, if you kind of give us a view maybe from your strategic plan in the next couple of years when that 18% to 20% against materialize, because that 18 and 19 is beyond that? And I guess at this point, what’s really necessary for that long-term earnings growth to start occurring in the numbers?	Anthony Laday	No, I think you’ve got that right. So as we look through kind of our long-term plan over the next five years and look at our strategy to drive that growth to 18% from an EPS perspective. We’re really looking at that being kind of a 2019 type ability to drive that at that point in time. And we see the path in terms of the development we have, the growth that we’ve been doing, and the work that we’ve done to continue to improve margins on new restaurants.	John Ivankoe	Okay, thanks very much. Helpful. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. And the next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.	Jason West	Yes, thanks. A couple of things. One, I may have missed this, but, Barry, I think you mentioned the two-year traffic in the U.S. What was the one-year traffic in 4Q in the U.S.? I know, we have 1.5 price I think [it can get to mix front] [ph]?	Barry McGowan	Yes. So traffic was down 0.9 basis points on a consolidated basis for Q4.	Jason West	Does that include Brazil?	Lawrence Johnson	Absolutely, yes.	Barry McGowan	Yes, that does. And it just so happens that that’s a very similar for U.S. as well.	Jason West	Okay. So down 90 basis points for the U.S. and traffic, okay?	Barry McGowan	Right.	Jason West	And can you remind us where we are exactly on the roll out of the Saturday dayparts? I know last quarter you talked about early openings, and then on this call, you mentioned Saturday brunch. I think those are two different things, right? So where are we exactly on those – on the roll out of those two?	Lawrence Johnson	You bet. So really if you just simplify Saturday really came online end of November this year. So, the brunch or platforms are really more marketing platform initiative, so really the daypart expansion came on fully by November around the end quarter.	Jason West	Okay. So prior to that point, you had not been opening for brunch on Saturday, right?	Lawrence Johnson	That’s correct.	Jason West	And so that that’s like 11 – do you open up 11 now in Saturdays for all your restaurants?	Lawrence Johnson	That’s correct.	Jason West	Okay.	Lawrence Johnson	11 – some restaurants have 11, 30, between 11, 30.	Jason West	Okay, gotcha. Yes, I guess, last thing, the consensus numbers were quite a bit lower in the U.S. and then where you ended up, which is good. I don’t remember if you’d given specific guidance on what to do there in 4Q? But was there anything that surprise you to the positive in the quarter? I mean, was the quarter pretty much in line with your models, or any thoughts there might be helpful?	Barry McGowan	I think the surprise is pretty similar to the other folks in just terms of the choppiness that we saw in the fourth quarter, with the quarter getting much better at the end of the quarter.	Jason West	Yes. So you had a strong finish to the year, right?	Barry McGowan	Absolutely, yes.	Jason West	And the New Year’s Eve fell in the same period both the years, so it wasn’t much of a [Multiple Speakers]	Barry McGowan	No, it wasn’t [indiscernible]. Yes, not a shift in there, in fact, we thought that was going to be a headwind just because of the date shift – the day shift.	Jason West	Right, right, but – okay. Okay, good stuff. Thanks, guys.	Barry McGowan	Yes.	Operator	Thank you. At this point, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.	Lawrence Johnson	We want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and for the follow-up questions, and look forward to answering any additional questions. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you.

8,Kopin Corporation (NASDAQ:KOPN),RIO,Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call,"March 13, 2017 8:30 a.m. ET","Executives	Rich Sneider - Treasurer and CFO	John Fan - Chairman and CEO	Analysts	Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities	Jeff Bernstein - Cowen & Company	Operator	Greetings, and welcome to the Kopin Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.	It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rich Sneider, Treasurer and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.	Rich Sneider	Thank you, Operator. Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. John will begin today's call with a discussion of our strategy, technology, and market; I will go through the 2016 fiscal fourth quarter and year-end results at a high level, John will then conclude our prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take your questions.	I would like to remind everyone that during today's call, taking place on Monday, March 13, 2017, we will be making forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the company's current expectations, projections, beliefs, and estimates and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.	Potential risks include, but are not limited to, demand of our products, operating results of our subsidiaries, market conditions, and other factors discussed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements made during today's call.	And with that, I'll turn it over to John.	John Fan	Thank you for joining us this morning to discuss our results. We have made good progress this past quarter. We announced very important partnership agreements with Goertek and Lenovo New Vision, and we've made great showings at the CES [ph], in January.	In addition, we received four CES Innovation Awards. They are our 2K by 2K OLED display microdisplay for VR, our Pupil Optic optical modules for AR, our Whisper Voice Chip that significantly improves the automatic speech recognition to accuracy in noisy environment, and our Solos smart glasses for sports. These partnerships and new products have positioned Kopin for substantially increase revenue in late 2017 and beyond.	We must say that we are excited, and proud of what we have achieved. All me to explain more in details what has happened. It is important to stress we're particularly excited about our opportunities in Asia. I just came back 10 days ago from a two weeks trip in Asia. And it's clear our views are aligned well with many Asian global companies for both AR and VR opportunities. The key for user acceptance of AR and VR is mobile. As we have said all along, the headsets need to be small, lightweight, comfortable, and attractive. The initial products should be focused to clear and value-added vertical applications, with preference to us being accessories to smart phones.	Furthermore, touch is really not preferred interface in wearables. Voice would be the next user interface, and speech recognition will be wildly used. However, speech recognition has to be very reliable in any environment. Our technology and our visions address those challenges very well.	Let me discuss what's happening in OLED microdisplays. We had stress [ph] for a while for many VR applications the preferred microdisplays are OLED displays. In this year's CES, we introduced Kopin's new Lightning OLED microdisplays. This new one-inch display panel has a high resolution of 2048 by 2048, and a fast 120 hertz frame rate, which are the first for VR industry. It has dramatically raised the bar on performance and size. The resolution is now three to four times higher than currently available. The panel size many times smaller. The current frame rate and latency effect that has often caused users discomfort can now be overcome by this display.	Our Lightning protected by 10 patents pending, also have low power consumption, and is capable to upgrade to even higher resolution necessary for future high-end VR products. Furthermore, Kopin introduced and produced this revolutionary display using an OLED industry first; a surplus and vast scalable model for both the silicon backplane and OLED fun pad [ph].	The established model enables Kopin to provide auto microdisplays to the market rapidly. We now plan to introduce OLED display products later this year. The potential of our 2K by 2K OLED microdisplay cannot be underestimated. The responses at CES and the following one-on-one meetings in the U.S. and Asia with more than a dozen global VR companies, confirmed that the new OLED display has now make a giant leap to work for VR.	The realization of a more compact higher performance and lightweight VR headset is done here. One can expect such game-changing headsets with this revolutionary OLED display will be strong later on this year. Kopin now supplies LCDs, LCOS, and OLED microdisplays, plus associated innovative optical modules providing a full suite of microdisplays for military, industrial, and consumer electronic segments. In the coming era of AR and VR microdisplays will be needed, and Kopin is ready.	Now let's discuss Solo. This is a very good example of AR-focused display. It is truly mobile AR headsets using our innovative tiny Pupil display modules, providing a sunlight-readable [ph] heads up digital image while it is see-through. As we have stated for AR applications, our super bright tiny LCD cyber displays are very well matched with our Pupil Optics. Initially, Solos are focused for serious cyclists. But it will also be very useful for many other sports. Solos headset has been used by our Olympian cyclists in their training for the last year Rio Olympics, and they won two silver medals at Rio.	This lightweight, well-balanced heads-up sunglasses provide digital data during rides, such as miles, speed, cadence, heart rate, elevation, calories, directions among others. The headset syncs with android phones, iPhones, and microsensors, and can receive any phone calls. We have initiated a crowd funding campaign so as to ship to early adopters and need to collect feedback for our future enhancements.	All certifications have been passed for US and some selected international countries. We have begun shipping. The response so far has been very good. To scale up to much larger volumes, we have just arranged to move one of manufacturing of Solos to Goertek. Many of you probably do not know of Goertek. It is a large Chinese public company with global reach. It's actually one of the world largest audio device companies and is world's largest manufacturer of AR/VR headsets and audio wearables such as smartwatches.	It may be difficult to name well-known headsets that are not manufactured by Goertek. Revealed Goertek's keen appreciation of products and technology is truly satisfying. Goertek not only was closely with us to manufacture Kopin's products such as the Solos and adopt our displaying audio components products in the offering, also invest and acquired 10% of our stocks. The stock transaction is scheduled to be completed at the end of this March.	Our Whisper chip and technology, protected by Sony patent issues and pending [ph] enables voice interface to be very reliable and dependable. Last year with the success of Amazon ECHO and Google Home, it is clear that voice will become a primary user interface and speech recognition capabilities will be applied to wearables.	So far, the voice has been on the frustrating side. It is great when it works, but it can be awful in various types noisy environments. Our Whisper chip effectively handles speech recognition in any type of noisy environment. This technology has been proven in a military and enterprise world we are now -- we are working with consumer product companies with innovative technology.	After many months of testing with global companies, the data has definitely proved that Whisper technology is far superior to any other existing technologies for voice recognition in noisier environment. As consumers increasingly choose voice over touch as a preferred interface to electronic devices, the opportunity for Kopin's Whisper technology is vast.	The Whisper chip is currently designed into four products that go into production later on this year. In fact Whisper's chip is also key to our new partnership with Lenovo New Vision, an announcement we made at CES. Lenovo New Vision was formed to develop and produce AR smart headsets for enterprise. This new product will include Whisper Chip as well as our micro display optics and software. Combining Kopin's technology with Lenovo's precision as a global solution provider will allow us to accelerate the commercialization of AR products around the globe.	There are so many developments going on. We continue working no additional partnership and we are in multiple discussions on how to distribute our innovative component products as well as our AR/VR finished products. We look forward to sharing details later on this year as they develop. As always, we are careful in protecting our intellectual properties in the wearable technology so that we can maintain and monetize our leadership position in the years to come.	In 2006, we had 37 granted patents, submitted 30 patent applications, and ended the year with more than 300 patents. We also continue to provide military business. The F-35 fighter jet is ramping on schedule. And we believe the momentum behind this program will accelerate. We will also ship products this year under the FWSC and FWSI [ph] and look for all these programs to be multi-year opportunities for Kopin.	At the same time, our historical leadership in providing avionics and [indiscernible] to U.S. military should benefit Kopin with a new administration focus on increasing US military strength. As a source of the supplier of optics and display for many military programs, Kopin is excited by its position and opportunity.	And finally, we continue to make progress across other programs. I have discussed in the past including drone racing and health and fitness and safety applications. While some of the early excitements around AR/VR may have slowed resulting in some doubts and re-examination of the whole category, however, we do believe the AR/VR provides unique values and experiences to users. We and our partners believe we are on the right track. Our products and technology will enable the AR/VR to re-emerge providing an exciting future for Kopin.	We that, I am going to Rich.	Rich Sneider	Thank you, John. Beginning with the results for the quarter, total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were 6.4 million compared with 4.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in quarter revenue year-over-year was primarily driven by sales of our products used in military and industrial applications.	Cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 72% of product revenues compared with a 103% for the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement was due to fact that industrial and military products of higher gross margins than the other products.	R&D expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 3.8 million compared with 3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially flat. SG&A expenses were 4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared with the same quarter of 2015 was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation and professional fees.	Other income and expense was income of 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared with 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included approximately 1 million of gain from the payment of an amount held in escrow from a previously sale of an investment. The fourth quarter of 2015 also included a gain of approximately 1.2 million from the sale of an investment. The fourth quarter of 2016 includes approximately 900,000 of foreign currency gains as compared to approximately 600,000 of foreign currency losses in 2015.	Turning to the bottom line, our net loss for the quarter was approximately 5.2 million or 8 cents per share compared with a loss of 6.8 million or 11 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning to results for the full year, total revenues for 2016 were 2.6 million compared with $32.1 million for 2015. Revenues from the sales of products for military applications declined from $10.2 million in '15 to $5.2 million in 2016 as a result of the anticipated declining sales of our products for use in thermal weapon sights.	We are, as John mentioned, currently in the successor program, the Family of Weapon Sight Program which is programmed to ramp over the coming year. Sales of our products for wearable application decreased from $12.3 million in '15 to $7.4 million in 2016 as a customer decided not to target its product at consumer market. Cost of goods sold for 2016 was 84% compared with 76% of product revenues for 2015. Decline was due to the under absorption of fixed overhead costs due to lower sales.	R&D expense in 2016 was $16.0 million compared with $17.76 million in 2015. The decline in R&D expense year-over-year was primarily driven by lower funded R&D. SG&A expenses were $17 million for 2016 compared with $18.1 million for 2015. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in patent amortization expenses. In June of 2016, we completed the sale of our Korean facility and recognized a gain of $7.8 million.	Other income expense was income of approximately $500,000 for 2016 as compared with $10 4 million for 2015. 2015 included approximately $9.2 million gain from the sale of investments. 2016 includes approximately $700,000 of foreign currency losses as compared to 2015, which has approximately $400,000 foreign currency gains. The 2016 other expense also includes approximately $500,000 from the loss from the embezzlement at our Korean subsidiary.	Turning to the bottom line, our net loss for 2016 was approximately $23.4 million or $0.36 per share, compared with a net loss of $14.7 million or $0.23 per share for 2015. 10% customers for 2016 were Rockwell Collins at 12%, and [indiscernible] at 20%. Fourth quarter and year-end amounts of depreciation and stock compensation are attached in a table to the Q4 and year-end press release.	Turning to 2017, we're not providing guidance due to lack of visibility inherently in any new developing market, like wearables, however just to give you a sense of what we see developing we expect revenue to be backend loaded as the products John discussed ramp in the fourth quarter. We believe operating expense will remain largely flat with 2016. We conclude the year with approximately $77 million of cash and marketable securities. And as we previously discussed, we've entered to an agreement to sell approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock for $24.5 million. The sale of the shares is subject to government approval, which we anticipate we'll receive this quarter.	We have no long-term debt. We continue to maintain a very strong cash and marketable security position in order to execute our strategy. Finally, we are delinquent in the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three-month ending period September 30, 2016 due to the discovery of an embezzlement at our Korean subsidiary. We expect to file both our Form 10-Q and our Form 10-K shortly. And with that I'll turn it over to John.	John Fan	Thank you very much. And we are open now for Q&A. Thank you.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Robison from Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed with your question.	Matt Robison	Thanks for the overview. Can you comment on if you've had any follow on orders on the wearables side and it looks like Goertek investment was delayed, I think there was discussion of closing at the end of January, can you indicate is there any other factors besides government approval in the delay? And then if you could, just for housekeeping, give the CapEx and depreciation for the fourth quarter.	John Fan	Okay, I will answer the question on Goertek thing, I just came back, as I mentioned, 10 days ago from Goertek. And the delay, if you call it delay, is the government, as will know, starting January this year slowed down the export of moving the money out of the country in China. So they told me everything is fine, and everything should be done by the end of this month.	Matt Robison	By the end of this month?	John Fan	Yes.	Rich Sneider	Matt, what were the housekeeping questions? CapEx was…	Matt Robison	The other two questions were just the usual deprecation CapEx, and then what to the extent that you had follow on orders from any customers that were in the wearable. I know that last year you had some initial production orders in the first quarter and the third quarter. And we're kind of interested to hear if there are follow on orders from those customers.	Rich Sneider	Yes, well, I mean, we continue to have wearable sales to a variety of folks in a variety of programs. Don't know if there's a specific. I mean, the decrease is obviously last year we had expectation -- when I say last year, '15, expectations of a large program with Google that didn't materialize, that's really the decline. But with the rest of the customers we continue to ship. With regards to the cleanup questions, depreciation amortization was 44,000 in the fourth quarter, and CapEx was actually a negative number due to translation of a few thousand dollars.	Matt Robison	Actually, your revenue was a little bit higher than I was expecting because I was not expecting any follow on orders of significance to the degree that you had last year in the first quarter and the third quarter. So I was just kind of curious if you had -- if any of those customers had started to see some significant uptick from the market from their initial production activities so they were coming back and ordering more…	John Fan	Yes, I think maybe I'll make a comment, Matt, is that we do see still pretty strong growth in the drone racing, and that area is also very strong in the wearable. And we also now notice that, as we will know, the wearable, especially the VR AR headset has gone through with these reexaminations, Rich mentioned about Google, it's one of them, but there are quite a few of them. I think that particular reexamination is over. I think a new set of products will be coming out and will certainly be involved in many of them. And I think the product will be simpler and more accessory to the smart phones, and I think it's more -- I actually think it's more in tune what is needed right now. So we very optimistic, I think everybody now realign again.	Matt Robison	Okay, that sounds practical. Does it change your role in terms of components versus reference designs versus IP and combinations thereof? Or I guess a simpler way to ask that would be, would this accessory orientation do you see more or less content or is it just essentially the same?	John Fan	Well, I think the content, especially with Goertek is a -- Goertek is a very big audio company, so they certainly appreciate our Whisper Chips, and they also have the biggest AR/VR headset, and they really think that they totally believe what we have on the display and optics are the key for the AR/VR. So everything is going online now. We are now working with the biggest company who are manufacturing AR/VR headsets and audio products. And they are also investing in our company.	Matt Robison	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Jeff Bernstein from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.	Jeff Bernstein	Hi guys, congratulations on traction you're getting. A couple of quick ones, any update on the Hitachi Maxell battery technology and where you think that's going.	John Fan	Yes, this is John Fan. And we were also in Asia. As I mentioned, there was a meeting with them. They are making quick progress. Now we are in the midst of deciding how to get the manufacturing line going. I didn't discuss in this earning call because we have so many other things to talk about. But I am glad you asked. Things are going well there too.	Jeff Bernstein	And is power as big of an issue on OLED side? Or, is it less important?	John Fan	Power is one of the features. Currently as you will know, the headsets that usually tethered into a PC system or into a PlayStation. In this case, power is not so important except that those headsets are very hot, and people don't like to be hot on your face, on your head. So, that initially is still a issue. But when it goes [ph] to mobile case, now power becomes very useful and important. So, we just have to solve the problem in several things.	I do believe at the end, it should be in mobile world. It should be tethered into a smartphone, not to a PC system. The market is maybe 5, 10 times bigger. And so, our belief is the same thing. So, OLED actually in many way enable this lower power, smaller sized, faster, higher resolution. Everything that's what's now the -- our first generation headset people are facing challenges. And we in many ways resolve, especially we are so very well respected [ph] and everybody want to talk to us. But in addition to that, I think it's clear that with this 2k x 2k, which is the world's first, but the fact that we can do OLED by using a totally a fabless model actually as I say, we will enter all the microdisplay in a very big way by the end of this year.	Jeff Bernstein	And so, John, just to make sure I understand correctly on the battery side, obviously bar has increased very significantly on battery safety just in the last 18 months or so, you feel like the Hitachi Maxell technology has now tested out?	John Fan	Yes, the question but, Jeff, is that the safety. Safety is definitely issue. Everybody is sensitive to it, especially to wearable on your body. I can tell you this, that battery technology that particular battery has passed all the certifications already.	Jeff Bernstein	Terrific. And then, you mentioned that you'll be shipping for revenue on the FWSC. So I guess that you were having a development contract at first and there is a bake off with a competitor, can you just give us more detail on what your win was? And, you are the majority winner of this contract or the minority winner?	Rich Sneider	Hi, Jeff, Rich. We received from one of the selected prime contractors a contract for engineering manufacturing development for the weapon side assembly and head mounted display. And we will begin delivering initial units later this year with follow-on units in 2018. And then, production in 2019, and then, it will continue and ramp to several thousand units per year by 2020. That's the current program of record.	Jeff Bernstein	Okay. And so, you have won the award?	Rich Sneider	Well, we have been selected by one of the primes.	Jeff Bernstein	Got you. Okay, so now the question is whether you get this sort of majority or minority of the units and that's to be determined later?	Rich Sneider	Right. And we saw this in the thermal weapon side program even though we probably shipped 99% of them in Syria, there was always a stock [technical difficulty] to keep you honest.	Jeff Bernstein	Yes, okay. All right, great. And then, any update on the Scott Sight, it was one of the earlier interesting enterprise kind of commercial kinds of applications in AR and understandably the procurement for that kind of a thing is maybe not as straightforward as a consumer type products? Any update on what you've seen in the Scott Sight for fire fighters.	Rich Sneider	Sure. So, without giving in too much information really Scott Safety should be providing. But I can tell you from our side the unit went out, it was very well received, but there will be a redesign as you would expect that sort of first power units, and so we're working on V2, as we speak.	Jeff Bernstein	Got you. Great, thanks very much.	Operator	Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.	John Fan	Yes, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look-forward to providing future updates very soon. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

And I’d like to thank all of you for joining us this morning.	Tahoe Resources had a record year in 2016 with the highest cash flow per share in our Company’s history. We also achieved all of our 2016 guidance. And looking at our operations, we had record production for both silver and gold, and our lowest ever per ounce cost at Escobal. We strongly believe that improving financial performance on a per share basis is the key to creating long-term value. In 2016, we achieved strong growth in both cash flow and adjusted earnings per share, at the same time that we integrated and acquired assets and developed projects and our stock price -- I’m sorry. Our stock price underperformed in 2016, but with strong near-term growth and low-cost production and one of the world’s greatest silver mines, we’re well-positioned to significantly improve our share price performance going forward.	2016 was a transitional year for Tahoe, and we took a number of very important steps towards growing annual production to our goal of 550,000 ounces by 2020. On April 1, 2016, we acquired Lake Shore Gold. Through that deal, we added 170,000 to 180,000 ounces of annual production in Canada with very attractive growth opportunities. We are well-advanced on our first major project in Timmins, the sinking of the Bell Creek shaft. This project is expected to add 40,000 ounces of annual production at Bell Creek and at least double the mine life. It’s going very well, and we’re on track for completion by the middle of next year scheduled.	On May 1, 2016, we achieved commercial production at Shahuindo at a production rate of 10,000 tons per day. Shahuindo is well on its way to becoming a very-productive low-costs heap leach mine. By the second half of next year, we expect to be producing at the rate of 36,000 tons per day with gold recoveries of at least 80% for our crushed and agglomerated ore. In 2019, we’re targeting production of 200,000 ounces of gold for Shahuindo.	Looking at 2016 gold production, we produced 385,000 ounces, which achieved our guidance. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs beat our target ranges, and our strong cost performance was particularly satisfying, when you consider that we had major capital projects underway at two of our operating mines. In our silver business, Escobal had a record year with silver production of just over 21 million ounces. We also had our best cost performance ever with all-in sustaining costs of just over $8 per ounce.	Turning to the fourth quarter, we had a very strong operating performance, particularly on the gold side of our business, driven by our best quarter ever in Timmins and best quarter since Lake Shore deal. Gold production of 120,000 ounces was a quarterly record. We also achieved total cash cost below $600 an ounce and all-in sustaining costs below $950.	Q4 financial results were affected by declining metals price environment. We also had non-cash, non-recurring items and higher expenses in a few areas that negatively impacted the fourth quarter earnings. While we’re not satisfied with the less than expected earnings, I’m pleased that we were able to continue to generate cash from our operations in spite of the low prices we saw in the fourth quarter.	Just before turning the call over to Liz McGregor, our CFO, I want to talk a little more about guidance. We recently finalized our plans for crushing and agglomeration at Shahuindo; and with that, we’re in a position to lay out our capital expenditure plans for the next few years. As a result, yesterday, we released three-year guidance for capital expenditures, as well as production costs, and expected levels of expiration spending and corporate G&A. Following the financial review, I’ll go over the guidance in same detail and provide a sense of how each of our key assets contributes to our future plans. What I’ll say now is that our new guidance clearly highlights the fact that our growth plans are on track. By late next year, Tahoe is expected to be 0.5 million ounce gold producer with low capital requirements and cash and all-in sustaining costs and position to generate substantial free cash flow.	With that, I’ll turn the call over to Liz McGregor, our CFO.	Elizabeth McGregor	Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone.	As Ron mentioned, Tahoe reported record cash flow in 2016. Our cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, totaled $386 million or $1.33 per share. $1.33 per share represents an increase of 22% over 2015. Earnings for 2016 were $118 million or $0.41 per share, which compares to a loss of $72 million or $0.35 per share in 2015, and that included a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $153 million. Adjusted earnings for 2016 were $180 million or $0.62 per share, which were up 82% and 29%, respectively from the prior year.	I want to mention that there is a lot of noise in the earnings numbers and I will go through some of the details in a moment. First, so, I would like make general comment about the impact of our acquisition of operating assets on our earnings.	When we completed our acquisitions in both 2015 and 2016, we were confident that with existing gold prices, the acquired operating assets would quickly begin to contribute to our cash flow per share, and we did have record cash flow performance in 2016. We also understood that the accounting treatments required to fair value operating assets would result in higher depreciation and have an impact on earnings. In our view, that trade-off was and still is worth it, given the attractive growth in gold production we now have before us, a significant exposure we have to higher metal prices as well as the current cash flows being generated from the operations.	So, turning now to the earnings. We had solid growth in adjusted earnings in 2016, mainly due to strong revenue compared to the previous year. Gold in doré sales more than doubled to 351,000 ounces in 2016, as a result of the acquisition of Lake Shore on April 1st, including a full year production from La Arena and eight months of commercial production at Shahuindo. As a result, revenue of $785 million in 2016 was 51% higher than the 520 million reported in 2015. We also had a slightly positive impact from metal prices during the year with our realized gold price averaging $1,245 per ounce in 2016 compared to $1,126 per ounce the year before. In silver, despite having record production in 2016, the timing of shipments and related revenue recognition resulted in a 6% decline in total sales of silver in concentrate to 19 million ounces; more than offsetting the lower volumes was a 16% increase in the average realized silver price to 1,757 per ounce.	The Company’s concentrated revenue and trade receivables included provisionally priced metal sales which are mark-to-market each period. Provisionally priced metal at the end of 2016 included 3.3 million silver ounces, 1,800 gold ounces at $1,595 and $1,151 per ounce respectively. It also included 2,100 tons of lead and 2,500 tons of zinc priced at $1,983 and $2,619 per ton respectively. Given the rising prices we’ve already seen this quarter, we anticipate seeing a positive adjustment in our Q1 results as we close the quotational period on those sales and lock-in price period in Q1.	Turning to the cost side of the P&L. With higher gold production and sales volumes, both production costs and depreciation expenses increased from 2015. The depreciation expense also included a few adjustments related to the finalization of the purchase price allocation for the acquisitions, valuation and useful lives of the underlying assets. You can see this impact in the increase of our cost per ounce gold metrics which increased from $753 in 2015 for La Arena only to $816 for the gold division in 2016 which includes all the operations.	On a per ounce cost basis, as you heard, we had strong performance from our operations. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining cost for silver were $5.84 and $8.06 per ounce respectively. These are our best ever and were at the low end of our guidance. Contributing to the improvements in these costs was ongoing optimization efforts at Escobal as well as the low metal prices in Q1 that resulted in sales that finalized below the $16 an ounce threshold for the payments of the voluntary royalty in Guatemala.	Gold per ounce costs were well below guidance. Total cash cost per ounce of gold averaged $620 versus our guidance of $675 to $725 per ounce. These low costs also reflect the effort of the operations in cost containment. All-in sustaining costs were $943 per ounce versus guidance of $950 to a $1,000 per ounce. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs were higher than in 2015 with our only gold producing mine was the open pit at La Arena.	Exploration expenses in 2016 of $14 million were double the 2015 level and reflect our efforts to grow production in our newest jurisdictions. As you can see from the guidance, this trend is continuing in 2017. Corporate G&A costs were $48 million compared to $39 million in 2015 with the increase primarily due to transaction costs related to the acquisition of Lake Shore, a full year of operations in Peru and nine months in Canada.	Now, turning to the fourth quarter, I am going to talk about results in relation to the previous quarter, given that both periods include Lake Shore Gold assets and Shahuindo in commercial production.	Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital for Q4 totaled $75 million or $0.24 per share, which compared to a $126 million or $0.40 per share for the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings were $18 million or $0.06 per share compared to $66 million or $0.21 per share in Q3.	We reported earnings of just over $300,000 or just under a penny per share in Q4 compared to earnings of $63 million or $0.20 per share in Q3. The difference between the adjusted earnings and the earnings in Q4 2016 was primarily the result of a non-cash non-recurring deferred tax charge resulting from a change in tax rate in Peru. The revised corporate income tax rate has moved from a declining rate, which was expected to culminate in 26% in 2019 to a flat rate of 29.5% effective January 1, 2017. The declining rate regime was used in the valuation of Rio Alto in April 2015. As a result of the rate change, the deferred tax liability associated with the acquisition was revalued using the 29.5% rate, and the difference was taken through the deferred tax expense line.	However, the largest single factor contributing to lower cash flow and adjusted earnings in Q4 was $45.3 million or a 19% reduction in revenue to a $189 million. Both gold and silver sales declined from the prior quarter. However, the greatest impact on revenue was from declining metal prices. Our average realized price for silver and concentrate declined by over $6 per ounce or 30% from the previous quarter to $14.45. The average realized gold price in doré was 9% lower at $1,197 per ounce.	Looking at the silver price in more detail. The average realized price of $14.45 per ounce in Q4 was $2.74 or 16% lower than the average spot price. This discount in spot was the result of negative mark-to-market adjustments on both provisionally priced silver ounces as well as finalized sales during the quarter.	The LME spot price per ounce of silver fell from $19.18 at the beginning of the quarter to $16.24 on the last day of the year. As we have indicated, there has been a more favorable churn in metal prices so far in 2017.	Production costs were largely unchanged from Q3, while higher depreciation expense reflected the impact of adjustments made as we finalized the purchase price and adjusted our depreciation model. We also had small increases in exploration and G&A spending in Q4, 2016. On a per ounce cost basis, our total silver cash costs were $6.48 while all-in sustaining costs averaged $9.76 per ounce in the quarter. In Q3 2016, these costs were $6.50 and $8.68 per ounce respectively. The increase in all-in sustaining costs reflected the timing of ongoing mine development at Escobal.	We had a strong per ounce cost performance on the gold side of our business in Q4. Total cash cost averaged $594 per ounce, the lowest quarterly average of the year. All-in sustaining costs were $945 per ounce of gold produced, and these costs compared to $6.25 and $9.74 per ounce respectively in the third quarter.	Finally, Tahoe ended 2016 in a very strong financial position. Our cash and cash equivalent at December 31st was a $163 million; we had debt and leases of approximately $50 million, which left us with over $110 million of net cash at year-end. We also remain undrawn on our $150 million credit facility and un-hedged on all our metals, so we can take advantage of the rising price environment. As outlined in our guidance, 2017 is the peak year for capital expenditures as we work towards achieving our growth objectives. With our strong financial, we are confident in our ability to finance our growth while maintaining our industry-leading dividend.	With that, I’ll now turn the call back to Ron.	Ron Clayton	Thanks, Liz.	As I mentioned earlier, we released new three year guidance with our results yesterday and we also provided more detailed breakout of our 2017 costs.	Our guidance anticipates that over the next three years, production will ramp up to at least a 0.5 million ounces in 2019 with heading to our target of 550 by 2020, with low capital requirements and low operating costs. It also shows that the increase in production is expected to be begin in the second half of next year. Our two key projects, expanding Shahuindo to 36,000 tons per day, and deepening Bell Creek shaft are both scheduled to be completed by the middle of the year in 2018, with commissioning to take place in the second half of the year.	Our gold production is targeted at between 375,000 and 425,000 ounces this year, and production is estimated to increase to between 425,000 and 500,000 ounces in 2018. We’re targeting between 0.5 million and 550,000 in 2019. With the completion of our two key projects, we’re forecasting lower capital expenditures. Capital is expected to peak this year with sustaining capital between $160 million and $175 million and project capital to $150 million to $175 million. By 2019, sustaining capital expenditures are projected to be down to $100 million to $125 million, which is essentially what we did in 2016, while project capital expenditures should be below $10 million. Of course, that assumes we’re not building any new projects, which I hope we are with our exploration success.	At the same time that capital expenditures are declining, we expect to see a coincident sharp improvement in our cost performance. In particular, all-in sustaining costs for gold production are forecast to improve from our guidance of $1,150 to $1,250 this year to range of $900 to $1,000 per ounce in 2019, again basically back in line with our 2016 levels.	Before I delve into the gold assets in more detail, I’d like to touch on Escobal. Over the next three years, production is forecast to be between 18 million and 21 million ounces, and essentially are 20 million ounces a year that we’ve been doing since we opened the mine three years ago. With cash cost between $7 and $8.50 and all-in sustaining costs between $9.50 and $11, it’s virtually the same guidance we’ve had over the last three years, and we anticipate at least through 2021.	Turning to gold, as outlined in the technical report at La Arena. La Arena production is scheduled to come down to around 150,000 ounces in 2017. In fact, we expect to be in that range for the next four years with total cash costs averaging between $750 and $800 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce. The remaining mine life at La Arena is four years with there being a couple of years of residual leaching after that. Sustaining capital expenditures are targeted at $26 million to $28 million this year and should decline to a few million dollars in 2019.	Having said that, we now believe, there may be a whole new chapter to the life of La Arena. We just finished an internal scoping study of the La Arena Phase 2 copper-gold project. While the study is not 43-101 complaint, I can tell you that based on our conclusions, we’re now very excited about this project. The numbers are -- we are getting are much larger and much better than those published in the 2014 technical report. We’ve now hired in three engineers to do 43-101 PEA for this project. We expect it to be done in September, in time for an analyst and investor day that we’re planning on for September 14th, stay tuned.	Turning to Shahuindo. I’m happy to say that we have now received the construction permit for our first crushing and agglomeration circuit. We already have the environmental permits for the full 36,000 ton per day operation, so we’re underway with the construction now. We’ve also largely completed an optimization review at Shahuindo. Results to-date support the achievement of throughput and recovery rates for agglomerated ores contained in the January 2016 technical report. The review’s also identified opportunities to slightly reduce capital and operating costs at the mine through revisions to the crushing and agglomeration circuit, essentially we’re going to go to single-stage crushing.	Our work shows that the ultimate recovery could actually exceed the 80% envisioned in the study, the technical study. And that conclusion is based on multiple sets of test work performed over several years. In 2017, production at Shahuindo is targeted at 65,000 to 85,000 ounces. We expect to have the first crushing and agglomeration circuit on line early in the fall, so the production expected to somewhat weighted to the second half of the year.	We often get asked why our all-in sustaining costs for gold are going up in 2017. The answer is, the low cost ounces from La Arena are being replaced with high cost ounces from Shahuindo, which remains very much a ramp-up development story with higher than what we expect, over the average of the mine life, for sustaining capital with accelerated leach pads and waste dumps. We’re estimating all-in sustaining costs of Shahuindo in 2017 of $1,600 to $1,700 per ounce. When the mine reaches 36,000 tons per day in the second half of next year, all-in sustaining costs should be well-below the $1,000 per ounce level.	Sustaining capital at Shahuindo is targeted to be between $50 million and $55 million in 2017, which brings total sustaining capital in Peru to around $80 million for the year. By the time, we reached 2019, we expect sustaining capital for all of Peru, Shahuindo and La Arena together to total around $35 million annually. Project capital expenditures of Shahuindo in 2017 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million, largely related to the crushing and agglomeration circuit. By late next year, project capital should be almost nothing.	Turning to Timmins. We’re targeting 165,000 to 185,000 ounces of production in 2017 at cash cost between $650 and $700 an ounce and all-in sustaining cost between $1,000 and $1,100 per ounce. Sustaining capital expenditures are estimated at $50 million to $55 million which we regard as the normal run rate for our Canadian operations.	Project capital this year is targeted at around $75 million, largely for the Bell Creek shaft project. With completion of that project in the middle of next year, our project capital will go to near zero, assuming no new initiatives are undertaken. And our all-in sustaining costs are expected to be between $900 and $1,000 per ounce.	Finally, as part of our year-end results, we released our annual update to mineral reserves and resources. For the most part, we saw results consistent with the prior estimates last 2016 depletion. We did lower the assumed price at Escobal to $20 per ounce, which increased the average grade and took some ounces out. In Timmins, the reserve at Timmins West came down. However, we expect a very substantial increase in reserves at Timmins West Mine when we release the initial reserve for 144 Gap.	One of the things I want to remind everybody is that our typical procedure is to do our major reserve resource update in the second quarter and release that information in the third quarter; we do this because it gives us a better base for our long-term budgeting and life of mine planning, which takes place in the third quarter of the year.	Most importantly, we’re very excited about the potential to grow resources and reserves, both at Shahuindo and in Canada, based on the results of our 2016 exploration program. As we announced in January, our drilling last year identified a number of near-pit oxide zones at Shahuindo in support of future pit expansion. We also identified a number of large district targets through trenching and channel sampling that we could -- that could represent a whole new component to the Shahuindo operation. We’ll be drilling at these targets this year as permits are received. They could add both mine life and substantial new production.	In Canada, we succeeded in extending mineralization virtually everywhere we drill, particularly encouraging was the depth extension we achieved at Timmins West Mine and the extensions of the NA/NA2 zones along strike at Bell Creek. We also had some very encouraging results at Vogel to the east of Bell Creek along the trend toward Goldcorp’s Hoyle Pond mine. We plan to drill on all these areas in 2017 with the goal of bringing extensions at Timmins West and Bell Creek into resources and ultimately into reserves. Our guidance for exploration in 2017 is 30 million to 35 million. It’s a very extensive and aggressive program. We plan to update the market on our progress throughout the year.	With that operator, I think we’re ready to take questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Cosmos Chiu with CIBC. Please go ahead.	Cosmos Chiu	Thanks, Ron and team. Just a few questions from me, maybe first off on the Shahuindo in Peru. I’m still a bit unclear here in terms of what’s happening with the crush and agglomerator, but, Ron, if you can confirm for me. So, now are you fully committed to the 36,000 ton per day crush and agglomerator?	Ron Clayton	Cosmos, you should expect us to achieve all of the things that are outlined in that technical report that we put out in early 2016. Yes, we’re a 100% committed to crushing and agglomeration; it’s virtually a 100% of the ore. We’re going to scalp off a very small percentage of larger material that we’ll agglomerate. But it’s fairly insignificant for your purposes. It does nice things for us in terms of geotechnical stability on the pads. But yes, we’re going to do 36,000 tons a day; we’re going to see at least 80% recovery from that. We’re very satisfied that we’re on the right track, so there should be no doubt in anybody’s mind that we’re not going to be able to achieve -- we will achieve the KPIs basically that are in the technical report.	Cosmos Chiu	Great. And then, Ron, on that in terms of timing, you mentioned that the first crusher agglomerator is going to be completed later on in 2017 to 12,000 tons per day. So, when should we expect the “expansion” to 36,000 tons per day? When is the additional 24,000 tons per day going to get built?	Ron Clayton	It’s exactly like the scheduling that feasibility study. It will be up and running by the middle of 2018 next year. And we’ll have that -- second half of the year will be the commissioning period, and you’ll see a ramp up in production and recoveries in the whole nine yards in the second half of 2018. You should expect Shahuindo to produce about 200,000 ounces, give or take, in 2019.	Cosmos Chiu	Okay. And then, in terms of the permit, and I know -- in terms of construction permit, Ron, you mentioned that right now you have the construction permit for the first phase or the first plant. Do you need an additional permit, construction permit for the second part, and when would you expect that to come in?	Ron Clayton	Yes, we do. And we need to have it roughly by the end of the year or very early next year. Let me explain something about permitting in Peru.	Cosmos Chiu	Okay.	Ron Clayton	Particularly -- once you get the environmental license, which is the big one that we’ve got for Shahuindo, it’s kind of like building a house. You do your design work and then you get a permit to construct, and then you do the construction and then you have an inspection, and then you get your license to operate the thing, which is like getting an occupancy license to move into your house, okay? So, there is always, when you’re in a construction phase, there is always little permitting things that have to happen but the big one is get an EIA done or EIS done, and getting that environmental permit. And then these orders come pretty naturally, okay?	Cosmos Chiu	So, you foresee no issues in terms of construction permits?	Ron Clayton	No. And the only issue that we’ve run it into all in Peru is things seem to take a little bit longer than they should. And it’s not complications; it’s probably not enough resources in the agencies.	Cosmos Chiu	And then, on that and as you mentioned, the 24,000 tons per day expansion as per the feasibility study will get built sometime in 2018. Looking your 2018 CapEx budget, $50 million to about $70 million for the whole Company. So, is it safe to assume that a big portion of that is going to be allocated to Shahuindo in Peru? That’s the development CapEx.	Ron Clayton	Yes. Liz? Do you want to add some comment, Eliz?	Elizabeth McGregor	Yes. I’m just taking a look.	Cosmos Chiu	Hi, Liz.	Elizabeth McGregor	Hi. Yes. That’s a fair assumption. The shaft project is pretty much complete by 2018, and our project capital in 2018 is really finishing up those two projects. So, the majority will be Peru.	Ron Clayton	Yes. And to put a little capital on that Cosmos, most of that equipment will get purchased this year. We’ll put some purchase orders out to that Phase 2 gear here fairly soon, probably in the next quarter or so.	Cosmos Chiu	Great. And then, maybe switching gears a little bit, in terms of Timmins West. Ron, you mentioned about the reserve, resource update. What caught my eye was the decreasing grade at Timmins West. I believe reserve grades went from 4.2 gram per ton to the 3.69. You did mentioned that and I expect the reserve to eventually increase once again, as you get 144 Gap into it. But I believe 144 Gap is also not higher grade. So, how should we look at grade at Timmins West and how should we model the head grade at Timmins West on a go forward basis?	Ron Clayton	Yes. I’m a little bit disappointed in that grade decrease. And I think there is few things that we can do, as we look at our mine plans and modeling. I’m expecting the Timmins West operations like the whole Timmins side of that -- yes, that whole side of the operation to be roughly a 4 gram to a 4.2 gram kind of deposit, like it’s always been.	Operator	The next question is from Michael Gray with Macquarie. Please go ahead.	Ron Clayton	Good morning, Michael.	Michael Gray	Hey. Good morning, Ron. Can you hear me fine?	Ron Clayton	Yes, we can.	Michael Gray	Okay. In terms of the 2019 gold production guidance and the indication of 550,000 ounces plus in 2020. Does this include a mill expansion at the Bell Creek, no?	Ron Clayton	We don’t need -- we do not need a mill expansion to achieve those numbers. So, no, it doesn’t.	Michael Gray	Okay. Thank you. And on the 30 million to 40 million of exploration planned in each of 2018 and 2019. Are you able to give us a bit of a split where that will go?	Ron Clayton	I’ll give you some rough numbers here. It’s roughly 18 million in Peru, about 17 million in Canada and a couple in…	Elizabeth McGregor	18?	Ron Clayton	Well, that’s for 2017, Michael. Yes, for 2018, Brian, go ahead.	Brian Brodsky	Yes. Hi, Mike. So, this year, what we’ve got budgeted is about 24 million in Canada, 15 million in Peru and about a 1 million in Guatemala.	Ron Clayton	What about -- and 2018 probably won’t look much different than that.	Michael Gray	Okay. That’s helpful. And final question, on the block model reinterpretation at Timmins West and Bell Creek, could we get any more color on what the major changes were in terms of the resource estimation method?	Ron Clayton	Yes. Charlie, why don’t you deal with that?	Charlie Muerhoff	Sure. Yes, it’s really -- the change in the resource was just due to drilling, some infill drilling in some areas along the margins of the deposits. That basically shows that the prior models is just extended ore grade mineralization a little bit too far. So it’s really just some refinement of the model in those areas.	Michael Gray	Okay. So, refinement on the shapes more though so than the...	Charlie Muerhoff	Yes. It’s not an estimation modeling thing, it’s just more of refinement of the boundary.	Ron Clayton	And Michael, I’m not sure we’re going to have enough drilling down deep at Timmins West by September to upgrade the reserve and resource. Certainly, if we have enough done, we will. But you’re going to see a nice increase below the mine at good grade.	Operator	The next question is from Mike Parkin with Desjardins. Please go ahead.	Mike Parkin	Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you speak to the realized silver price that you have in the report of 14.45. That’s below the spot price over the last most of the year. Can you, what’s -- how is that report, is that net of like TCRCs or how do you get to that point?	Ron Clayton	No, it isn’t. And I’m going to let Liz give you a little more detail here. But to start with, the basic calculation is you take the revenue from the sales and subtract, and basically, we subtract the change in the mark-to-market and divide it by the sales ounces. So, you’re spreading that mark-to-market decline over the ounces in the quarter. Add any detail, Liz?	Elizabeth McGregor	No. I can’t really add a whole lot more. Basically the adjustments I’ll go through revenue line. And like Ron said, then taking over -- the total revenue, net of those mark-to-market adjustments is taken over the new sales that originated in the quarter. So, we’re not adjusting that denominator in that calculation, to reflect the previous quarter provisionally priced. So, it is a realized price on those sales ounces, but it’s taking into account the adjustment. Had the price gone up, you would have seen it go in the other direction, because the calculation works just the same.	Mike Parkin	Okay.	Ron Clayton	At the end of the day, the only real value of net number is to help you guys track your way through our revenue but -- to help you get through the mark-to-market calculation, okay? Other than that, it doesn’t have much value.	Mike Parkin	Okay. And then on G&A. Should we expect to kind of be weighted similar to 2016 for 2017 in terms of the capital?	Ron Clayton	No.	Elizabeth McGregor	G&A is generally relatively evenly spread out quarter-over-quarter, unless there is a unusual transaction. So for 2017, we would expect our G&A to be relatively straight over each quarter.	Mike Parkin	Okay. And then in terms of depreciation, if we look at the appreciation per ounce, per asset that we use going forward. Should that be fairly fair?	Elizabeth McGregor	Yes. It actually is going to go up with the new resource adjustments and then some finalizations that were made at the end of the year. The silver is very steady; there is going to be no change there. And then, on the gold, we were about $200 an ounce on the gold this year, and I expect that to go up to about $300 for 2017.	Mike Parkin	Okay. Do you have a number for silver?	Elizabeth McGregor	I do. On a per ton basis, it’s about $30; on a per ounce basis, it’s about $3.	Mike Parkin	Your comments there about the drop in grade at Timmins West and you’re expecting it to -- are you expecting the whole aggregate camp to come at 4.2? What’s going to -- how do you feel -- is that a function of the exploration upside, you see a depth to bring that into reserves?	Ron Clayton	Yes. The Timmins West mine itself, I think at depth stuff will offset what we saw along the margins with this drilling this year. In general, as we look forward and because I am not the reserve resource guy, but you know my anticipation is that these mines are going to run pretty similar grade to what they have in the recent history. So, the Timmins West part of the complex, so Timmins West under Creek 144s generally run between 4 to 4.2 grams. And I don’t see any reason for that to change over the next 10 years of production that we know about; and Bell Creek tends to run just a little bit higher than that. I wouldn’t expect it to change much.	Operator	The next question is from Steven Butler with GMP Securities. Please go ahead.	Steven Butler	So, a question for you guys on Escobal PDAC, [ph] Liz, did you guys make any voluntary royalty payments at Escobal in the fourth quarter, given the realized price was 14.45 or was there some portion of voluntary payments made in the quarter?	Elizabeth McGregor	So, we actually are -- the pricing on those new sales was 15.95 at the end of the quarter. And we actually made a determination to accrue that royalty given where prices were going in Q1. So, we did book the royalty in the fourth quarter.	Ron Clayton	And Steve, I want to make sure you understand something. That realized price has nothing to do with anything other than the mark-to-market calculation and the sales in the quarter. It doesn’t get used for royalty, it doesn’t get used for anything. It’s the spot price or the forward curve that determines the royalty or the financials or that kind of thing.	Steven Butler	Okay. That’s good. But, you did accrue some of this, as you said, Liz, that’s good. Escobal, what fuel price assumption is included in your 2017 guidance? Where our spot price is today for diesel or for Brent or crude or maybe your diesel would you quote us? And what is the sensitivity to you operating cost for a 10% change in fuel price and maybe you can get back to me or…	Ron Clayton	In the guidance, right? It’s in the guidance notes in the release, that sensitivity is.	Elizabeth McGregor	Yes. So, we averaged about $2 and a 10% change in diesel prices, $0.10 on silver and $7 on gold.	Ron Clayton	And our guidance is a little higher than that. Our guidance, going forward, we tend to look at a little bit higher. Diesel prices and a little bit higher labor cost than we’ve experienced just because those tend to be our bigger inputs. And so, it makes the guidance a bit conservative if you don’t see changes in those things.	Elizabeth McGregor	We did include a sensitivity table feed in the MD&A, and I believe in the press release on commodity prices as well as currency. So, you can see the impact of those.	Steven Butler	So, your actual -- there you go, 2017 guidance, $2 a gallon. And what is the spot price; is it materially lower than that or is it not far from that level?	Elizabeth McGregor	I don’t think it’s too much farther than that…	Ron Clayton	Yes, it’s a little lower than that but not a lot.	Elizabeth McGregor	You do also have to remember that in each of these jurisdictions, there is going to be different transport assumptions that have been built in there and different tax assumptions in the different regions. So, on average, we are at about $2 a gallon across the Company.	Steven Butler	Ron and Charlie, it’s a long way to get to 4 grams or 4.1 or 4.2 grams at Timmins West rig based on your current reserve number and your inferred or indicated resource grades at 144. So, that’s I think the market is concerned today. And that’s just more of a comment I guess for you. But, I am not sure whether or not there is additional dilution amounts that you factor into your reserve recalculation, maybe you can elaborate a bit more. Charlie.	Ron Clayton	Yes. I think that’s part of it Steve but most of it was as Charlie said that it’s drilling on the margin with lower grade.	Charlie Muerhoff	Yes. There were some calculations and the mine plan is constructed on the resource model. Those procedures really haven’t changed from last year.	Ron Clayton	And Steve, my previous comments about that if that really is real when we get there to mine it, what’s going to happen is we’re going to replace that with higher grade production down deeper in mine.	Operator	The next question is from Chris Thompson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.	Chris Thompson	Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have actually been answered, but I just want to hone in on a couple of things. I did notice obviously that you sold less gold ounces and produced in the fourth quarter. Do you expect a reversal of this first quarter?	Ron Clayton	Yes. Yes, that was just timing of sales.	Chris Thompson	All right. Would you classify that as a little abnormal on a quarterly basis, because it was…	Ron Clayton	Yes, probably a little bit on the gold side and silver too. One of the things that happens, we had a lot of silver that was on the water, but not sold yet. And some of that was related to where it was going and some of it was related to a little more production at the backend of the quarter than the front-end of the quarter. Some of our -- particularly our concentrate is the bigger impactor here on the difference between sales and production. And some of our concentrate settlements occur at their port rather than at our port. So, if we’re happening to go to those two customers, then we’ve got some time on the water where we’ve got production that hasn’t been sold yet.	Chris Thompson	Okay, great. Thanks for that, Ron. Just finally also, you mentioned Shahuindo, I guess would be looking at about maybe 200,000 ounces production 2019. Do you see that sort of study state, is that your plan?	Ron Clayton	The average over the ten-plus-year mine life is going to be 170,000 ounces. So, that’s typical of a new orebody and what we’ve done with Shahuindo, we kind of started the mine on the higher grade section of the mine and then we’ll get into more average grades as it goes out.	Chris Thompson	Okay. And then, just can you give us a sense -- obviously, you present the growth as far as on the gold, as far as the total I guess for the operations. But, what are you looking for, for Timmins and La Arena for the next couple of years?	Ron Clayton	Well, to get to that 550, the target roughly is 300,000 ounces a year out of Peru and 250,000 out of Timmins. But that mix is going to kind of change around a little bit, depending on what we’re -- what we’re seeing going forward. So, for example, if our exploration success turns out to something fairly sizable at Shahuindo, you could actually see Peru come up a little bit above that. I’m thinking a couple of years out. So, I’m not sure I answered your question, but roughly, we’re looking for 180,000 ounces jumping up to around 200,000 to 220,000 out of Timmins, once Bell Creek is up and running and we’re looking for 300,000 ounces out of Peru between Shahuindo and La Arena over the next four years. And then, we’ll bring in probably the Whitney pit to jump us up for that 550. And we don’t actually need that, because of the Shahuindo is going to go up over the 200,000 -- or go up to the 200,000 for a while.	Chris Thompson	Okay. I guess it introduces my final question. You just mentioned the Whitney pit there. Can you give us a sense of where we stand as far consolidated net ownership?	Ron Clayton	I missed the last part for your question, Chris.	Chris Thompson	Sorry, I’m questioning what will it take I guess by way of ownership on the Whitney pit for Tahoe to obviously…	Ron Clayton	Yes. That JV is roughly of the 70-30 split. Goldcorp has indicated that they aren’t going to be participate -- okay, it’s about 80% now. Liz is just flashing me a number here. So, it’s 80-20 right now. Goldcorp basically indicated that they don’t plan to participate. So, I think over time if we don’t do something different, they will dilute out by the time we get into production with that.	Operator	Next question is from Geordie Mark with Haywood Securities. Please go ahead.	Geordie Mark	Yes. Good morning. Just a follow-on from a range of questions. And I’d just add to those maybe on Shahuindo and then rollout with La Arena. If you could take me through the water management and plan, I guess going forward for Shahuindo as you ramp up from 10,000 tons a day to 12,000 and then up through the ramp up on next year’s 36,000 tons per day. Just, where you’re at maybe and what the plan is to build up your required water balance there?	Ron Clayton	Going [indiscernible] it’s that simple. We’re in progress.	Geordie Mark	Okay. And on the La Arena, ultimately, if you could help us out with maybe some modeling there. On the reserves, are you expecting further conversion of other resources or bringing other resources into the reserve to bring out the life of mine plus 2020 or 2021? What you’re thinking out there?	Ron Clayton	No. We’ve got four years of production in the La Arena oxide at roughly 150,000 ounces a year and then there will be residual leaching. And that’s it.	Geordie Mark	Okay. And we should just assume…	Ron Clayton	Then, we’re going to have La Arena sulfide project coming up.	Geordie Mark	Great. That’s good. And we should assume to see the average head grade and the existing sort of recovery balance at the moment going forward in that?	Ron Clayton	I don’t see much change in La Arena.	Operator	The next question is from Matthew O’Keefe with Echelon Wealth Partners. Please go ahead.	Matthew O’Keefe	Good. So, just a couple of questions back on Escobal. First up, costs, you have them in your forecasts. Thank you for the three-year forecast by the way. But you have them creeping up a bit here to 750 to 850. Just curious, what are the main drivers of that increase and then of them -- what are the major swing factors that you might -- we might want to watch out for at Escobal?	Ron Clayton	I’m going to let Liz to talk about that. But before that I’m going to just hit a couple of things. One is, the guidance isn’t much different. It’s actually almost identical to what we put out for 2016 and the big difference in 2016 was that silver price was below 16 bucks in the first quarter, and we didn’t pay voluntary royalties. So, you saw across the year as the royalties came up or price came back more in line with that original guidance. Just as a general statement, Matt, with our guidance, we try to tend to under promise and over deliver a little bit. So, I generally would tell you across the Board our guidance is a little conservative. Now, I’m going to let Liz jump in and give you some detail.	Elizabeth McGregor	And I agree that the two biggest factors that we have in the Escobal costs are really that royalty that is dependent on the silver price and that dependence is based on where the sales finally settle. So, the mark-to-market, while it doesn’t impact it kind of month-over-month, the adjustment, if a sale settles below $16 regardless of the price it originated at, we’re going to see movements in the royalty there. And that can get a little, Matthew, is not the right word, but it can get a little bit difficult to model, if you have swings in your silver price that is going up and down about 16.	Ron Clayton	Right around that line.	Elizabeth McGregor	Right around that line, it gets a little bit complicated. And then, the other large impact is the diesel, which is why we put the sensitivity in there. We have made the assumption that we run on diesel generated power, because that’s what we’re using right now. And if the diesel prices up significantly in one direction or the other, we do see a swing in our cash costs.	Matthew O’Keefe	Okay. Got you. And that provisional pricing that we’re talking about. So, maybe just help us a bit, I mean for a sense of this. So, if you, like a ton of concentrate, what’s the difference in timing between the pricing of the concentrate and when you actually recognize that adjustment? I mean, is it like a month or three months that could pass before -- between those two numbers?	Elizabeth McGregor	So, for accounting purposes, it’s actually mark-to-market every month. And then what happens is the quotational period is generally three months out. And so, when you initiate the sale, like let’s say you initiated in August, the goal -- you’re going to have the quotational period locked down by the end of the year. But you may not actually settle that final sale until January of the following year, just due to asset exchanges and settlements. So, you can actually have sales that kind of run through your numbers from a revenue perspective and a royalty perspective that’s hitting you across three quarters. But generally, the period is three to four months, we want to see sale originate and get locked down in that period.	Ron Clayton	Matt, most of our quotational periods in our concentrate contracts are what’s called two momma and that’s two months after the month of arrival. Generally, you should assume from the time we produce it until the time it gets through that quotational period is going to be three or slightly more months.	Matthew O’Keefe	Great, okay. Okay, no, that’s great. And then, I guess just one final thing, maybe you could just talk a little bit about. I get this question a lot is on the dividend stability. Obviously we can -- I mean, we’ve talked about having Escobal as a great underpinning of your -- cash flows from Escobal is great, would underpin that dividend. But, I mean, given your balance sheet now looks pretty good and with your current cash flow, all is there to support your current growth plan, but what kind of sensitivity have you looked at as far as a rapid change in the silver price or something as far as protecting the dividend? Is it sacrosanct or is it on the table, should things turn against us?	Ron Clayton	Let me just broadly make some statements about philosophical conversation. And obviously, this is a Board vision in terms of the dividend. But when we look at the dividend, for example, if the silver price dropped to 15 and gold was under 1,000 for a significant period of time, we would start looking at what is discretionary in our budgets. We know that, we know what those things are. And so, I’d tell you, in 2017, there is somewhere between 20 and $40 million of exploration and capital discretionary projects that would not hurt our ramp-up and in growth to the delay. And I think we would see those as more discretionary than the dividend.	But, if we got to the point where we’re looking at long-term substantially lower prices, certainly at some point, the dividend becomes a conversation. But, I’m also going to tell you, on the other side of the coin, and we’ve always said this, this is not a change in philosophy at all. If we found something that we could do and we may have these internal projects that might fit this bill at some point, if we can take a dollar of shareholder value and turn it into five with say the sell side project, then, we’re going to do that and you would rather, we did that and use the dividend to do that for a period of time. So, it swings both ways, Matt.	Operator	The next question is from Howard Flinker with Flinker and Company. Please go ahead.	Howard Flinker	Hello, Liz. Hello, Kevin, if you’re listening. I have two minor questions. One, if I want to adjust informally your earnings for the cost of converting the bond and the FX, should the tax rate be at 29% or something different?	Ron Clayton	I’m going to pass that to Liz. She is thinking.	Elizabeth McGregor	I am thinking. Can I get back to you on that one?	Howard Flinker	Yes, certainly, anyway. I was just trying to do this informally. Second, you mentioned mark-to-market in adjusting revenue for per ounce. Mark-to-market, what are you marking to market?	Ron Clayton	Okay. So, every month when we ship concentrate out the door, depending on the contract, we get it provisionally priced. So, we get a provisional payment from the smelter, either shortly after it goes on the ship or it may be out when it arrives at the other place. But we get a price -- a provisional settlement that’s based on the average month price for that month. But the final settlement doesn’t happen until the quotational period is over. So, every month, everything that hasn’t been finally settled but has been provisionally priced, we market to the market price.	Howard Flinker	Sure. You’re shipping generally on Monday and then you deliver 21 days later and then there is a difference. So, you mark that to market is what I understood.	Ron Clayton	Correct. Yes, all the way up to the final settlement and then we book the final settlement. So, you book in the differences.	Howard Flinker	So, that’s what you’re marking?	Ron Clayton	Yes.	Howard Flinker	And this probably won’t apply to me, but just out of curiosity, will your analytical day be in Nevada or Colorado, because its right around the time of those two conferences?	Ron Clayton	Actually it’s going to be in Toronto between the two but we’ll webcast it. So, you can see it from wherever you are.	Howard Flinker	Okay. I’m going to stay in Colorado between the two of that.	Ron Clayton	Okay.	Howard Flinker	All right. Thanks, guys.	Ron Clayton	Yes.	Operator	The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.	Ron Clayton	Good morning, John.	John Tumazos	Good morning. Thank you for your net cash position and you generous dividends and all your hard work for seven years.	Ron Clayton	Hopefully, we’re going to continue to do that. I think we’ve got the plan in place to make that happen and maybe even make it better.	John Tumazos	First question, the market isn’t recognizing your had work. Would sell one of your three divisions or a project and buy back stock, since the market seems to be…	Ron Clayton	Yes. I don’t think that’s in the cards John, because I think we believe very strongly, we can create a whole a lot more value by developing those projects. So, I don’t queue that.	John Tumazos	Could you please quantify the rate of return at different gold and silver prices at some of your larger projects? The market seems to be mistreating you as those, some of your projects are at mining pit and doesn’t understand the rate of returns.	Ron Clayton	Yes. I can’t do that on this phone call; that’s an enormous thing that you just asked me to do, but we can do it and get it back to you. And I’ll take that under advisement, maybe we need to put that information out.	John Tumazos	I’m worried for you. And I’m just…	Ron Clayton	I know. We think it’s tremendous, John.	John Tumazos	Thank you.	Ron Clayton	Yes.	Operator	The next question is from Stephen Walker with RBC. Please go ahead.	Ron Clayton	Good morning, Stephen.	Stephen Walker	Good morning, Ron. Just, can you help me get a better sense on your preparedness for the expansion at Shahuindo? Can you give us a percentage of the detailed technical drawings that you have in hand for the 12,000 and the 36,000 rate and…	Ron Clayton	For Phase 1, we have -- I’m sorry, finish. I’m sorry, Steve.	Stephen Walker	I’m sorry. And any contracts for the 36,000 and where do you stand on that?	Ron Clayton	Yes. So, the 12,000 ton a day, we’re building that; the drawings are done. I mean, we actually started building some of the stuff before we got the construction permit because we could assemble things like grasshoppers and things like that. We precast a lot of the concrete. So, we could just move it in, once we got the permit. So, we’re well aligned. I mean, that -- I don’t know but I had a project that by the time we started construction was so far along. And they are fairly simple projects. In terms of the Phase 2, we’ve got a little bit of engineering yet to do but it’s not a lot. And primarily it’s taken out the second stage of crushing out of those drawings. And we’ll have that work all done and be ordering the equipment here fairly quickly. And on the Phase 1 stuff, 75% of that equipment is in the country.	In terms of contracts, we’re doing most of that stuff with -- our OHL, which is the vendor and our dirt work’s getting done by STRACON. [Ph] So, there is not any big contracts there. Roughly, we’ve spent $15 million out of the $80 million total there, and we’ve got $30 million more committed.	Stephen Walker	Perfect. And just one final thing on Shahuindo. The exploration success that you’ve been having, I believe it’s to the north, is that under the existing permitting footprint? Do you have to acquire any lands up through there, is everything…	Ron Clayton	Yes. Nine months ago, we put in a major -- it’s like environmental, yes, semi-detailed environmental, it’s an EIA basically. And we’re expecting to get that permit any day now. And that will allow us to drill a lot of holes.	Stephen Walker	And then, the development or the mining of that and moving materials is again another matter to deal with?	Ron Clayton	Yes. It would be like permitting a new mine with the exception of we probably use the existing plant to try to expand the existing plant. So, you’d have to do that part -- or that part of it would be a little easier.	Operator	This concludes time allocated for questions on today’s call. I will now hand the call back over to Ron Clayton for closing remarks.	Ron Clayton	Thanks for joining us today. And I really appreciate all the great questions. And just to conclude, Tahoe is a company that in 2016 achieved production and cost guidance for the third consecutive year. By the way, we’ve been in production for the three years. So, every year we’ve been in production, we’ve achieved our guidance. We have the pleasure of owning and operating one of the world’s truly great silver mines and Escobal. And we’re also a company that’s well on its way to becoming at least a 0.5 million ounce gold producer over the next three years. And that production level, we expect to have very low cost on a per share basis, on a per ounce basis, low capital requirements. And we think we’re going to be well-positioned to generate a lot of free cash flow.	So with the investment to achieve our growth plans, at the same time, we also continue to pay the industry -- one of the industry’s most attractive dividends. We’ve got a lot of near-term catalysts on the way to support our valuation. And we’re looking forward to updating you on our progress. Thanks for attending the call.	Operator	This concludes today’s conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.

11,El Pollo Loco Holdings (NASDAQ:LOCO),RIO,Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call,"March 9, 2017 17:00 ET","Executives	Steve Sather - President and Chief Executive Officer	Larry Roberts - Chief Financial Officer	Analysts	Jake Bartlett - SunTrust	Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities	David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird	Christopher Carril - Morgan Stanley	Matt Curtis - William Blair	Operator	Good day, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the El Pollo Loco Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded today, March 9, 2017. On this call today, we have Steve Sather, President and Chief Executive Officer of El Pollo Loco and Larry Roberts, Chief Financial Officer.	And I would now like to turn the conference over to Larry Roberts.	Larry Roberts	Thank you, operator and good afternoon. By now, everyone should have access to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings release. If not, it can be found at www.elpolloloco.com in the Investor Relations section.	Before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. We refer all of you to our recent SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. We expect to file our 10-K for 2016 tomorrow and we encourage you to review that document at your earliest convenience.	During today’s call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release.	With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Sather.	Steve Sather	Thanks, Larry and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate your joining us on the call today. Fourth quarter results included revenue growth of 7.2% and pro forma net income of $0.12 per share. System-wide comparable store sales decreased 1.3% during the quarter, including a 60 basis point decrease at company-operated restaurants and a 1.9% decrease at franchise restaurants. In line with what we have heard from many of our peers, comparable store sales growth slowed through the fourth quarter and the softness has persisted this year. The softness is at least partially due to the heavy rains that we have had here in Southern California this winter, the impact of which we estimate to be 1% to 1.5% thus far in the first quarter. But we are not satisfied with these results. We remain committed to enhancing our value equation, which is comprised of great food, excellent service and a warm and inviting atmosphere, all at a good price.	The major focus in 2017 is to clearly communicate our differentiation from other QSR and fast causal concepts as well as to enhance convenience and loyalty. At El Pollo Loco, our differentiation starts with the food and our heritage, more specifically it starts with our authentic, signature flame-grilled, citrus-marinated chicken which is crafted by our talented grill masters in our open kitchen or as I like to call it the theater of chicken. Our grill masters, many of whom who have been with the company for 20 plus years, are the key to producing our differentiated, craveable Mexican-inspired menu, which is why we highlighted one of our best in our recent – most recent ad campaign. Pedro Lopez mastered the art of grilling our signature chicken at our original Alvarado Street location, where he dedicated himself to serving guests for the past 32 years. Stories like Pedro’s are at the heart of our new ad campaign, the Road to Authenticity, created with our new partner Vitro. The creative campaign, which we launched in January, will evolve over time to highlight our differentiated brand story, the work that goes on in preparing our food, the relative healthiness of our offerings and the authentic influence of our hometown, Los Angeles.	Our focus on driving convenience and loyalty began in the fourth quarter as we rolled out our mobile ordering system, providing yet another convenient way for guests to enjoy their favorite El Pollo Loco meals. We partnered with Olo to develop the ordering system, which includes a mobile app. The app features a full array of capabilities, such as customizable ordering the full menu, multiple payment options and flexible pickup time selection. As we previously highlighted, the app is the foundation for further technology innovation that we will drive convenience and loyalty. Working with Olo, we expect to begin testing third-party delivery during the first quarter with a rollout currently planned for the second quarter. In addition, we are working with Punchh on a loyalty program, which is expected to launch in the second quarter. We believe that our technology innovations will continue to augment convenience and loyalty for our customers thus driving sales and enhancing our value proposition.	On a more tactical level, we are very focused on addressing the decline in our family meal business that we experienced throughout 2016. Our analysis indicates that for many of our customers a non-price pointed 3-course family meal is not a compelling value offering. In response, we are developing a number of promotions that will deliver great value to our customers while maintaining or even improving margins. The first of these, the $20 family choice meal was promoted in January and was very successful in increasing our family meal mix. This gives us added confidence that we can continue to design promotions that deliver compelling value at attractive food costs.	Turning now to development, during the fourth quarter, we opened 8 new company-operated restaurants. Additionally, franchisees opened 7 new restaurants. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we have opened an additional 5 company restaurants and franchisees have opened 3 more restaurants. We currently expect to open 15 to 20 new company-operated restaurants this year and 8 to 12 new franchise restaurants. We are now using our new development model and are excited about the enhanced analytical capability it provides to identify great sites for new company and franchise restaurants. On the franchise side, we continue to seek high-quality franchisees to develop both existing and new markets.	As we have discussed, our restaurants in the Houston market are underperforming relative to our expectations. Last December, we began a test, which we implemented a number of marketing and operational initiatives at three restaurants. These initiatives were designed to communicate our concept, create a connection with consumers and build awareness by driving trial and repeat visits. While it’s still very early and sales at these restaurants remain below targeted levels, we have seen recent sales improvement and have started to implement the more successful tactics at our other restaurants in Houston. In addition, we have partnered with Ipsos to perform additional customer research in the Houston market. Recommendations from this research will help us better focus our efforts and attract customers and drive sales.	Just as important as our marketing efforts is our focus on continuing to improve our operations. To this end, we’ve recently relocated several of our best operators to Texas. This will ensure that customers receive great food and service when they visit our restaurants, which is critical to driving frequency and word-of-mouth advertising. Our newest market, Dallas, now has 10 restaurants in operation, including 3 franchise restaurants. While it’s still early, the results are essentially in line with expectations. Together with our franchise partner, we expect to open an additional 4 to 6 restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area this year.	Lastly, I’d like to touch on our Vision prototype, which we feel better showcases our authentic brand identity in QSR+ positioning and enhances the environment part of our value equation. All 10 of our Dallas-Fort Worth locations have opened with a new design, and we have completed 4 remodels in California. Feedback has been very favorable, and we’ll continue to closely monitor the reception of the design along with the associated sales lift.	We currently have plans for 4 more remodels in California during the first half of the year and additional 7 by the end of the year, including several in Las Vegas. Additionally, and while not required to do so, we have several franchisees committed to completing Vision remodels during 2017. Our team is working hard to value engineer the Vision prototype for both remodels as well as for new builds. Going forward, all new company-operated restaurants, which have not yet begun the permitting process, will open with the Vision design, including substantially all of our openings this year.	With that, I would like to turn the over to Larry, who will go over our fourth quarter results and 2017 guidance in detail. Larry?	Larry Roberts	Thanks, Steve. For the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2016, total revenue increased 7.2% to $92.5 million from $86.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The growth was largely the result of the increase in company operated restaurant sales, which rose 7.1% in the quarter to $86.5 million. This increase in company operated restaurant sales was driven by the contribution from the 29 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by a 0.6% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The decrease in company operated company restaurant sales was comprised of a 60 basis point decrease in transactions and a flat average check. Franchise revenue increased 7.8% in the quarter to $6 million, $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by the contributions from 16 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by comparable restaurant sales decline of 1.9%.	Turning to expenses, food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 80 basis points year-over-year to 30.6%. The improvement was predominantly due to lower commodity costs, particularly lower contracted chicken prices and freight costs. Looking ahead, we have locked in our chicken needs for the year and expect commodity deflation of about 2% for 2017. Labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 220 basis points year-over-year to 27.9%. The increase in labor expenses was driven by higher wage rates, reflecting the impact of California minimum wage increases and increased labor costs resulting from new restaurants opened in 2015 and 2016. For 2017, we expect labor inflation of about 4% as a result of minimum wage loss and tighter labor markets. Occupancy and other operating expenses, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased 160 basis points year-over-year to 23%. The increase was primarily due to rent expense and property taxes on new and renewed restaurant leases and an incremental cost related to opening new restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016.	General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $94,000 year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $8.9 million. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expenses decreased 60 basis points to 9.6%. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 included $369,000 in legal costs related to the securities class action litigation as compared to $993,000 of securities litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the costs associated with the securities litigation in both periods, G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased approximately $718,000 year-over-year and 20 basis points higher as a percentage of total revenue. This increase resulted primarily from higher stock option and legal expenses, partially offset by a reduction in our bonus accrual.	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $4.3 million from $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization increased 60 basis points year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by our new store development. During the quarter, we recorded a $5.9 million expense related to the full impairment of the assets of three restaurants; two in Texas and one in California as well as a partial impairment of another four restaurants. As is our policy, we continued to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets on a quarterly basis. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2016, we have closed two restaurants during the first quarter of 2017; one in Arizona and the other in Texas.	Prior to our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement that calls for us to pay our pre-IPO shareholders 85% of the tax savings realized as a result of utilizing our pre-IPO net operating losses and other tax attributes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $853,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting an estimated effective tax rate of 67.1%. This compares to a provision for income taxes of $4.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter. We reported GAAP net income of $418,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to a net income of $5.4 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the year ago period. In addition to our GAAP net income, we’ve calculated pro forma results adjusting for one-time or unusual items. To arrive at pro forma net income, we have made adjustments for expenses associated with the tax receivable agreement, gains or losses on disposable assets, asset impairment and store closure cost and legal expenses associated with the securities class action lawsuit. We have added back provision for income taxes and have applied a 40% income tax rate. Included in our earnings release is a reconciliation of our GAAP results to our pro forma results. We believe that the pro forma results provide a useful view of our business and cost structure. Accordingly, pro forma net income for the quarter was $4.6 million as compared to $6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Pro forma diluted earnings per share were $0.12 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.15 in the prior year period.	In terms of liquidity and balance sheet, we had $2.2 million in cash and equivalents as of December 28, 2016 and $104.5 million in debt outstanding. For the foreseeable future, we expect to finance our operations, including new restaurant development and maintenance capital through cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect capital expenditures to total $40 million to $45 million for the full year.	Turning to our 2017 guidance, we expect diluted net income per share of $0.65 to $0.69. This compares to pro forma diluted net income per share of $0.66 in 2016. Our pro forma net income guidance for 2017 is based in part on the following annual assumptions. We expect system wide comparable restaurant sales growth to be approximately flat to 2%, which includes first quarter comparable restaurant sales of negative 1% and negative 2% reflecting the weather impacts highlighted by Steve earlier. We expect to open 15 to 20 new company owned restaurants and expect our franchisees to open 8 to 12 new restaurants. We expect restaurant contribution margin of between 20.4% and 20.8%. We expect G&A expenses of between 8.5% and 8.7% of total revenue, which assumes that legal expenses related to securities class action litigation will be minimal. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $67 million and $70 million and we are using a pro forma income tax rate of 39.5%, which reflects our successful program to obtain warranty credits.	Now I will turn the call back over to Steve for closing remarks.	Steve Sather	Thanks Larry. We continue to steer through this challenging environment by focusing on what matters most to our guest, the value equation. By value, I don’t mean just price, but rather the food, service and environment that you get for the price. Initiatives such as our recent mobile and online ordering app, our new learning management system, our up-to-date vision design and our authentic advertising campaign highlighting our high quality food are all aimed at increasing the value equation, thereby strengthening our brand and driving financial results. We remain committed to the Texas market and are working hard to drive improved brand awareness, sales and profitability in Houston. We are on track with our 2017 development plans and we will continue to partner with high quality franchisees to build our pipeline for the future.	On a more personal note, as you may have seen it earlier today, I have informed the Board of my intention to retire by the end of this year, subject to the Board finding a suitable replacement. Over the last 40-plus years, I have been beyond fortunate to earn living in this great industry, including the last 11 years spent leading this special brand and team in multiple capacities. I am very proud of what we have accomplished in my time here. However, well I have my health, I have decided I would like to spend more time with my wife and family while also pursuing personal interests. As I have said repeatedly, El Pollo Loco continues to have tremendous opportunity of growth ahead of it and I intend to do everything I can to help ensure that the brand reaches its full potential.	Again, I would like to thank you for joining us on the call today. Now we would be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Operator?	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.	Jake Bartlett	Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is about, this earnings season, especially some of the late report have talked about a real deceleration in February, partly weather for California, but also related to tax refund delays, you haven’t mentioned that and so I am wondering whether you think it’s impacting you and also whether you can help us understand just the cadence of same-store sales as you have experienced them in the first quarter so far in your January versus February and then kind of more recent trends?	Steve Sather	Hi. This is Steve. We certainly are aware of some of the issues that everyone has pointed out. We did have weather impact in Q1. We actually think that’s going to be about 1% to 1.5% in Q1 this year and that’s why as we mentioned on the call, we think we will be 1% or 2% negative in Q1. So we think that we also – other things like the tax refund impact, we have heard that, we have heard that rebounded in the – towards the end of February when the actual refunds came out a little bit. It’s very hard to pinpoint that. But the weather certainly here in Southern California where we have a predominance of stores has affected us in Q1. Larry?	Larry Roberts	I will just add. You asked a question around the cadence during the quarter. It’s very difficult to judge for us the cadence during the quarter just because of the weather impact and what we have seen is a lot of volatility. Based on that weather, it’s been very up and down. Recently, we have had a string of good weather days and so we have seen a pop back up. That could also relate to tax refunds. But it’s just very difficult to measure a cadence just given the variability in the weather and whenever it hits, we see a drop off and then it rebounds and we get good weather. So I really can’t too much about whether we would really see a trend line or a real cadence during the quarter yet.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. So the weather – my impression was that it was more of a February event. But you are saying that it was kind of – it’s been pretty continual in February and/or in January and February?	Larry Roberts	It’s been more probably late January and February, but certainly, there was a weather impact in January also.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. And then on the unit targets, it looks like the franchise target for ‘17 is a little lower than where you came out in ‘16, any reason for that or are there any markets that are kind of slowing down or any kind of commentary around the development targets?	Steve Sather	Yes. This is Steve. No particular market and most of our – we have our Texas development, which about half of the company will be – development will be in Texas. Our franchisee continues to develop in Dallas and in Houston there as well down – as down in the Rio Grande Valley. But there is no – if you look at the – on the franchise side Utah still developing, Southern California some development here, not really…	Larry Roberts	The only thing I would add to that is I think what you are seeing is relatively flat development. I think that reflects – I think we have consistently said that, in order to really ramp up development, we need to get new franchisees in the system, especially into our markets. And we have brought some new people in, but it’s going to take them a little while to get geared up and start developing. And so I think right now, when we look at 2017, that’s what we are calling for relatively flat development.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. And then it looks like there was a closure in the fourth quarter. If I am right about that, where was the closure in the franchise side?	Larry Roberts	I think we are checking on that.	Steve Sather	Okay. It could have been in that WKS and…?	Larry Roberts	Watsonville. Franchise in Watsonville.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. Thank you very much.	Steve Sather	Thank you.	Operator	Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.	Matthew DiFrisco	Thank you. You have mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about this family value, I wondered if you could talk specifically about maybe give us some numbers that you thought as far as the bundle, the $20 family bundle, how that worked as a percentage of sales potentially or did that index to where you thought it would or was it a little bit under indexed?	Steve Sather	Yes. We do – no, we were very pleased with the – in module 1 as we mentioned we ran the family choice meal, which included eight pieces of chicken, two sides and the consumer’s choice of a family size super salad and that ran about 8% of the chicken – or 8% of our mix, which was very strong. We think that $20 price point is very key on these family meals and you will see that emphasize throughout this year. We are currently offering another family program, that’s two additional sides with any family meal for $3 and we are seeing good performance on that, but we like the $20 price point on that as well. So you will see those testing in and out this year.	Matthew DiFrisco	So in general, has the family ordering on a proportion basis on a year-over-year, can you give us some context to that, is that – are these drivers to it and expanding it as a share of the menu or are you still sort of in recoup mode in trying to get back to where you are at higher levels historically in years past?	Larry Roberts	Yes. Matt, with this offering, we saw a nice jump up in our family meal mix. I mean we were back up around 29% or so versus I think we are running probably around 27% last year. So that meal, the increase we saw in the family meal itself which was a jump of about somewhere around 6% up to 8% corresponded to an increase in the overall family meal mix.	Steve Sather	And while we have reengineered these, it’s also improved our margins on those because they are different offering than our prior 3-course family meal.	Matthew DiFrisco	Great. And then I guess if you look at the flat check, can you just give us the composites, I am sorry, if I missed that, did you say what the menu price increase was in there?	Larry Roberts	The menu price increased about 1.5% which leads you to do a mix of negative 1.5%, really driven by the fall off in the family meal mix that we saw in the fourth quarter. But really, we saw all of last year and saw more in the fourth quarter.	Matthew DiFrisco	Okay. But you were up year-over-year, 29% in family meals versus 27% in the fourth quarter?	Larry Roberts	No, no, that was [indiscernible] first quarter this year. Yes, I am sorry, if you look at fourth quarter last year we were down in family meals.	Matthew DiFrisco	Got it. So you can say that then you have corrected – you are addressing the issue and it seems to be responding?	Larry Roberts	So far so good, yes.	Matthew DiFrisco	Excellent. And then my last question, I guess if we were to look at the margins and the amount of deleverage, you did just incur with only a slight, I call it miss on the comp number, is this a scenario still though where maybe labor, obviously range you can’t predict so well, so if the sales were more consistent in a trend basis that you would have been able to manage these margins, I am just trying to get to was there some surprise and volatility driven by weather causing the weakness in the comp that might have exacerbated some de-leverage on the labor line, I am just trying to get better a handle on how much labor opportunity there could be in a better comp environment longer term?	Larry Roberts	Yes. So looking at the fourth quarter – I mean just to reflect if I look at year-on-year, I think Q4 last year about 21.7% restaurant operating profit, 2016 came in at 18.5%. And the biggest driver of that was our 2015 and ‘16 bills, which I have highlighted previously. That was about a 230 basis point drag on overall margins. If I look at labor, that was down about 1.5 percentage points. I think it certainly had the combination of the minimum wage and other wage inflation exacerbated by the fact that you had negative comps. To be honest with you I haven’t gone really through and figured out well, how much of the negative comp impacted that, but certainly, those are the numbers I have to go through and calculate how much negative comps drove that negative 1.5% labor shortfall. But again, you had the wage inflation with negative comps. That combination was about 1.5% or 1.5 percentage points of labor de-leverage.	Matthew DiFrisco	Right, but in your guidance for 1Q though also I am assuming that there is some conservative guidance in there because of the weather, very hard to manage the labor margins in this current quarter, so that’s incorporated in your guidance as well?	Larry Roberts	Yes.	Matthew DiFrisco	Okay. Thank you, guys.	Larry Roberts	Alright.	Operator	Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.	David Tarantino	Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions, first on the impairments, can you provide a little bit more detail on the locations that were impaired? I think you gave us 2 were in Texas, 1 in California. Could you talk about where the other 4 were and sort of the characteristics of the restaurants that you are impairing? Is there anything to be learned on, I guess, what didn’t meet your expectations on those?	Larry Roberts	Yes. So David, the other 4 restaurants that had partial impairments, 3 were in Houston and 1 was Los Angeles. The one in Los Angeles is a very old unit. So, there wasn’t much of a impact from that one. Steve talked more about the outlook on Houston overall. I will focus on the accounting side. And as we have highlighted, we do the quarterly impairment reviews every quarter. We actually start looking at restaurants and measuring whether we should impair them or not after about a year of being open. And so we have ran basically the models. And just from an accounting standpoint and kind of ignoring the Houston market situation and again Steve will talk to that, we just decided that these restaurants from our accounting perspective and based on our accounting guidelines, that we should go ahead and impair a couple of them full impairment and then, like I said, 3 other restaurants to have partial impairment in the quarter.	Steve Sather	Yes. And David on Houston and as we talked on the call and mentioned the last call, we are not happy with our current sales. They are underperforming our expectations. But during December, January and February of this year, actually we initiated tests there to improve sales and with a number of different elements and tactics to drive the sales. Some of these we think are very – have seen that are successful and we have expanded those now to the other stores in Houston and used them in Dallas as well. And some of these where we used Street teams to go around the stores, focus on businesses, talk about our catering, educate people with menus about El Pollo Loco. Ed and his team tested different coupon drops and FSI drops. We also had radio advertising now that we are utilizing there and greater community involvement, too. We are doing fundraisers there. And we have seen those, while not bringing them to where we want initially we have seen tangible improvement in those store sales. We have also focused on our operations in Houston to just make sure, because that’s ever so important as they have a great experience there and we have relocated several of our top management people there as well. And finally, we are just starting to conduct research with Ipsos consumer research. And what we will do there is we will do a deep dive into the consumer experience at the restaurants and really continue to understand and stay in the market. Again, we used some of these and some of these elements in Dallas. Dallas, it’s still early in Dallas, but they are performing in line with our expectations, so little bit different market in the Dallas market.	David Tarantino	And then just – that’s very helpful, Steve. Thank you. Just following up on this, is there any sort of way you could mention where the locations are in Houston in terms of volumes versus where you need them to be to earn the cost of capital or to meet your hurdle rates? Is it – anything you can offer there? Are they at 70% of what you wanted or 80%, 90%, anything in that sort of thinking that you could share with us?	Larry Roberts	We normally haven’t given details like that. I mean, I think, David, all I would say is obviously, if your – if a restaurant that’s failing impairment test, the volumes are – we originally set a target of, I think it was what 28.8 was the target in Houston. So they are fairly far below that at this time. Again, I think we still feel like we will be able to drive sales in those restaurants. But at this time, using our accounting guidelines, we just said they are far enough below that we feel like we should impair them.	David Tarantino	Great. And then last question on this front is some of the efforts, it sounds like you are getting some traction early. Is there a lot of investment that you have baked into your guidance in Houston or is it, I guess, measurable as you think about the impact on the earnings for this year?	Larry Roberts	No. Really, David, the only incremental investment in, I’ll call it, Houston, Dallas, similar to last year is about $300,000 of incremental marketing spend over and above the 5% marketing contribution. Most of things we are doing there are, they are not super high cost and a lot of it’s more FSI drops and those type of things, which are part of our normal advertising budget. The three teams are a little bit incremental, but even that going forward be covered in our advertising budget, so not a lot of this is actually incremental over and above the 5% plus the $300,000.	David Tarantino	Great. Thank you very much.	Operator	[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.	Christopher Carril	Hi, guys. This is Chris on for John. So, I wanted to get your sense of how you are thinking about the comp gap between the company franchise stores in 2017. I know the gap had been narrowing over the course of ‘16. But given that company comps flipped to better than franchisee comps this quarter, wanted to get your sense about that gap in ‘17 and whether you think that it’s going to start pointing towards historical norms? I think it’s been a couple of 100 bps difference. So, any sense there will be great?	Steve Sather	Well, Chris, this is Steve. The franchisees have been a little bit more aggressive on taking price this year and I think that’s impacted their transaction growth. So that’s where you have seen that company start to perform stronger. Larry, the balance of this year, I would say it will probably be pretty close.	Larry Roberts	Well, I think, Steve, what you are highlighting is last year as we saw that gap between our pricing and franchisees pricing, you start seeing a change in transactions and it kind of built during the year, I think that’s one reason why you see in Q4 company comp sales outperform franchise comp sales. Going into ‘17, right now, what we are kind of assuming is roughly be on par with each other. Again, we don’t yet see entirely what franchisees are doing around pricing. I think they will be a little more reserved than they were say last year. I could be wrong. But right now we think they will be basically comp sales or company or franchise sales will roughly be in line with each other.	Steve Sather	Yes. We focus very much on the, what we call that value equation and working with our franchisees to clearly understand that it’s not just price, it’s the food, service, environment over the price, and all of that is really that value equation. And I think the – especially with our focus on the $20 family meal that franchisees have recognized the importance of that.	Christopher Carril	Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. And with regard to pricing or your pricing in ‘17, I apologize if we gave that already, but what are you baking into the guidance?	Larry Roberts	It’s about 1.5% price for the year.	Steve Sather	Okay. We are currently up to 1.5%. And in the spring, we have a potential to go up there. Normally, we do something in late fall, but we will analyze those very closely, because we want to maintain that value equation.	Larry Roberts	Yes. Just to make sure, the pricing we are contemplating in the spring will basically be in line with what we took in last year to maintain that 1.5% pricing. We feel like we want to be a little bit cautious and not get too aggressive on price just given the competitive environment.	Christopher Carril	Got it. Thank you.	Operator	Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.	Matt Curtis	Good afternoon. It’s Matt Curtis on for Sharon. Just going back to the previous question on the restaurant level margin guidance, I guess I still don’t quite see how the guidance calls for restaurant level margins to stay roughly flat on a flat to 2% comp this year. When if you look at last year, you guys were down over 100 basis points on margins when you had a similar comp?	Larry Roberts	Yes. So, let me kind of walk you through our thinking on the margin piece. First of all, whereas last year we saw a pretty big drop as a result of 2015 and ‘16 builds. I don’t expect to see as much as a negative in 2017 just because I expect 2015 maybe to be slightly accretive to margins and ‘16 maybe slightly negative as they come online this year, but nothing like the magnitude we saw last year. Probably more importantly, when you look at the pricing we are taking and the overall calendar, I think overall calendar we will look at maintaining our food costs based on promotional calendar in line with last year. And then we are also going to get some food cost upside from our lower commodity costs. We are expecting deflation of somewhere around 2%, maybe even a little north of 2%. Those, when you combine all that, will offset the labor inflation we expect to see in our business. So that’s why we feel like margin wise we will be somewhere around flat.	Matt Curtis	Okay, alright, that helps. And then on the impairments and closures, well, I guess on the closures, could you explain what the P&L impact is from those store closures, either in terms of revenue or EPS?	Larry Roberts	I will say in terms of margins, I know it’s about a two-tenth improvement in margin. If I look at overall restaurant operating profit is as much as about $1 million and that us pre-tax.	Matt Curtis	Okay, got it. Thank you.	Operator	Our next question is a follow-up from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.	Jake Bartlett	Great. Thanks. Just kind of following-up on the questions about the margins, I am trying to understand COGS, I know your – I think your guidance has been about 4% deflation in ‘16, what did you experience in ‘16 for deflation and then why didn’t you get more of a benefit in the fourth quarter, it looks like it would imply much lower deflation in the fourth quarter?	Larry Roberts	Yes. So what it was is we had overall deflation for the year. I think it was north of 4%. It’s more in the range of 4.5%. But that – and I think it came up the previous call actually is our expectation in the fourth quarter, was we would see a little bit less of that just because some of laps actually came through in the fourth quarter. So some of the upside that we had in the first three quarters, we did not get in the fourth quarter because we are already had that – we were lapping that back into Q4 of the previous year. So we always thought fourth quarter deflation would be a little bit lower. And then we also from a calendar perspective, I believe that promotional calendar was a little bit more expensive in the fourth quarter. So combined those resulted in a lower COGS improvement versus the previous quarters.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. So you are saying that in ‘17 that you are not going to have any impact from the calendar, it’s going to be more of a pure just math on menu price and deflation?	Larry Roberts	Primarily, although I think there is a little bit of calendar impact for the year.	Jake Bartlett	Sorry, there should be, so – it’s just not that straight math?	Larry Roberts	Yes. I think a straight math will get you most of way there. But like I said, I think there is a little bit of calendar benefit. But the straight math of just looking at the overall COGS deflation should get you most of the way there. And of course, then the price increase also on top of that.	Jake Bartlett	And should it be pretty even 2% deflation throughout the year or just end the year with less and start more or how should we think about that?	Larry Roberts	No, it should be even through the year.	Jake Bartlett	Okay. And then just kind of bookkeeping question, but could you give us the system wide sales in the fourth quarter?	Steve Sather	Yes. System wide sales in the fourth quarter was $190.6 million.	Jake Bartlett	Okay, that is great. And then I guess lastly one question on the app, so you have three months under your belt, what have you learned, has it – how has the mix been in terms of the number of orders, has it posed any more challenges or less challenges operationally, what’s the experience been so far?	Steve Sather	We are very pleased with our – the apps that we rolled out really late in fourth quarter. We are seeing about 0.7% to 0.8% of sales going through that. I just had pulled some figures this morning actually. We have had 55,000 orders in 94 days that we have used it. Our average check is higher on that. We think as we roll mobile, which we are going to test the mobile in our Las Vegas market...	Larry Roberts	Delivery.	Steve Sather	I am sorry, delivery at the end of this period, we think – and then we will roll that in quarter two. And then also loyalty in quarter two, we think that will also drive that. So we are very pleased with the system so far.	Jake Bartlett	Great. Thank you very much.	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to over to Mr. Steve Sather for closing comments.	Steve Sather	I would like to thank everybody for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in El Pollo Loco. And thank you, operator.	Operator	This concludes today’s conference.

13,Call End:,RIO,"Companhia de Bebidas das Americas, AmBev (NYSE:ABEV)",Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call,"March 2, 2017 11:00 PM ET	Executives	Bernardo Paiva - CEO	Ricardo Rittes - CFO & IR Officer	Analysts	Pedro Leduc - JP Morgan	Luca Cipiccia - Goldman Sachs	Lauren Torres - UBS	Robert Ottenstein - Evercore	Alex Robart - Citi Group	Operator	Good morning and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AmBev's Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2016 Results Conference Call.

We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer session. At that time, further instructions will be given.

Now I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Ricardo Rittes, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Rittes, you may begin your conference.	Ricardo Rittes	Hello everyone, thank you for joining our 2016 fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. I will now guide you through operational highlights of Brazil, CAC, LAS, and Canada, including our below-the-line items and cash flow. And after that, Bernardo will give you more details about our performance in Brazil and how we are positioning ourselves for the year to come.	Starting with the main highlights of our consolidated results. 2016 proved to be one of the most challenging years of our history. As solid growth in our international operation was offset by a negative performance in Brazil on a consolidated basis. Top-line was up 0.4% in the quarter and the full-year.	Top-line was up 1.9% with volume decline of 5.8% more than offset by a net revenue for the growth of 8.3%. EBITDA was down 12.1% in the quarter and 6.9% in the full-year reaching 19.5 with an EBITDA margin of 42.7%. Net profit was up 13.5% in the quarter while on a normalized basis net profit was down 15.9%. In the full-year net profit was 1.6% while adjusted by exceptional items net profit was down 9.7%.	The difference between reported and normalized profit is driven by the swap of assets carried out with ADI person to each of a greater transfer our businesses in Columbia, in exchange for the Panama business originally owned by transaction when accounted for using the proceeding value for the Panama asset and the cost value for that ADI resulted in our 1.2 BNRI non-cash gain.	In Brazil, our EBITDA was down 19.7% in the full-year. We are nothing but disappointed with our performance but it is important to understand the main drivers that have impacted our full-year results. The first one is connected to the adverse micro economic scenario in Brazil. Economic activity reduced for the second consecutive year with unemployment rate peaking the higher rate recorded in year leading to the continuous decline of disposable income into the environment we also lost 120 basis points of market share for beer from 67.5% in 2015 to 66.3% in 2016.	The second one is that in the first quarter of 2016 we are subject to increase in some states putting additional pressure on our top-line. And the third one is related to the temporary impact of the FX in our cash COG. As we are very systematic with our hedging policy it is the -- of Brazil in the second half of 2015 when the Brazil, depreciated cost 60% year-over-year has inflated our cost in the second half of the 2016. Now going to more detail of operational results in Brazil. CSD & NANC top-line was now 11.5% in the quarter and 5.7% in the full-year. Our beer volumes were down 7.3% in the quarter and 6.6% in the full-year given the challenging macroeconomic environment. Our total market share for the year according to Neil was 66.3% versus 67.5% 2015. That revenue [Indiscernible] in beer was up 4.6% in the quarter as we had hard comparable in the fourth quarter of 2015 while on a sequential basis it was up 17.3% driven our revenue management initiative implemented during the quarter in the full-year. Net revenue per hectoliter was up 1.1% mainly impacted by tax increase in addition as part of our revenue management strategy we use along the year our -- tax and brand to achieve more attractive consumer price including 300 returnable borrows that accounted for 23% of our volume in supermarket in 2016.	Now talking about Brazil CSD & NANC. The top-line was up 1.7% in the quarter and down 2.7% in the full-year. Volumes decline 6.7% in the quarter and 6% in the full-year evaluating industry as we estimate. As the adverse consumer environment is temporarily driving consumers away from CSD to low cost powdered juices or even to tap water.	Net revenue per hectoliter was up 9% in the quarter and 3.5% in the full-year driven by our price management initiative, our market share according to NANC was 18.8%. Our Brazil cash COG per hectoliter and cash COG increase respectively 20% and 11.5% in the quarter. In the full-year cash COG per hectoliter was up 15.4% and cash COG increase by 7.9% in line with our guidance of mid to high single digit growth. The main driver for this performance was temporary impact of effects partially offset by the benefit of RBGs coupled with a continuous evolution of our cost initiative.	Brazil cash SG&A was up 2.2% in the quarter. In the full-year cash SG&A was up 3.5% which while below inflation is in the upper limit of our guidance due to mid single digit logistic cost increase, increase of administrative cost by low double digit and high single digit increase in sales and marketing expense as we continue to invest in our brand. As a result Brazil dollar jumped 30.8% in the quarter and 19.7% in the full-year. Bernardo would expand on this topic and discuss how we are positioned ourselves for 2017.	Now moving to Central America and the Caribbean. In CAC we delivered another solid year. Our performance in the region was driven by double-digit top-line growth with a good balance between volume and revenue management. Going to more details, in the fourth quarter EBITDA in the region increased by 25.4% reaching BRL398 mainly driven by net revenue growth of 8.9% in the full-year top-line was up 14% leading to an EBITDA of BRL1.4 an increase of 21.3% with a margin expansion of 120 basis points to 37.3%.	While, the quarter volumes increased by 6.2% in the full-year mainly driven by the Dominican Republic where we were able to significantly increase the {indiscernible] reaching our highest ever share of -- and Guatemala where we have another year of market share gains with the strong performance of our Mexican brand let by Corona that grew double digit in the year. Going forward we continue to side of top-line and EBITDA growth potential for our current operations and other non-organic opportunities including Panama that became part of CAG as of December 31, 2016 pushing us closer to our dream of $1 billion EBITDA in the region. In the America, in the quarter top-line was up 19.3% and EBITDA grew 27.6% in the full year top-line increased by 15.8% and EBITDA by 20.6%. Volumes were down 2.8% in the quarter and 8.3% in the full-year as the weakness in Argentina given the diverse micro economic environment was partially offset by strong performance in number one Bolivia, driven by 710 M.L returnable glass bottle {indiscernible] and with the marketing improvement. Number two, Paraguay with the successful rollout of our 340 M.L returnable glass bottle and the premium growth led by Corona -- and finally Chile with strong performance of our global brand in the country. Top-line benefited from solid net revenue performance due to higher rate of our premier beer volumes and implementation of our revenue management strategy.	We used cost and expense were two -- for high inflation and currency movement specially in Argentina. We are able to offset these impacts through top-line growth delivering our margin expansion in the quarter of 320 basis points to 48.4% and in the full-year of 80 basis points to 44.1%. As we move forward we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid top-line in the region in the short term and better position ourselves for the future.	Turning now to Canada. In the quarter EBITDA in Canada increased by 3.2% reaching for BRL191 as the organic top-line decline up 0.5% was offset by lower cost driven margin expansion of 140 basis points. In the full year our top-line was up 0.7% and EBITDA declined 0.8% organically while increased 3% in local current when included our strategic brands of the fast growing craft segment.	Such as [indiscernible] volumes grew 5.7% in the full-year mainly driven by the benefit of our recent acquisition helped us achieve the highest market share figure in 17 years. Organic volumes were down 1.2% impacted by unfavorable weather partially offset by strong performance for number one, Bud Light in the segment as the fastest growing brand in Canada in 2016 and in the high end reaching its highest share ever in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year we remain focused on pursuing an optimal balance between volume and price with our revenue management initiative and the benefit of increased premier mix 2.3% net revenue per liter growth in the fourth quarter and 1.8% growth in the full-year.	Going forward we are very excited with our moment in Canada with our complete portfolio and committed to continue to balance net revenue per liter and market share to deliver profitable growth. Now moving to other operating income. Other operating income totaled BRL158 in the quarter versus BRL701 of last year. Mainly driven by the reduction of [indiscernible] in Brazil from BRL530 to BRL196 due to number one, volume decline and revenue geographic mix as we have different incentives in different plants around Brazil and number two, expiration of government grants agreements that represent around 25% of the reduction in this line. In the full-year other operating income totaled BRL1.2 versus BRL1.9 of last year. Also mainly explained by the decline of government grants as a result of low volumes and revenue geographic mix. Now to EBITDA. In the fourth quarter we started to revert a negative trends in this quarter as our net financial results decline almost 20% year-over-year, on BRL1.1 million in the fourth quarter 2015 to BRL908 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.	Going to more details. Main item in the financial expense in the quarter were: First, interest income of BRL86 million driven by our cash balance mainly in Brazil Real, US dollars and Canadian dollars. Second, and expense of BRL416 million due to interest expense. Goes 40% of this is a non-cash accrual related to the put option associated with our investment into Dominican Republic. As part of the CND deal in 2012 A put option exercise qo into 2019 was issued which may result in an acquisition by AmBev's of the remaining shares of CND. For a value base on EBITDA multiple these noncash accrue expenses, increases over time as we approach 2019 as EBITDA grow among other factors.	Third, BRL292 million losses on derivative instruments, mainly driven by the carry cost of our FX had primarily linked to our cargo exporter in Brazil and Argentina. Given the interest rate differential between Brazilian real or Argentine Peso's to the US Dollars. We have financial costs associated to these hatches, which are called Carry costs. Carry costs has started to go down mainly due to the reverse of the Brazilian Real. It's clear and or Argentine Peso appreciates our interest rates in this count has continued to go down. Carry costs are expected to decline even further.	Fourth. Non-derivative gains and losses have been another source of volatility in our net financial results, as most of the results including design are related to FX translation. As we benefitted from the DI appreciation in the quarter, we had a gain of BRL220 million in this line. Fifth. For BRL101 million of order financial expenses mainly driven by interest on contingency in the full year. That financial results totaled BRL3.7 billion mainly driven by underline interest expenses which include the put option of our investment into Dominican Republic of around BRL600 million and losses on derivative instruments.	The FX tax rate in the quarter was 9.9% versus 28.3% last year. In the full-year, the effective tax rate was 2.4% mainly driven by gains on audit tax adjustments reported in the third quarter of which. First, around BRL400 million is explained by reversion of a withholding tax provision related to unremitted earnings from Argentina as of July 23rd 2016 and new legislation Argentina was enacted revoking the levy of withholding tax over the remittance that was created in 2013. And second goes to BRL800 million driven by a onetime impact in the third quarter of '16 on the recognition of differed tax assets on care losses related to international subsidiaries.	From a cash flow perspective, in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activity before changing our chapter was BRL6.1 billion. We continue to revert the negative cash impact from working capital seen in the first and second quarters, generating almost BRL1.8 billion for working capital. In the full-year, cash generated from operations reached BRL17.7 billion in CapEx totaled BRL4.1 billion. With CapEx in Brazil declining 35% year-over-year to BRL2.0 billion in line with our guidance.	Finally, during 2016 we turn at approximately BRL10 billion to equity holders in dividends and interest among capital. This figure does not include the dividend payment of approximately BRL1.1 billion announced on December 22nd but made only in February 23rd 2017. As a free cash flow generation continued to grow sequential in the year 2016, we also continue to return the excess cash to shareholders.	Thank you, very much. I will now move to Bernardo before going to Q&A.	Bernardo Paiva	Thank you, Ricardo. Hello, everyone. We've been through a tough year especially in Brazil where as stated by Ricardo, three main drivers have impacted our results. One, the external conditions are very challenged with a volatile political and economic macro environment and negative disposal income leading to the industry decline. Two, on top of the preceding industry, some states have significant increase this year too, despite of the in the strong mobilizations to qualify the higher taxation bring to recession instead of additional revenues for the state.	Three, our cost was impacted by the fact especially in the second half of the year comprising our margin. We acknowledge that Brazil's long-term growth involves a vital skews of volatility and as the Brazilians are facing a very tough environment. With the measure of the foremost, these absolute and we are not pleased refer to any '16 results at all. With that in mind, I want to concentrate my comments in Brazil before we move to the Q&A.	The theory is that support our long-term growth in Brazil as today, favorable demographics with reduction of regional disparities includes few more continued demand for innovative products and stronger end. Based on that, we made stricter investments in our business, hosting a five commercial product forms in a transformation away. That is we celebrate the core, our first and most -- platform.	In the last two years, and the core was even high in our journal. And think that's in more time and resource to have the right in size to bring innovation and innovation to our mainstream brand. A good news is that some of the outputs of such initiative are started to hit the market as we speak. For instance, we are launching new VDI's for Isco and Brahma. Differentiating and the foresee the brands attribute.	We are also improving our primary and secondary package, enhancing the brands quality perception. This innovation itself to implement in the end of 2016 and we see it's magnitude if you continue to be rolled out along 2017. For the results are rate positive. For example, as with consumers have shown that cause new visual brand identity has improved significantly its attributes of quality, drinkability and modernity. And it has also increased consumers interest in the brand purchase.	To talk about score. Alright, easy to drink lager. They had don’t decide to say campaign has been during scarcity attribute some prop of the carefully crafted emotional connection of the brand with its core consumers. Score, also land our summer in can or bottlization causing the most important drink for us in Brazil such as Skol and savor, delivering great experience to which causes. Our complete through execution through above the line 3D digital media and increased activation has enabled score to more than 35 million people made in this can above the digits of its history.	Now, talk about Brahma. Brahma is our classic lager, recognizing for its beer expertise and flavor. Brahma has a strong connection with its consumers who drink Brahma together with soccer in country music platform. Brazilians strong passion. Brahma is the sponsor of several country music events, such as dealer mix, Brazil, largest country music festival. Let's talk about platform. Brings regions proximity for the brand to see the sponsorship and discuss those program. Rumor spanning is also composed by Brahma, or getting the food and flavor needs the and we have three variants, lager, red lager and rice.	Brahma is and has grown 250% definitely shaping the core plus fragment in the Brazilian market and enhancing the mother brand. Finally, on Antarctica. Antarctica is being strengthening its connection with Rio de Janeiro and with the Southern music. It just launched a novelty media company which more than 10 million people with lines A to Z series in YouTube. Antarctica was this official sponsor of the carnival region for the three consecutive time. Those who were there could see the strong press of the brand and the blue ocean.	On top of being a strong regional brand, Antarctica has became aspiration in other region, such as the Mid-West of Brazil also becoming the number one brand in three states in this region. Over the course of 2017, our three mainstream brands and continue to leverage is strengthened the connection in the core palette consumers and support our topline growth. Moving to premium. Premiere has been growing and gaining weight over the years and in 2016, it was not different. Work is a complete portfolio of international to domestic brands. Premier rather presents more than 10% of our wine.	Premier has also very high bracket way above its market share. Budweiser our main brand and has been delivering amazing results, it's more than too many percent in 2016, a double-digit score for the fifth consecutive year and consolidated position of the leading brand in the three main segment in Brazil. Budweiser's preference and brand, that's good, which is some simplicity, heritage and quality, are continuing trending. Now talk about Near Beer. Near Bear is right incremental volumes in a profitable way.	One of the most successful visions in our history, continue to grow double-digit in 2016. We have lager liquid with its red bottle that together sends and spirit and rather represent more in 1% of our beer volume in Brazil. With massive presence in the key brand in fairly -- and the strong accusation during carnival, the who will try to beat them also enhance the equity of the mother brand. Moving to different location, is starting with the in-home. RGB's they are selling update focus this year. The returnable grass ball was boosted by the national campaign meaning everything that's good return.	Turning to our core brands, and has an affordable preposition. They will represent a 22% of beer volumes in the supermarket in 2016. Going forward with a strong learning process we improve even more the execution and as a consequence we see the is for me is even more important and definitely change in consumers behavior. He's a huge chief with import application. As it's good for everyone and we put a drink, it's good for the environmental as well and good for mind. Finally, in the some occasion, we took the soft marker scenario as put to an enter a long-term sponsorship contract. Expand your acquisition and send. Along with that we are stepping up our root market initiatives, we assure an improved service level everywhere giving a strong platform to meet our brands even more agreeable in the point-of-sale with the best in class execution.	In summary, 2016 has been the top here under the hand we took this morning as an opportunity to strength our foundations for the future and we meet stricter investment in our business. On top of that, is widely expected to be a year in which main marker had win. First, inflation continues to decelerate. Second, to repeat you're estimated to be flattish. As of two consecutive years of decline. Third, unemployment. What is still increasing expected to revert the trend in the [indiscernible].	Despite our income, it's likely to resume growth towards the end of the year. This environment we are cautiously optimist, in the Brazilian industry in 2017, especially for the second half of the year. Our commitment is long-term in nature and we are confident on our be to be market share and resume our topline and be the growth supported by such investments with me and recent years and by this strength of our brand. As part of our coach, our motivation to deliver beer has not changing.	It has even increased, that said it's important to highlight that our market share for 2017 is increasing in a positive trend showing that we are in the right path. Along with that, we expect cash cost per hectoliter to positively evolve over 2017. Increasing the put in the first half and low-single digits to flattish in the second half, main explain by the impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian Real during the first half of 2016.	We can move now to the Q&A. Thank you.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator Instruction] The first question comes from [indiscernible] Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open on our end. It is muted on yours.	Unidentified Analyst	Sure. Good morning everyone. Thank you for the call. I have two questions. First, you guys mentioned the expiration of some tax benefits impacted at the other operating income if you could tell us if you already able to renew those benefits or it's not if there is any expectation of doing that and second when we look at the guidance for 2017 you guys provided much less detail compared to what we saw in the previous years. If you could explain a rational of doing that because there is lower visibility at this point or for competitive reasons. Thank you.	Ricardo Rittes	Hi, this is Ricardo. Thank you for question. Well let me start with your second question. So, just as I start for that answer our guidance has varied along the years. So if you go back 2010 we had only COG, EBITDA. 2011 was COGs, volume and CapEx 2012 was COGs volume of Brazil, net revenue, CapEx so and so forth. So it varies across the years. We have not being like with the same guidance for a long period of time. For 2017, we decided we provide more qualitative guidance in the outlook session to limit the top-line	numbers as only Brazilian beer market gave guidance over the course of 2016. Therefore driving to a symmetric competitive dynamic and this is the reason behind our the way we gave the guidance for 2017 and when we go to your first question discussing specific in the income it was down mainly driven by the reduction of the government grants like you said and this reduction essentially came for the two reasons, number one was the volume decline and the revenue geographic mix which explains 75% of the decline and expiration of government grants agreement that represents around 25%. We decided to give this break down in order for people to be able to separate and differentiate between what is consequence of the mix and the temporary impact and what has expired. With index expiration that's when you asked your question is can you renew it etcetera I just -- concession of government grants is primarily linked to CapEx and from time to time we may decide not to make this investment resulting a loss of efficiencies and tax incentives. So when you look at 2016 CapEx which was down 35% in Brazil year-over-year from BRL3.1 to BRL2.0 I think that's a driver that you need to take into consideration when projecting going forward. As you see Brazil accelerating CapEx increasing you could see difference in the…	Unidentified Analyst	Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Pedro Leduc with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.	Pedro Leduc	Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question and with regarding to pricing in Brazil do you - we saw sequential improvement I know about 17% or BRL284 per hectoliter this quarter. Now just trying to reconcile imagine how we can carry this figure into 2017 because there wouldn't be the mid to high single digit increase if you keep the 284 into the full average of 2017. so just help us understand, you already have the full pricing effects of 4Q then how much usually in 1Q is not sequentially not price per hectoliter drop if it this year it's going to be as substantial as it was in the last year, last 1Q and just trying to reconcile here how should we imagine pricing if we can carry this nice number into 2017. Thank you.	Ricardo Rittes	Hi Pedro. Thank you very much for your question. So like you said on a sequential basis, net revenue per hectoliter was up 17.3% and just to remind everyone that excise tax expiration impact consumers but even a fully compensated buy would not impact net revenue per hectoliter and therefore as a result net revenue per hectoliter is a good proxy of price increase net of tax increases if you will. As a consequence the longer it appear the better or more precise is the visibility of the net revenue per hectoliter as a result you should expect some volatility in that line. For instance, if we go five for example sorry, five years our net revenue per hectoliter has increased in line with inflation despite of short term volatility. Having said that we continue to be confident of our strategy to increase our price in line with inflation and for that I think just to develop a little bit on that I think first it's very important most important for us to give strong brand and this is the key to ensure the profitability of our business and that's why our first commercial platform is [indiscernible].	Second along the time we have improved a lot of revenue management strategy initiative mainly through technology and price strategy allowing us to capture also significant net revenue per hectoliter opportunity. And third when you look going forward I think it's very important to take into consideration premium end year, as they continue to grow driving a positive mix impact on the other hand the growth of returnable glass bottle presents the challenge for the future when you look only as net revenue per hectoliter in the perspective although they are margin accretive and they are good for business.	Pedro Leduc	Okay. Ricardo thank you and then just again back of to 2017 should we expect this figure growing in line with inflation again or you still expect another shift mix and returnables just to get some color. Thank you.	Ricardo Rittes	The type of guidance that we are giving like we said in the guidance the discussion previously is a bit of a more qualitative guidance we are not guidance _ quarter-by-quarter basis but the drivers behind the volatility in that line _ so we continue to be confident about our strategy to increase our price _ inflation _ and the shorter the period of time that you look you see like I have seen in the past some volatility in the line _ out of this extraordinary and it continue to be very confident about this strategy.	Pedro Leduc	Thank you. That helps.	Operator	The next question comes from Luca Cipiccia with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	Luca Cipiccia	Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask two, one as more of a clarification on the returnable penetration. I think in the third quarter you said it was 25% and I think in the release I think it's 23. I was wondering if it is just function of seasonality or am I interpreting this incorrectly and more generally can you update us on not necessarily your push into this format but how consumer reception adaption is evolving and how much you think it will stick assuming that eventually as you _ well the consumer will recall it and that's my first question and then the second very quickly just going back on the guidance we sort of got used to the idea that you preferred to talk about the things that you can control and you expressed that lot in the past I am not sure I follow the rational to not give indication about both SG&A and CapEx which I think in the past were fairly discretionary items for you to decide on how to spend on how to invest in any given year and on the CapEx and _ about are there before is it fair then to assume that as a percentage of revenue _ other income should - we should probably _ to what we saw in the first quarter given some benefits are expiring and some others are more _ long growth and CapEx but I would assume CapEx is not going to go up this year. So maybe if you can clarify a little bit on this point it will be great.	Bernardo Paiva	Hi Luca. I think the _ and important to highlight RBG became from 4% in the _ 2014 to 23 _ supermarket in 2016. So no doubt there is a great success. I mean it's good for everyone to always talk I mean people to drink, good for environment, good for margins as well. On top of that _ have shown that diminish have increased _ royalty among their buyers with positive impact on brand attributes such as flavor, eco-friendly, and cost benefit proposal. It has also improved the perception of heritage of the brand due to the _ having said that going forward as we improve the execution we see _ become even more important that may change the consumer habit. And quarter-by-quarter this could vary but the main number is as you came from in 2014 4% to 22% in 2016 and trending up. So I think that's right path with this strategy.	Ricardo Rittes	And Luca this is Ricardo. And also to add to what Bernardo just said the 25% was a number _ third quarter and 23% is the average number for the full-year as it has been growing from average of 14% in 2015 you could expect that the average for the year tends to be in growing pattern a little bit lower than the end of the year. I think that's - I think that might help you in your calculation. And _ specific to the guidance I mean when you look at historically _ and you are right _ prefer to give guidance number one on _ control and number two on things that we not allow _ competitive dynamic. I think those are two important criteria but if you go back to the _ I am hear with the guidance for the last seven years of the company we gave guidance on SG&A only _ seven years and prior to 20 - and I don't think we gave guidance at all. I think going back to our discussion that we had in the first question 2017 we decided that why _ provide a little bit of more qualitative guidance in the outlook session which might help you come to the conclusion some of those that you ask in the question we decided to limit the top-line and some of the like you said even CapEx and SG&A quantitative numbers provided.	Again I think that's --.	Luca Cipiccia	And maybe just to quantify on the SG&A, on the stated ambition to rebuild market share, what role do you think investments in the brands comparatively to last year will take. I think that's going to impact I think the line in particular is that you said you want to go back, you want to rebuild market share. I think there has been a positive trend, how much of that you think would come from investments in SG&A how much of that you think will be more sort of a price driven or mix driven strategy?	Ricardo Rittes	So, I mean just to provide you some assurances, there is not going to be anything different than what we have done in the past couple of years. So, we shouldn't expect any surprise. And I think when you look at market share for example, the only publicly available source to measure our market share in the full-year of 2016 is using as we thought we're distinguishing in December 13.	Therefore, we according to news, our market share was down below the range that we normally work to 66.2% in the average of the year. But as Bernardo pointed out in the growing trends, and it's important in terms of answer your question specifically about SG&A, that one of the cornerstones of our strategy the cost connect wind platform like we kept internally and even externally. And in this platform, I think control of cost and controlling expense is not a problem, is not something that is temporary here. It's a way of doing business and we try to be more efficient every year and every day on average everything that we do internal SG&A is not different.	Bernardo Paiva	And let me add to that Luca, these are our marketing and sales team, have been two kits to deal brands in a way that doesn't mean necessary more investment but way more efficient and the way more precise. That's what we have been doing in the last few years and then we applying this year as we speak.	Luca Cipiccia	Thank you. Thank you very much.	Bernardo Paiva	Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Antonio Gonzalez with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.	Antonio Gonzalez	Hi. Good morning Bernardo and Ricardo. Thank you, for taking my question. The first one is a follow-up on Luca's last question. I was also curious about the wording that you used in the outlook for 2017 with respect to market share in particular. I think you didn't use the market share metric in the last few years in terms of your guidance and I wanted to ask in light of the changes in the consolidation that is taking place in the industry. Do you think it makes sense to have a higher range for example and if so would you be willing to pursue market share even if it comes with lower EBITDA margin, I mean more EBITDA in nominal terms with lower EBITDA margin or that is not the case?	And then I have a very quick follow-up question afterwards.	Ricardo Rittes	Antonio, thank you for your question. So, I mean let me just clarify that. I think what we have done in the past 6% 7% 6% 9% is the optimal point in which us managing the complement to maximize value for the shareholders. I think that is the objective. Market share of course is a sustainable and long term way of getting there. And I think what we meant here in our Luca's section is the saying that we have always talked about.	We work on that on a range but from time-to-time we are up or down within that range. If you go back to five, six years ago, you see that we were like way ahead of the range that we set ourselves and then we used that over time. I think we have we wanted to put it there like our discomfort and being below the range and that using the same platform to cross-connecting and the commercial platforms we will work very hard to go back to the range as soon as possible.	Bernardo Paiva	And added to that, you see it's important to highlight that we started in 2017 as I explained in my speech with the market share increasing, I mean a post this trend, so just to add some flavor, we transform.	Antonio Gonzalez	Alright. And secondly if I may, the total distribution of decent plus IOC obviously this year was little bit lower compared to the previous 12 months and I obviously understand that we casted with a cash and duration that was lower this year, etcetera. And but I wanted to ask you get growth again and obviously working capital dynamics become more favorable as the company grows and I don't know CapEx will come back to let's say 2015 levels very rapidly or not but do you see room to increase this figure from the last 12 months and maybe even have a little bit more of an aggressive balance sheet structure or difficult to give some color on these specific number for the next 12 months or so?	Ricardo Rittes	Thank you for the question. I think just a couple of points there, during 2016, we turn approximately turn below as equity holders. Like you said that was a little bit lower than that of 2015. And our policy for some time has been to return excess cash to shareholders and have done that and if you go little bit back like -------	69 still the range? Or over the medium-term, I understand that 2017 has obviously be a little good. Over the medium-term, do you think it makes sense to have a higher range for example and if so would you be willing to pursue market share even if it comes with lower EBITDA margin, I mean more EBITDA in nominal terms with lower EBITDA margin or that is not the case?	And then I have a very quick follow-up question afterwards.	Ricardo Rittes	Antonio, thank you for your question. So, I mean let me just clarify that. I think what we have done in the past 6% 7% 6% 9% is the optimal point in which us managing the complement to maximize value for the shareholders. I think that is the objective. Market share of course is a sustainable and long term way of getting there. And I think what we meant here in our Luca's section is the saying that we have always talked about.	We work on that on a range but from time-to-time we are up or down within that range. If you go back to five, six years ago, you see that we were like way ahead of the range that we set ourselves and then we used that over time. I think we have we wanted to put it there like our discomfort and being below the range and that using the same platform to cross-connecting and the commercial platforms we will work very hard to go back to the range as soon as possible.	Bernardo Paiva	And added to that, you see it's important to highlight that we started in 2017 as I explained in my speech with the market share increasing, I mean a post this trend, so just to add some flavor, we transform.	Antonio Gonzalez	Alright. And secondly if I may, the total distribution of decent plus IOC obviously this year was little bit lower compared to the previous 12 months and I obviously understand that we casted with a cash and duration that was lower this year, etcetera. And but I wanted to ask you get growth again and obviously working capital dynamics become more favorable as the company grows and I don't know CapEx will come back to let's say 2015 levels very rapidly or not but do you see room to increase this figure from the last 12 months and maybe even have a little bit more of an aggressive balance sheet structure or difficult to give some color on these specific number for the next 12 months or so?	Ricardo Rittes	Thank you for the question. I think just a couple of points there, during 2016, we turn approximately turn below as equity holders. Like you said that was a little bit lower than that of 2015. And our policy for some time has been to return excess cash to shareholders and have done that and if you go little bit back like three, four, five years you see that our -- has more than doubled in that period. While you if you look at how the year progress or evolve over the course of 2016 has increased and why is that because when you look in terms of cash flow there is specifically a normal cash flow in the tax line in the first quarter and that's like we said in the first quarter results 2016 that was diluted overtime and so there is only shorter period of time that you look at that line the harder it is to reconcile but that impacted the full-year cash flow generation for the year when you analyze. Without giving any guidance in terms of pay out I think what you should expect what we have done in the past is that we doubt that impact you will get to that we use our strong cash flow generation which number one is reinvesting the organic growth of our business which we already discussed some of the use of cash for that purpose to invest in the organic growth of our business which we have already also some of the opportunities and then returned excess cash to our shareholders which we have been doing consistently over time so again that's as far as we can go to answer your question.	Operator	The next question comes from Lauren Torres with UBS. Please go ahead.	Lauren Torres	Yes. Hi everyone. I think you started the call mentioning that this was your most more challenging years in Brazil, but obviously you had volatile conditions before. I guess I am asking you to look at the past to predict the future and as we think about trends and the consumer hopefully stabilizing and coming back for maybe particularly in the second half of this year. I was just curious to get your perspective is there a lack of effect on returns are better here and softer in growth meaning the consumer may feel better but the categories that you participate in and take longer to kind of comeback just curious to get your perspective on that. Just is this more really 2018 event or just a easier comp feel better about year two, just general perspective would be great. Thank you.	Bernardo Paiva	Thanks Lauren. Thanks for the question. First let's understand quickly the 2016 again I mean three main drivers, The EBITDA the client, that we have I mean the first one is connect to the market here in Brazil so we know the economic activity I mean it was going down for the second is that through the year. If an unemployment rate in the higher rate recorded in years leading to the continuous decline for the income and decline in the industry. So second is that and the first quarter 2016 we have subject to the rate increase in some states putting additional pressure in our top-line and third one is really the temporary impact of the FX in our cash COGs as Ricardo explained.	So we have good earnings in 2016 but again we will do the main - last year we would do the same really looking for the long term investing to make sure that our business will be healthy for the long term. So I mean moving to 2017 I think four points are important to highlight. So one, which finds that the main market has [indiscernible] first inflation continues to decelerate.	GDP is expected to be flattish after two consecutive years of decline and employment will be increasing trend in the second. And fourth the income is likely to resume roads towards the end of the year. So it's good - better news for 2017 in the market form. Number two I mean the second semester of 2017 the FX impact in all COGs year-over-year, even becoming deflationary driver. And third is high in 2017 and not to be so significant as in 2016 as the most representative as the rate increase to from 19 to 20 to be effective much, much lower than previous year.	And fourth I mean have a strong plan. So not repeat my speech but I mean its important investment of our brands the innovation for brands and really make sure that they have the right execution in the market even better than they have now. We are also improving our primary and secondary packaging enhancing the brand's quality perception. So in all that is done shows that the new scope for significant increase the attributes of quality, and modernity and has also increased the consumer interest in purchasing the brand. Premier continues to be big so just remind us reference of premium brands already 30% way below the market share having been growing Budweiser leading the pack with the global more than 20% year-over-year gain in market share in leading year-over-year.	So you continue to be there have already explained about the RGBs in the right path and trade so growing in the right path and in the key brand of moments it will continue to be key because it's a way to drive volumes and build. So was a great example have been investing the high for eight years carnival that basically way with the generic created depth again supporting [indiscernible] street and have fun in the responsible way. So to continue to do that you see almost double or more than that and score was there. So it's important to connect the brand with the people we need, it's good for, it's good for the volume as well. And in other forms as well we will increase put the step up in our service level toward the point of sales that's good, that could be even better not to -- we have the ability in great execution that we need.	And then we go to the long long-term we continue to be bullish here in Brazil, on Brazil we know that's not the straight line up but every five years or so you have one or two years where things go sideways or backwards. That is the reality of emerging market. But there are few markets in the side and the growth drivers that we have in Brazil. So first demographics population continues to increase by 1.5% every year per capita despite considerable upward social mobility in the last 16 years and the consumption boost by the emerging class, but it is not given, our journey Brazil remains a country of different side one so opportunity for company here. And innovation is inside and different reality, in the country there are lot of opportunities for innovation driven by consumer trend, health and wellness, beer among other so we continue to be bullish in Brazil 2017 seems to be better year and we have strong very, very strong plan to tackle this opportunity.	Lauren Torres	That's very clear. I guess I was just trying to get a sense of there is a lack to meaning the consumer, but the beverage category takes a little bit more time but I think I understand your direction. If I can just ask one other thing then increase that we saw coming into last year and affecting you last year is there more threat toward success we should be thinking about this year?	Ricardo Rittes	Hello this is Ricardo. So just reminding every state has its own model, own tax rate and any state law that increases rate must be published in December 31 of the previous year and since we already have the visibility of the laws approved by the states we know that rate increases forced on 2017, and always more fraction of what we have seen in 2016 and we also know that the meaningful impact is the one that came from 19% to 20% rate to be effective as of March 31 like Bernardo already mentioned. That said I think what we can say also in terms of -- is that the cold beverage industry holds a permanent and constructing dialogue with each state government within showing that what we believe that a lower tax burden on the industry enables a greater potential for volume growth for the investment and as a result allow collection to continue to grow with no pressure inflation job creation investment. That's the model that we believe and I think what we see in terms of evolution of the behavior of some of these state is that migration towards that model that we believe.	Lauren Torres	Okay. Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.	Robert Ottenstein	Great. Thank you very much. Couple of questions. First earlier on the year one of your competitors started to peruse some fairly aggressive discounting. Can you give us any kind of update on whether that's continuing, or getting worse and I understand the conditions the competitive position conditions is always tough in Brazil but are you seeing things stabilize on that front?	Bernardo Paiva	Hi Robert, thank you for question. So it's very important to start with question like that but just what's obvious but very important to say that the Brazilian industry has always been very competitive and today is no different. There is no difference either way. What happened in 2016 we believe is not related to what more competitors doing but what is going on with Brazil. And with significant declining consumer possible income. We see this in our own business providing affordability in a profitable way with gaining a lot of in 2016 in spite of gaps that we still have and know a lot about represent 23% of the volumes in supermarket. On the other hand some value brands from competitors also benefited from the scenario sometimes line up possible way which explains some of the market share volatility that we have had. I think what's important to highlight is sequential net revenue per hectoliter increase which someone is in line what we have seen in the previous year which shows I will say that there is normal, if you will in the Brazilian market at the moment. I think that's as far as we can go Robert.	Robert Ottenstein	Understood and then possibly related I don't know if you can comment on it but I guess the [indiscernible] has been down now for a while. I understand it's going to be replaced are you seeing or sensing that competitors are they paying their taxes from what you can tell. Is that having any effect on the competitive dynamics?	Bernardo Paiva	So Robert I think first and foremost I think one of the most important thing is that government recognizes that it's very important for the industry to have an external monitoring system and so I think that has been said time and time again by the government. This new monitoring system needs time to be in place and I think the government is working to get that in place. In the short term you see no changes that for anyone to behave differently would be we have to be like a structural change and I think just of the government and the fact that the government is working to get the external monitor in place. I think it is enough to prevent people from structuring the change in their behavior. I think that is as far as we also can go but again we are - we also believe that's very important external monitoring system for the Brazilian industry.	Robert Ottenstein	Thank you very much. Appreciate it.	Operator	The next question comes from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.	Unidentified Analyst	Hi, good afternoon everyone. I mean I appreciate the whole conversation about not giving - not tipping off competitors etc, with a symmetric information etc. which is why I am little more confused now about why you stopped giving market share information on quarterly basis last year because obviously your competitors have that and you are not giving anything away because I mean I think when you told that 66.3 for the year based on the estimates I had for market share for earlier in the year it basically brings you to closer to 65 or something like that. And I appreciate your comment about it increasing already in 2017 but wouldn't it be a lot more helpful in the absence of more specific top-line guidance to substitute that with going back to releasing the market share information on a quarterly basis I think would help the market to that have the tools to do what you are not doing with guidance this year. So is it possible for you to tell us now what the first three quarters of the year were in terms of market share for beer Brazil?	Ricardo Rittes	Hi, this is Ricardo. I think first a couple of sources in terms of market share like we have said in the call I think their internal sources, their nuance and there are other source of market share. I think each of those sources they are very important for specific reasons but they are in nature very competitive as well so I think so has a variation of inventories and so the shorter the time that you look the harder it is for you to draw any conclusions. Trends are very important. However trends are very, very important. and we hear you when you say specifically given the fact that is no longer there for you guys to make your projections that it's gets harder for you to read and etc. but the only publicly available source to measure market share in the full-year that is the fact and we as a company we decided of the course of 2016 disclose all year in all the market share. We can go back and outside the call follow-up with you in order for you to give you the more color on how you could build your models with public availability information but in fact that at this point the company has decided not to provide quarterly info on market share.	Bernardo Paiva	The trends that the source show to us are the same. So that's what we can say to you and then again with start of the year I mean the market share increasing in a positive side. So.	Unidentified Analyst	So is it fair to say that in the fourth quarter of 2016 it did below the nine month number?	Bernardo Paiva	Yes we will provide the quarterly market share data.	Unidentified Analyst	Alright. Okay. We will take offline, thanks.	Bernardo Paiva	Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Alex Robart with Citi Group. Please go ahead.	Alex Robart	Yes hi, I want to go back to the market share number in Brazil beer and a couple of questions around that. The first one is when we think about the you reaching the 66 point with the 120 basis point loss in 12 months, is it I mean you suggest that this was mostly within the value segment I mean trading down kind of spurge demand in the value segment the response of RGBs 300 M.L. very effective in such during the year you have given us some numbers of how that's built up in the supermarket but is it fair to think about the 120 beeps of loss in beer market share as happening mostly in the value segment or any color that you could give us as to where that loss occurred during the year and the second part of the market share question so when we think about your strategy to rebuild you are pretty open about, that's the key priority this year and it also sounds like it's not going to be as expensive necessarily a big hockey stick molding SG&A you want to be more effective in that and might it be just perhaps possible to think about not going back to the 67 and 69 and thinking about maybe a lower market share range to get margins back quicker and this any color you can give us beyond what you have kind of hinted out or referred to as what do you think can be the pace of rebuilding that beer market share during the year. So a couple of questions around the market share. Thanks very much.	Bernardo Paiva	Thank you for question Alex. So I think you are absolutely right when you have economic situation like the one we have been living in Brazil for the last couple of years what you tend to see not only in our industry but overall in different consumer industries and even like automotive industry whatever is that you have premium and value suffering last proportionally to the main stream in this. As we are disproportional and again the main stream market for a proportionally more important when you compare to some of our competitors of course there is main stream first proportionately more into the environment like you pointed out yourself. And again that's the dynamic we have. But like you also said when we - when you move forward I think this is the segment benefited the most from the way so the single side represents a high up side for a recovery. And like you - like Bernardo said in his speech and like we put in our outlook session to develop that in a moment we are I think the word of cautiously optimistic about 2017 for exactly the same reason that made some of the previous year or like quarters like so difficult for the organization and I don't Bernardo if you again I think.	Yes. So again we do not have any follow-up questions but we see there is a lot of questions in the line but Alex even the last one today we will follow up with everyone that is in the line privately because we have already overcome our time by 12:30 minutes already so.	If you have a follow-up question Alex we can take from you and then Bernardo is going to do a …	Alex Robart	Yes. No. I mean so when we think about the rebuild right it's just kind of I mean do you think it's possible that it - that this recovery of market share occurs really in function of the economic improving or do you think that there can be something more company specific that can perhaps anticipate that and does it frankly make sense to keep the 67 to 69 range for this year. So that's kind of the follow-up on that.	Bernardo Paiva	So I mean your aggression to do a closing so I think that's why we think that 2017 Brazil specific be a better year. So again first one just to repeat the macro EBITDA and going down for the second half of the year growth towards the end of the year I mean just to give one, two examples on the macro side and this helps our business and helps our program because more and when disposed by income increase the more the benefit of that in our core brands means is the first point that's why we optimist in the industry. The second impacting our cost year-over-year decelerate. So was a big hit last year. And third tax the hikes for 2017 as I explained as Ricardo explained will not be so significant as it was in 2016. So the only exception that's a minor one happened last year. So the market we have two things that I - the facts and the taxes will help as well but the most important one we have a strong plan and that the economy I mean going back again that will help our core brand and we have boosting investment in our core business I have seen that could make a big difference for us. So I repeat we talk about new for the brand packaging enhancement that helps the quality perception of those brands.	In terms of core business stepping up our service level as well. It's will be there. The key in selling moments like we have done in carnival that not only but the brand as well a fully integrated market and sales plan. So that will help the core business and you get this positive trend I would say that's thing for disposal income and industry. So premium to be very important portfolio is amazing that we have and preference of premium brand is already 30% above the market share, brand of the market I mean that's Budweiser and it's very relevant. continue to help. not only RGBs but how we can really access I mean improve the shop experience in the stores some e-commerce initiatives as well and in just to repeat one thing the key brand selling moment will continue to be significant. So having said that I mean we think that 2017 we are pretty sure that we have much better year. We are confident in our plan. Our team is very, very inspired by the plan, very engaged on that so that's it. So we really think that first sign of the year January and February of the market share could tell us that this year we are on the right track.	Operator	The conference is now concluded.

14,Donaldson Co Inc. (NYSE:DCI),RIO,Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call,"March 01, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives	Brad Pogalz - Director, IR	Tod Carpenter - President and CEO	Scott Robinson - CFO	Analysts	Nathan Jones - Stifel	Brian Drab - William Blair	Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey	Matthew Paige - Gabelli & Company	Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird	Operator	Good morning. My name is Denise and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Donaldson’s Q2 Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.	Brad Pogalz, you may begin your conference.	Brad Pogalz	Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Donaldson’s fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Tod Carpenter, President and Chief Executive Officer and Scott Robinson, Chief Financial Officer.	This morning, Tod and Scott will walk through the details of our second quarter performance, the drivers of our increased guidance for fiscal 2017 and provide an update on some of our strategic initiatives. During today’s call, we may reference non-GAAP metrics such as adjusted earnings per share. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics within the schedules attached to this morning’s press release. Also, for reference, we posted a schedule on our Investor Relations website showing the year-over-year sales change with and without the impact from currency translation.	I want to remind everyone that any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our press release and SEC filings.	Now I will turn the call over to Tod Carpenter. Tod?	Tod Carpenter	Thanks Brad. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results we delivered during the first half of the fiscal year. We now expect to generate full year sales and profit above our original forecast. Scott will cover the guidance in more detail but the midpoints of our new ranges implies sales will be up 3% from last year and adjusted EPS will be up about 8%.	I want to thank our Donaldson employees for their contributions so far this year. They’ve done an excellent job executing our strategic priorities and meeting the needs of our customers. Everyday our employees around the world demonstrate the innovation, value and stability that Donaldson provides. I sincerely appreciate the commitment they have shown and their efforts are reflected in our strong performance.	In second quarter total revenue was $551 million, up 6.4% from last year in dollars and 7% in local currency. The strength in the quarter was entirely driven by the Engine segment which was up 13% as we compared against a very soft quarter last year. Within Engine there was clear evidence that our strategy to win innovative first fit programs and grow our replacement parts business is working.	In the quarter, we also saw some positive macro trends with restocking being the most notable. As an aside, I feel compelled to add a bit of restraint to the recent enthusiasm regarding market conditions. Beyond restocking the signs of stabilization are becoming more apparent; key measures like commodity prices, rig counts and industrial production all appear to be moving in the right direction. While these trends are encouraging there is still uncertainty relating to the timing of sustainable demand driven growth.	The mixed outlooks provided by our large customers reinforce the point that it is unlikely that we will see a meaningful turn prior to the end of our fiscal year in July. There is also lingering uncertainty related to policy changes and global economic conditions, which is underscored by the dramatic exchange rate fluctuations in recent months.	While our assessment may seem conservative, we believe a cautious stance is appropriate because it gives us flexibility to react to market changes. Turning back to the recap of engine sales strengthened aftermarket off-road and aerospace and defense, offset continued weakness in on-road.	Sales in on-road were down 28% from last year with the U.S. accounting for more than half of the decline as the production of Class 8 trucks remains depressed. Part of the decline is also attributable to the strong comp we had one year ago, which highlights the dramatic cyclicality inherent in U.S. truck production.	The off-road business reversed a multi-year decline during second quarter when it generated 10% sales increase. Additionally ordering patterns from our large customers continue to be stable. We did not see the typical calendar year-end demand fluctuations and sales were actually up from first quarter.	These trends reinforce our perspective that off-road is stabilizing, but it is still unclear as to whether we will see end market expansion in the near term. We were pleased with the aftermarket performance in the quarter, which jumped 20% from a historically low second quarter in fiscal 2016.	For the fourth quarter in a row both the OE and independent channels contributed to the year-over-year increase. There were several areas of strength in aftermarket last quarter. The OE channel benefited from restocking, while the growing rig count helped the independent channel. Beyond these market driven tailwinds, we are seeing benefits from executing our strategy.	First, we continued to gain traction from winning new programs to provide OE service parts, for example liquid sales were up more than 20% last quarter as a result of this new service part program. Additionally PowerCore remains a strong contributor to overall success as aftermarket sales of this product were up more than 30% last quarter.	Finally, Partmo generated sales of $4 million in the quarter, which contributed about 1.5% to total aftermarket growth. As we said at the beginning of the year, our focus is on growing replacement part sales and our first half performance is evidence of the success we have had.	Rounding of the engine discussion, sales of aerospace and defense grew 10% last quarter as we saw strength in the commercial and defense businesses. Within commercial, the strength has been coming from fixed wing aircraft, as we are gaining traction with our cabin air system.	The Industrial segment was under pressure last quarter with total sales down 4% as currency translation and year-over-year declines in both gas turbine systems and special applications were only partially offset by growth in industrial filtration solutions. Total IFS sales grew 6% last quarter or 7.5% in local currency.	We were pleased with the strong replacement part sales, while first fit remains under pressure. On the positive side, quoting activity is increasing in most geographies as current and potential customers respond to our offering, including our LifeTec filters and Downflo Evolution. Within the quarter sales of Downflo Evolution or DFE more than doubled as we continue to expand outside the U.S.	The gas turbine business continues to face pressure from an increasingly competitive market. The 36% sales decline was led by a sharp drop in large turbine projects, reflecting a combination of our strategic shift to bid these projects more selectively and customer delays. We expected a sales decline from executing our strategy, but project delays in the Middle East and other regions speak to the volatility in this business. Finally, special application sales declined about 8% last quarter, primarily driven by membrane and disk drives.	I will now turn the call over to Scott, for a recap of our second quarter performance and full year outlook. Scott?	Scott Robinson	Thanks, Tod. Good morning everyone. We are pleased with the quarter, as we converted a 6.4% sales increase in second quarter to a sharp increase in net earnings, as we saw better absorption and expense leverage. Our Q2 EPS of $0.35 was up 25% from last year on a GAAP basis and 20.7% when compared with last years adjusted EPS. As a reminder, the prior GAAP metrics included about $1 million of one-time charges. These items reduced second quarter 2016 GAAP EPS by $0.01 and operating margin by about 30 basis points.	Our second quarter 2017 operating margin grew to 12.6% from last year's GAAP and adjusted rates of 10.4% and 10.7% respectively. The improvement from last year split fairly evenly between gross margin and operating expense. Higher fixed cost absorption drove the gross margin up to 34.1% while the expense ratio of 21.5% reflects leverage on the sales volume that was partially offset by a headwind from incentive compensation.	Our effective tax rate in the quarter increased to 29.8% from 23.0% in 2016. The prior rate was artificially low due to retroactive benefits from the FAST [ph] tax act and other discrete items. Additionally the mix of earnings lowered the rate last year and pushed this year's rate up. We continue to manage our balance sheet with discipline. We ended the quarter with a gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of about 1.5 times, right in line with our long-term targets.	Compared with last year, receivables are up slightly and inventory is down more than 5%. We are pleased with how we have kept working capital in check, while managing the sales increase.	During the second quarter, we returned $23 million to our shareholders through dividends and invested another $10.5 million to repurchase 0.2% of our outstanding shares. So far this year, we have repurchased about 1% of our outstanding shares. Including CapEx of $13 million and reflective of our efforts to optimize working capital cash conversion in the quarter was a robust 112%.	Of course the location of cash continues to be a hard topic. So I'll remind you that nearly all of our cash is outside the U.S. Another hard topic is overall tax reform. So I wanted to quickly address a question that many of you have asked. At Donaldson, the U.S. is a net exporter.	In fiscal 2016, Donaldson U.S. exports totaled roughly $200 million, while imports into the U.S. were less than half that amount. So we’re talking about small dollars here relative to cost of goods sold, driven in large part by our decade old strategy to build our region to support region production model. We always continue [ph] the full economic impact of production decisions, so our approach will continue to be guided by the interest of our customers and shareholders.	Turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook, we now plan to exceed our original forecast for full year sales, operating profit and EPS. I want to underscore a point Tod made though. There are still of lot of unanswered questions, related to the timing and magnitude of a market recovery. While recent trends are undeniably positive, we feel strongly that maintaining the cautious stance is the most prudent approach for keeping our expenses, inventory and other investments in line.	We have reflected this balance in our guidance, which includes some puts and takes within the business that yield and adjusted EPS forecast between a $1.60 and a $1.68. The midpoint of this range is 8% above last year and $0.06 above the midpoint of our prior guidance. We continue to expect GAAP EPS will be $0.05 above adjusted EPS, as a result of the Northern Technical escrow settlement from earlier this year.	On the top line, total sales are forecasted to increase between 2% and 4% from last year, compared with prior guidance of plus or minus 2%. Included within this forecast is a headwind for currency translation of about 1%.	The Engine segment is driving all of the upside in our sales forecast with notable strength in off-road and aftermarket. Our third-party estimates for heavy-duty equipment production are still depressed with ag and mining declines in the mid-to-high single digit range and construction flat to down slightly. We've seen our off-load business pick up. We now expect full year sales will increase in the mid-single digit range reflecting the first full year sales increase in this business since mining's peak in 2012.	Aftermarket sales accelerated in the second quarter and we're forecasting the trend to continue through the balance of this fiscal year. The factors Todd mentioned like restocking and the pickup from oil and gas are compounded by benefits from our innovative product and the short cycle wins we've had in the liquid business.	Including the benefit of $12 million to $13 million from the Partmo acquisition we now forecast aftermarket sales will increase in the high-single to low-double digit range which is well above our forecast for flat overall market utilization. We also fine-tuned the forecast for on-road and aerospace and defense. Sales of AMD [ph] are now forecast to be up in the low single digit range while on-road sales will be down from last year in the high-teens.	Specific to on-road the downward revision reflects slightly more pressure in the US and a modest softening elsewhere in the world. Altogether engine sales are now forecast to increase between 5% and 7% from last year compared with the prior guidance for sales to be roughly flat.	On the other side we expect industrial segments sales will be below our initial guidance. Total industrial sales are forecast to decline between 1% and 3% from last year which includes an impact from currency translation of about 1.5% and lower projections for both GTS and special applications. There are no notable market changes contributing to this update in special applications. We sharpened our pencils [ph] for the back half of the year and now see sales being down in the mid-single digit range. The GTS business however is facing increased pressure from the inherent lumpiness of large turbine projects.	We now expect sales will decline in the mid-teens with the guidance revision driven primarily by project delays. The decline in GTS and special applications are being partially offset by a lower single-digit increase in industrial filtration solutions which is consistent with our prior forecast.	Our fiscal '17 operating margin is now expected to between 13.7% and 14.3%. The midpoint of this range is up 40 basis points from our prior guidance and 80 basis points from last year's adjusted rate.	Included within the full year forecast are benefits from restructuring that we did in 2016 which totaled about $12 million and the headwind from compensation expense. In light of the updated sales and profit forecast we now expect another $8 million to $10 million of incentive comp this year bringing the total year-over-year headwind to somewhere between $28 million and $30 million.	Another less precise headwind is coming in gross margin as we invest in staffing and premium freight to meet our high service level commitments in the face of increased demand. It's a welcome problem but these charges do affect the amount of incremental profit we deliver. As a reminder, our rate of incremental profit can fluctuate given a variety of factors including the pace of change and the mix of business. Additionally, with fixed expenses accounting for 15% to 20% of cost of goods sold and more than two thirds of operating expense the incremental rate can vary widely.	We wrap our perspective on all these things in our full year guidance which does demonstrate our ability to generate incremental profit on a stable sales base. Further down the income statement we still expect other income between $15 million and $17 million and our full year tax rate is now expected to be 27.1% to 29.1%.	In terms of capital deployment, we lowered our full year CapEx forecast to between $60 million and $70 million and we still expect to repurchase between 2% and 3% of outstanding shares. We plan to generate free cash flow of $240 million to $260 million and expect cash conversion between 105% and 115%.	Now I want to offer some color on the back half of fiscal '17. Compared to the first half our guidance implies strong sequential improvements in sales and operating profit. We also expect to see a bigger step up from the second to the third quarter than we do from Q3 to Q4. Please keep in mind that the comps in the second half are much tougher than the first, so the year-over-year improvement will also be more modest.	We have plans in place to leverage and momentum we have seen in the business but we are also focused on the long-term. A notable example, and one that I am particularly passionate about is our global ERP. We closed the quarterly books in the system for the second time now, and I can confidently say that we are gaining a deeper understanding of our business and processes every day. I’m also confident that in that our efforts surrounding the global ERP are part of a journey that will take years.	I see a large pipeline of projects to help us increase efficiency, get smarter about ourselves and our customers and take costs out of the business in a thoughtful matter. I am very pleased by the progress to date and look forward to continuing this journey.	With that, I’ll turn the call back to Tod.	Tod Carpenter	Thanks Scott. To summarize our sentiment we are encouraged by overall end market conditions but not yet confident that sustainable market growth is right on the horizon. We are however confident in our strategic priorities and our ability to maintain our focus on those things that are within our control. More specifically we continue to act with the future in mind. Our sales teams are in this field building and deepening our customer relationships while our engineers are developing new and innovated filtration techniques and products.	The combination of their efforts is perfectly aligned with our strategy, win new innovative first-fit business to drive sales of replacement parts. Over the past few year our customers have become increasingly interested in signing longer-term supply agreements with us because they see how our strategy creates value for them. We used to discuss two or three year contracts but now we are talking about arrangements that can last up to 10 years resulting in strong customer relationships.	The strategy begins with the innovative first-fit wins and we continue to be pleased with the in-roads we are making. Our win rates for new programs are at or above historical levels. Importantly a large portion of those wins are incremental business for Donaldson and we have a big pipeline of new opportunities.	In liquid for example, first-fit wins with our innovative Synteq XP media are starting to show up in revenue. This product effectively addresses challenges created by high fuel injector pressure and increasing use of low sulfur and bio-diesel. Although the dollars are still small our Select Fuel business which leverages Synteq XP media has increased by nearly 50% so far this year.	We are also excited about the progress with down flow evolution in the industrial segment. As I mentioned early in the call, sales of these dust collectors more than doubled in the quarter. Customers continue to respond to DFE's value proposition and the innovative technology will drive our replacement part sales.	We also see geographic growth opportunities with this product. We launched in the U.S. in 2015 and began selling worldwide in fiscal 2016. One year ago international DFE sales where only about 10% of the total. So far this year they have grown to nearly 25% of the total while sales in the U.S. are also growing.	Another area of strength is the progress we have made to grow our replacement part sales across the company. Year-to-date replacement parts account for more than 60% of total revenue and sales of these products is up in the low double-digit range. We’re seeing growth in both segments and in geographies around the world, which reflects our robust selling and distribution model. We are also investing in our future by developing an ecommerce capability. A comparative advantage of Donaldson has been making it easy for customers to do business with us and ecommerce is another way we are going to reinforce that advantage.	We expect to launch the site for selected businesses during fiscal 2018. So there is still some work to be done, but we are making good progress. These are just a few examples of how we are delivering against our strategic priorities. We are confident that our continued strong execution will position us to deliver on our strategic and financial commitments for the balance of this year and in to the future.	Now, I’ll turn the call back to Denise to open the line for questions. Denise.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.	Nathan Jones	Good morning, Tod, Scott, Brad.	Tod Carpenter	Good Morning.	Nathan Jones	I wonder if we could just start a little bit in the Engine business there, clearly strong sales, clearly a big increase in your forecast for the year. Could you give us a little bit more color on what you think is fundamental market improvement there versus customer restocking and maybe how long you think that restock could last?	Tod Carpenter	Sure, this is Tod. Relative to restocking and where we are in the cycle of restocking it’s really tough to say. What we have seen clearly is good execution and share gain. We’ve seen restocking. As far as the third component end market increase, really unclear at this time. On the restocking I want to remind you that our sales on the independent channel are roughly 60% of our aftermarket and our OES channel is 40% and you’ll see less of a restocking phenomenon in the independent channel than you will on the OES and we are seeing it on the OES. So where we are within that particular cycle of restocking, it’s not sure, we’re not sure.	Nathan Jones	Historically could you give us some color on maybe an average length of the restocking cycle, just give us some kind of idea of maybe how long to expect on that?	Tod Carpenter	Again it’s just unclear, we’re looking at what happened in this quarter as an acute event. And really we kind of shrug that off, we take care of our customers. We’re really focused on them make sure that our delivery rates are where they need us to be in order to strengthen our long term relationships, but as far as the longevity of the restocking it’s really tough to say.	Nathan Jones	Okay, fair enough.	Brad Pogalz	Nathan, this is Brad. One point I’d add on the historic side, just to give you a context when things were going the other way a couple of years ago we were talking about the old rules of thumb on destocking where typically one to two quarters, and then it ended up being 4, 5, 5.5, 6 quarters where we saw more aggressive destocking. So I think part of what’s happened in the market in the last couple of years is some of those old paradigms have changed as well which clearly adds to the uncertainty.	Nathan Jones	Okay, understood and then just a follow up question on the mining market. I think you said you’re still expecting that to be down mid-single digits this year. I know that does drive some outsize off the market in that. I think people are starting to get more positive on the mining market. Can you talk about what you’re seeing there and what the expectations are going forward, maybe added to 2018 if you have any ideas there?	Tod Carpenter	Sure, I think what you see are articles about the actual mining operators and producers like the Rio Tintos of the world coming out a little more positive on their balance sheet recovery et cetera, and so that’s getting people more positive about the mining sector. But for us it’s really about vehicle utilization and overall quantities of that product, that’s been shipped. And so we continue to look for vehicle utilization.	You are looking at highly dependent, look forward in highly dependent mining based economies like Australia, South Africa et cetera. And then it’s still a little modest out there and mixed. So we did not change our projections on mining as a direct result of lack of clarity.	Nathan Jones	Have you seen any directional change there at all?	Tod Carpenter	No.	Nathan Jones	Okay, thanks very much for the help.	Operator	Your next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.	Brian Drab	Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my questions.	Tod Carpenter	Good morning.	Brian Drab	Good morning. First, just on I guess a little bit more on the restocking, I'm looking at the aftermarket forecast and just looking at first half of fiscal ’17 versus second half of fiscal ’17 and the guidance that you just gave us, where I think you said up high single-digits to low double-digits for the year. And that would put aftermarket up about 8% in the second half of ’17 versus the first half and that seems sort of like just typical seasonality and I'm just wondering if you can comment, does that increase second half over first half in your mind and your model contemplate just typical seasonality or is there continued restocking and is there I guess potentially upside to that number if we see continued restocking?	Tod Carpenter	Brian, I think you’ve analyzed that correct. We would look for the normal seasonality. We built that within our guidance here and that's the way we really look at the aftermarket activity. We see -- we really don't know where we are in this restocking channel if you will, in cycle and so consequently we're really a bit more business as usual on the predictability of things and that's what you're interpreting in the guidance. So I think that's fine.	Brian Drab	Okay. Thanks and then I guess, related to predictability and visibility, I'm not sure if this is a great question, because I know you many, many data points that you look at to solve the market and competitive landscape. But does that acquisition of CLARCOR in anyway takeaway meaningful important indicator data points that you had -- I mean that you previously tracked to keep an eye on the market in the competitive landscape?	Tod Carpenter	As far as the way we view the market and the way that we overall forecast the market, it does not, right. Obviously, it takes away just a data point of competitive analysis of how we're doing as compared to a competitive, but as far as the macro trends and how we operate Donaldson company and what we look for within our forecasting, it doesn't change anything.	Brian Drab	All right, great and then last one from me, you mentioned the SynTech Product again and that the dollars are still small, but I wonder if you can tell us a little bit more about which products and markets are driving the great growth in liquid filtration and are you taking share there and if you could tell us what percent of total sales, liquid sales account for today given, it sounds like you're seeing great growth in that -- with that product line?	Tod Carpenter	Sure, Brian. The overall share gain that we're experiencing is in fuel. We've been talking to you about fuel and our competitive advantage with some of our innovative technologies that we created over the last three, four, five years and you're starting to see that come forward. We've highlighted that story for quite some time and you're really now seeing that come into production. So we would look to build on that, based upon the share, the clear share gains that we have had in that segment and so it's really fuel driven.	Brad Pogalz	Brian, this is Brad. I'll give you the stats on it. liquid is about a third of total engine and the fuel lube business Tod is talking about is a little more than half of that.	Brian Drab	Okay. And liquid as a percent of total sales today, and maybe compared to what it was a year or two ago?	Brad Pogalz	I have to do the math, it's again about a third of total engine, but where it was…	Brian Drab	Okay, and that's all -- that's the only place that we have liquid and so you are saying it's all in engine, right, right. So okay.	Brad Pogalz	So liquid in total this year is up in the low teens, so versus a year ago we're – we continue to do quite well in this business.	Brian Drab	Great. Okay.	Tod Carpenter	Yes, yeah in the industrial segment, Brian, you see us going after liquid with things like our LifeTec products and other. So you will see our liquid based strategy really starting to go over to the industrial side as well in quarters to come.	Brian Drab	Okay. All right, great, thank you.	Tod Carpenter	Thanks Brian.	Operator	Your next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.	Charles Brady	Hey thanks, good morning guys.	Tod Carpenter	Good morning, Charlie.	Charles Brady	I wanted to dig into a little bit more on the off-road piece of engine. I mean clearly was -- you've touched on a little bit, but I guess I'd just like to a get a little more deeper in granularity into kind of where you're seeing on that, and you talked about some of the restocking but that sounds more like an aftermarket phenomenon then on OE side. I'm just trying to understand the strength on the off-road business from an OE perspective, it just seems a little stronger than we would have thought it would have been to coming into this quarter?	Tod Carpenter	Charlie this is Tod. It's actually stronger than we have predicted in our models as well. And I think the primary comp when you go year-to-year is last year we had year-end shutdowns and extended year-end shutdowns as it was a pretty difficult moment, and you saw across all sectors of the off-road really managing finished goods inventories, and therefore producing less.	We did not see those extended shutdowns this year. So in a way it's kind of early easy comps year-over-year but really what carries that strength is less shutdowns across all sectors ag, construction and mining.	Charles Brady	Okay. That's helpful understanding that, so I guess I would take from that then, I you alluded to it going into the second half, you don’t really have that same phenomenon. So the rate of increase may be stronger than it was otherwise going to be we thought. But you’re not going to get the similar types of surprising pop to the upside in the second half just because you don’t have the similar phenomenon on shutdown comp, is that correct?	Tod Carpenter	That’s correct. That’s the way we view it and that analysis is what we built in guidance.	Charles Brady	Okay. And just on the gas turbine business, on the order delays, it sounds that that's pushed into 2018, is it in fact order delays or you are seeing things may be being pushed out, when you are saying delayed, delayed to date unknown type of delay as opposed to six, eight month type of timeframe.	Tod Carpenter	Two types of delays. So we’ve seen projects that are in hand move out of this fiscal into next fiscal year. But we’ve also seen quotes that were expected to be awarded move out much further as well.	Charles Brady	Okay, thank you. That’s helpful, thanks.	Operator	Your next question comes from Matthew Paige with Gabelli and company. Your line is open.	Matthew Paige	Good morning everybody. Just wanted to touch on some points, kind of what you brought up earlier. Have you evaluated, what kind of impact you would see from the administration's tax proposals?	Tod Carpenter	Yeah, I mean we’ve been following that closely. I mean, I provided a little bit of additional information this quarter to discuss, the fact that Donaldson is a net exporter, out of the U.S. So we feel like we’re well positioned there. I am also indicated that our of our cash sits outside of the U.S. so any sort of repatriation changes, we would love to take advantage of. And you know obviously a lower corporate tax rate would help our company.	So we feel like we sit in a strong position, in relation to the various tax changes that have been considered and we continue to monitor that every day.	Matthew Paige	Great. And then how do you view a potential boost in infrastructure spending effecting Donaldson's products in your end market	Tod Carpenter	We are really pleased that the administration is taking look at boosting infrastructure spending. However that would not affect our fiscal ’17 typically, as I want to remind you that we’d end in -- our fiscal year ends July 31st. So any infrastructure spending boost by the time it would roll through the overall end market, would likely be in future fiscal years.	Matthew Paige	Got it. And then the last question from me is obviously on road class 8 has been under pressure, but seeing some signs of life in envisioned orders. Could you may be provide some color on how your conversations with customers there have gone?	Tod Carpenter	I think it’s really just more bouncing along at the current levels and everybody trying to understand when the U.S. base market which has really driven so much of the headwinds here, when that U.S. market will start to see a turn. We are really with all of our on-road OE's more fixated on winning future business and winning new platforms than any kind of euphoria about end market turn around.	Brad Pogalz	Matthew this is Brad, one thing I would add is just looking at ACT data I guess from our point of view the other positive that’s varied in some of this declines is that, the forecast as they’ve been moving through the year are coming down at a less dramatic pace. I think a year ago the quarterly forecast from -- were moving down by 10% or 15% or 20% each quarter from what they thought, just 90 days ago. And now that seems to a stabilized. Still declining production but at least the forecast seemed to have a better handle on it.	Matthew Paige	Great. Thanks for the time.	Tod Carpenter	Thank you.	Operator	Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.	Richard Eastman	Yes. Good morning and congrats on the nice surprise, nice quarter. I am sure you’ve breathed a little bit sign of relief here. I have just a quick question, when I look at the geographic growth rates, kind of by segment engine and industrial what maybe strikes me a little bit here is EMEA and the strength in EMEA across the board. Is did -- from a geographic stand point was EMEA the biggest may be surprised to you and is there a macro perspective that you could overlay on to what amounted to 10% growth rate, local currency	Tod Carpenter	No, I don’t think EMEA really surprised. If you take a look at our previous calls I have been talking about the gains we have been making in our after-market strategy and pressing forward with our replacement parts businesses across EMEA and they have been executing very well on those strategies for some time and to a larger extent that really just a microcosm of our comprehensive plan for the year, which is grow replacement parts to offset the headwinds we should experience in the first fit, and really all segments all regions in the company are performing quite well there.	So the things that I would suggest about EMEA is that throughout all of this it's held up in the core base businesses a bit stronger than for example the U.S. region cycled down much heavier and there was a less of a drop in Europe. So I think overall we’re pretty proud of the execution across our European organization.	Richard Eastman	I understand. And then just a quick question as well. Do you have any visibility, when you look at the aftermarket business and the nice kind of bounce there, do you have any visibility into the sell-through in that channel versus your sell-in this quarter?	Tod Carpenter	We don’t Rick, and that’s what really creates the difficultly for us to predict where we are in any kind of an acute event like a restocking.	Richard Eastman	Okay, and then just maybe last question. Really good incremental EBIT leverage in the quarter and obviously we’re surprised here with the restock and just the acceleration here and the upside in the revenue. As we go -- as we push forward over the next, call it 12 months so we capture the first half of next year, should we expect that incremental to settle down more in the 25 to 30 range or, how do you think about that, because you obviously do reinvest if you feel there is some sustainability in the revenue top line. So should that be the way we’re thinking about the incremental here moving forward?	Scott Robinson	Hi, Rick, this is Scott. So I mean we were pleased with the incremental improvement we delivered in the first half. We did have a pretty good lift in sales. We have taken our guidance up a little bit on increased sales for the last half of the year. So we are comfortable with the current guidance and as we have always said, we believe that we can slowly improve our profit on increasing sales and that something we’re going to work on everyday.	We do have some headwinds coming this quarter, as I mentioned, we have some variable comp that we’re going to have to absorb. We do have some additional margin costs associated with suddenly increase in demand that being freight you know and maybe some additional cost in the plant that we have to manage. But at the end of the day we believe we can slowly increase incremental margins on improving sales.	Richard Eastman	And is there any issue, Scott, or any concern around any materials inflation, materials cost inflation at the cost to goods sold end?	Scott Robinson	Yeah, there is certainly some inflation coming. We monitor our commodity prices every day and they are providing a little bit of a headwind going forward. We work to mitigate that, but that’s something that we are aware of.	Richard Eastman	Okay, okay, very good and thank you and congrats again, nice quarter.	Scott Robinson	Thank you.	Operator	Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.	Unidentified Analyst	Hi, good morning this is Dennis on for Lauren. You mentioned that Ag was going to be down mid-single digits, could you provide some color what you are seeing there, I mean are trough conditions forming or is it just not showing any signs of firming up, just any insight?	Tod Carpenter	Sorry, what was the last part Den. Not sure we got your whole question. Could you please repeat that?	Unidentified Analyst	Sure, I think you indicated that Ag was down mid-single digits. I was wondering if any if trough conditions are starting to form, if there is any signs of strength at all?	Tod Carpenter	Within Ag, I think you see Deer for example they took up their latest forecast and so they gave, they signaled some positivity out there. So we do hear those kind of data points and we -- but we did take that into account, because it's as you look outside the U.S. it’s a little bit more of a troubled story with other large based customers. So overall there is clearly mixed signals across the Ag market, and there is just not clarity. And so we just did not feel comfortable altering where we currently stand on ag as we don't see it in our backlogs and we don't really translate that obviously therefore into revenue.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. And then the cost you removed through last year's restructuring or 2016 restructuring, is there any chance both cost could seep back in as some of -- as things kind of accelerate or some of your end markets accelerate?	Tod Carpenter	Sure. We said there was $12 million of benefit coming into this year. Those are structural cost. I would say that we worked to take out. Sales continue to accelerate. We are certainly going to have to address our expense levels. And some of our expenses are fixed, others are variable. But in general I think if revenues are way up then our expenses are going to have to address that. We're cautious in adding infrastructure. So we're very careful about adding in. but we will continue to invest in the future of the company on sales increases.	Unidentified Analyst	Okay. and then finally, with your e-commerce efforts, that's coming online in the next year or I think you said 2016. Is using e-commerce unusual for the industry? Is that something Donaldson (phon) would have ever looked to before? I was just wondering what the dynamics look like.	Tod Carpenter	It's not unusual but for Donaldson it represents a new channel just simply because we're very inconsistent in its usage. Today you could order an e-commerce part in some of our businesses in some of the regions. But you can't order a part over the internet from Donaldson everywhere in the world. And that's the thing we're out to change. There will be multiple models of e-commerce, the engine model for aftermarket because we are distribution based partnership model.	We'll keep that intact but there are other businesses also that will have an direct end-market model because that's the way we run that business. And so we are building in the flexibility necessary to arm all of our businesses to really use this e-commerce channel as a positive for growth.	Unidentified Analyst	Great, thank you very much.	Operator	There are no further questions at this time I turn the call back over to Brad Pogalz.	Brad Pogalz	That concludes today's call. I want to thank everyone for listening for their time and interest in Donaldson. I also want thank our employees again. I'm very appreciative with their efforts and because of them I am confident that we can deliver our strategic and financial commitments. Have a good day. Good bye.

15,Start Time: 10:00,RIO,End Time: 10:56,Belmond Ltd. (NYSE:BEL),"Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call	February 28, 2017, 10:00 AM ET	Executives	Roeland Vos - President and CEO	Martin O’Grady - EVP and CFO	Amy Brandt - VP, Corporate Finance and IR	Analysts	David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group	Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital	Howard Bryerman - PENN Capital Management	Operator	Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to today’s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call for Belmond Ltd. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I must advise you this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 28, 2017.	Now without any further delay, I’d like to hand the conference over to Amy Brandt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Amy, over to you.	Amy Brandt	Thank you, Erica. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call for Belmond Ltd. We issued our earnings release last night. The release is available on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.belmond.com, as well as on the SEC Web site.	On the call with me today are Roeland Vos, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martin O’Grady, Chief Financial Officer.	Before we get started today, I would like to readout our usual cautionary statement under the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In the course of our remarks to you today by Belmond’s management and in answering your questions, they may make forward-looking statements concerning Belmond such as its earnings outlook, its three-point growth strategy including future investment plans and other matters that are not historic facts and therefore involve risks and uncertainties.	We caution that actual results of Belmond may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause actual results to differ is set out in yesterday’s news release, the company’s latest annual report to shareholders and the filings of the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.	Management will be using certain non-GAAP financial measures today to analyze the fourth quarter and full year operating performance of the company. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the earnings release we issued last night.	I will now hand the call over to Roeland.	Roeland Vos	Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. We’re pleased to have you joining us for a discussion on our fourth quarter and our full year 2016 results, as well as for an outlook for 2017. 2016 was an important year for Belmond for a multitude of reasons. In June, we unveiled our long-term strategic plan laying out an ambitious goal to double the size of the company by the year 2020.	Over the course of the year and into 2017, we started to lay the foundation for all of the building blocks that are needed to accelerate the growth of the company; welcoming new people, beginning to implement the systems and the initiatives to help us execute on that plan.	And at the same time, we maintained a disciplined focus on our operating results delivering 8% constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth for the full year of 2016, which is in line with the organic growth CAGRs that we provided you with in our June presentation.	I’m pleased with how much we have accomplished in the first year of our strategic plan and I’m looking forward to 2017, which I expect will be another year of strong growth and particularly meaningful in the context of making headway towards our 2020 goals.	On today’s call, I will first speak briefly about our 2016 results, on our full year 2017 guidance and will then provide an update on some of the programs that we’ve made on our strategic plan. Martin will follow with the details of the fourth quarter and full year results and take you through the specifics of our RevPAR guidance.	Now before I begin, please note that all of the year-over-year variances that I’ll provide you with will be on a constant currency basis.	As you will have seen in our earnings release, our full year same-store RevPAR growth was 3% over 2015. Revenue also increased to 2% over prior year and as I just mentioned, total adjusted EBITDA was up 8% taking full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA to just north of $120 million.	You will recall that in our June Investor Presentation, we provided you with five-year CAGRs for our growth from the existing properties and that was 3% to 5% for RevPAR, 2% to 5% for revenue and 7.5% to 9.5% for adjusted EBITDA. Now you can see that our full year results fit clearly well within the bounds of each of these long-term metrics.	So with that, I’m pleased with this year’s growth which reflected our focus on delivering strong results during the high demand period, such as The Olympics and the European peak summer season, while at the same time working closely with the properties that are dealing with some more challenging operating environments where we did our best to mitigate the year-over-year declines.	Looking forward, we expect 2017 to be another year of growth. We provide same-store full year RevPAR guidance of 1% to 5% growth and you will note that this guidance is negatively impacted by the comparison to the Olympic year in Brazil. The impact of the Belmond Copacabana Palace on its own is 4 percentage points to our own year-over-year growth. That means that if we took this hotel out of the equation for both years’ comparisons, our RevPAR guidance would be 5% to 9% growth. That is certainly solid.	Now in light of this expected strong growth for the full year, it’s very important to highlight that we currently expect that our seasonal small first quarter which typically generates less than 5% of our annual adjusted EBITDA will be a challenging one. This will be made even more apparent in the year-over-year comparisons for our first quarter 2016, which was particularly strong.	At a high level, to our first quarter of 2017 we are seeing headwinds in Brazil, the Caribbean and for our trains and cruises. We see strength in places like Cape Town and in Charleston. I will note that many of the challenges that we’re seeing in year-over-year growth are largely isolated to the first quarter and the balance of the year is looking promising at this point in time and supports the full year guidance that I just provided to you.	I would now like to reflect on how we have been performing in the three key areas of this strategic plan, which as a reminder are driving top-line growth and bottom-line results, increasing brand awareness and expanding our global footprint. With regards to the first strategic growth pillar, organic growth, our focus in 2016 was on our four key areas for operating initiatives which were structure, resources, systems and product.	In terms of structure, we started the year by reviewing our organization to make sure that we’re operating as seamless as a fully integrated enterprise that supported our hotels and our businesses.	Looking at our sales and marketing department, we identified that having our sales and revenue management teams reporting into our Head of Marketing was causing us to miss some obvious synergies with the operations.	We changed this structure early in the year such that all of the revenue-related functions are now reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Philippe Cassis. Philippe has a primary responsibility to drive the performance of our properties and it’s only logical that he oversees all of the teams in charge of driving revenue.	In terms of resources, having the right people in place and keeping them focused and motivated is fundamental to driving revenue and profit. We made great strides in engaging our employees to feel connected to the company, to feel connected to the brand so that our frontline employees deliver the best experience to our customers. Delivering that most exceptional personalized experience to our guests is on way that we differentiate ourselves from the rest of our competition in the luxury space.	We recently strengthened our regional leadership with the appointment of Robert Koren to Vice President of Southern Europe, a position which includes oversight of our key Italian assets. Robert brings over 30 years of solid industry experience, most recently serving as Starwood’s Vice President, Regional Director for Southern Europe where he was responsible for more than 60 luxury hotels. We’re excited to have Robert onboard and we believe that with his background that he will do a fantastic job in managing some of the world’s most well-known luxury properties.	It’s also essential for our people to know where we’re planning to take the company and how we intend to get there. We educated the entire organization on the strategic plan and aligned everyone’s focus on achieving the plan in order to get buy-in across the board from all those people who will be instrumental in our success.	Then on the systems front, you have heard me speak about creating a new digital ecosystem starting with our CRM. Having a more modern fully functional CRM for us is vital to be able to engage more effectively with our customers. And to be able to recognize them when they are at our properties and even before they arrive.	Our current CRM lacks the features to achieve these goals and as such we identified that we need to replace the CRM and we commenced an implementation program midway through 2016. We intend to go live with the CRM early in the second quarter of 2017 and expect that this new system will allow us to have better relationships with our customer thus translating into greater revenue opportunities as well.	Likewise, we believe that there are tremendous opportunities with our Web site. Our current site is outdated and having it fragmented. I’ve been speaking about this a number of times before. Completing rebuilding the Web site is a long process, so in the meantime we’ve executed on 10 identified areas for optimization of our existing site, all of which have been completed.	The improvements that we have seen thus far are perhaps small but encouraging. For the full year, we saw 5% uplift in the number of transactions and a 12% increase in revenue growth through the site. We expect of course that the larger impact will come from a complete rebuild of the Web site, which we have been working on in the background and which is completely on track to be completed in the second half of 2017.	Some of the enhancements that we expect the new site to have are recognition in guest history, personalized contact and therewith importantly personalized pricing capabilities, scalability or the ability to expand as we bring on more properties and better language support and translations. Also importantly, the site will also be fully integrated with a digital ecosystem to ensure consistent messaging across all of the social media channels.	The last category of operating initiatives is product and investing wisely into our existing properties is a key priority. We have been working diligently to ensure that we are allocating capital effectively to drive the most out of our portfolio.	In 2016, we spent approximately $34 million on project CapEx with a focus on EBITDA enhancement projects, including some of the following that were completed during 2016. The conversion of the back-of-the-house space into four junior suites at the Belmond Villa Sant’Andrea in Sicily; the conversion of meeting space and admin offices into eight new executive suites at the Belmond Miraflores Park in Lima.	Renovation of 48 keys in the main building in Belmond Mount Nelson in Cape Town bringing the total amount of the hotel keys that are renovated in this hotel in recent year to nearly 92%, so we’re nearly there. The addition of a new high-end sports pub utilizing previous lease retail space in high profile location at the Charleston Place in South Carolina; and then the extensive renovation of the Belmond La Residence d’Angkor in Cambodia which we just completed in past November.	As these products came on line throughout 2016, they started contributing to our results with the exception of La Residence d’Angkor which due to a six months closure was actually a drag on our 2016 results. We expect that this property will generate strong year-over-year growth in 2017 and importantly, this hotel now also serves as a brand calling card to our guests, to the travel trade and to the third-party owners in Asia.	As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we completed a project capital review in the second half of 2016 and one of the reasons for doing this was to ensure that we’re employing a comprehensive multiyear outlook instead of a more reactive approach of assessing only the current and the upcoming year.	As a result of this exercise and after gaining better visibility on the opportunities ahead, we made a strategic decision to accelerate or to frontload EBITDA-enhancing projects to start generating incremental organic growth even earlier.	By giving ourselves the time to reevaluate the opportunities before proceeding with certain investments, our actual 2016 project CapEx spend of $34 million came in nowhere than the $40 million to $60 million that we had identified in our June Investor Presentation.	After rolling the balance into the current year, our project CapEx guidance for 2017 rose to $55 million to $75 million. The majority of our 2017 project capital spend will be spend on EBITDA enhancing projects.	Okay. Turning now to our second growth pillar in our strategic plan and that is continuing to build awareness for the Belmond brand. At the beginning of 2016, we spend time to define our brand offering including forming the idea of the authentic escape, which is the golden thread that connects our properties and that helps us differentiate ourselves from the masses of competing luxury brands.	In September, our new Head of Brand & Marketing, Arnaud Champenois joined the company and assumed responsibility for the marketing of the brand and the communication effort. In only a few short months, he and the team have made tremendous strides laying the foundation for our future growth by finalizing our brand story.	They’ve also commenced a detailed review of our creative efforts, including the approach that we will take for our visual identify and for the advertising concept. Later this year, their focus will shift to the communication of this story through our new media strategy, which we expect to unveil when we launch our new Web site in the second half of the year. The media strategy will be more digitally focused than ever and it will have a strong point of view for our social media.	From a public relations perspective, we recently completed a global media roadshow to introduce our strategic plan to key lifestyle, key trade and business media as well as to provide the framework for our brand message and to set the stage for future media outreach.	These efforts included a series of events to engage with the global travel trades and the media in Europe, in Asia and in North America, including in this case many markets on which we had not historically focused.	Looking at the current year, we expect to launch our new train in Peru, the Belmond Andean Explorer in May and new product launches are for us an ideal opportunity to promote not only the new experience but at the same time also the entire brand.	We will use the train’s launch to generate diversity in the second quarter and we will then piggyback off the launch with the global road brand show and related to our events that will take place over the summer.	On the brand front, I truly think that in 2016 we laid a solid foundation for our brand personality from which we can now continue to build awareness for the Belmond brand and really bring the brand to life.	I should emphasize that while establishing the brand in the eyes of the customers is extraordinarily important for our existing properties, it also hold an important place in our footprint expansion activities. Having a differentiated brand story is extremely important in speaking with potential external partners.	Now that provides a nice act to our third key strategic focus area which is build the footprint expansion. The first essential step in expanding our footprint was building a development team.	Previously, we essentially operated with one deal person in this department. Over the course of this past year, we recruited people who I believe will put us in the best shape to source and to execute on new deals.	Our plan calls for a Senior Vice President in London and five supporting professionals to be located in Europe, Middle East, Asia and the Americas. We have strengthened our senior management team by bringing on Kenneth Hatton; Kenneth as our Senior Vice President of Global Development replacing James Simmonds.	Kenneth was most recently with Hyatt where we served as a Senior Vice President, Corporate Transactions Group and covered Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia. Kenneth worked for many years before that as an M&A lawyer and in total has worked on transactions involving approximately 300 different hotels. And I can enthusiastically say that Kenneth is a wonderful addition to our team and I expect that he will be a catalyst in achieving our footprint expansion goals.	Additionally, we recently hired a director who is based in Dubai who primarily serves the Middle East and the Indian Ocean markets. And with this hire we now have three of our five director level positions in place and we expect to hire the final two for Asia and for the Americas in 2017, as it was planned.	Now with our enhanced development team, we have seen an increase in both the quality and the quantity of the opportunities that fit the Belmond brand and can be pursued by this experienced group of people.	In recent months, we have identified a number of attractive deals that fall along this spectrum from third-party management agreements to outright acquisitions, and we have maintained our disciplined approach to evaluating those opportunities and we’re currently assessing several deals that fit the financial metric and the brand requirements that we described at our June Investor and Analysts meeting.	Likewise, we have devoted a meaningful amount of time over the course of last year to develop capital partner relationships as well as other global relationships that we believe will lead to third-party management opportunities; management contracts that leverage our strength as a luxury operator that also understands the business from an owner’s perspective.	I’m increasingly confident that we have our expanding development team in place and combined with the meticulous investment process that we put behind it and the deepened relationship with the key owners and investment groups that this will lead to deal signings. It will lead to deal signings and momentum in our footprint expansion goals.	To conclude, our results for the full year 2016 was strong. They were strong and in line with the long-term metrics that we have laid out in our strategic plan. We performed extraordinarily well for the first nine months of the year, capitalizing on strong demand for both the Olympics in Brazil and the peak summer season in Europe.	The fourth quarter was indeed challenging largely as a result of the difficult economical environment that we have in Brazil at this point in time, which we expect will continue into 2017, as well as the impact of the hurricane Matthew at Belmond Charleston Place. But overall, I’m very pleased with our performance for 2016.	I’m also proud of the team here which quickly came together to form our strategy and over the course of the year commenced or delivered on many important initiatives. And I’m grateful for the contributions of our corporate team and as importantly for those of the people own property who team to operate some of the best hotels and experiences in the world while at the same time helping us to grow and to build a better company.	Looking ahead then, I believe that the foundations that we laid in 2016 and the new people that we recently hired will provide a tailwind for 2017. Our early indication for full year RevPAR growth and overall performance are solid, and I know that the team will remain focused and disciplined as we execute against our near and our long-term goals.	Now with that, I would like to turn the call over to Martin to provide us with more detail on the fourth quarter and full year results for 2016, as well as on the RevPAR guidance. And after Martin speaks, we’ll be happy to answer your questions during Q&A.	With that, Martin, all yours.	Martin O’Grady	Thank you, Roeland, and good morning, everyone. I’ll now take you through some the detail of our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results and I’ll then provide some color on our guidance for 2017. Please note that unless I state otherwise, all the figures I provide will be on a constant currency basis.	As Roeland mentioned, our results for the full year 2016 was strong. We recorded adjusted EBITDA of $128.2 million which represented an 8% year-over-year increase. Our revenue increased by 3% and adjusted EBITDA retention was a very healthy 65% reflecting a culture of strong cost control.	Although our full year results were good, we faced some challenges in the fourth quarter which is one of our two seasonally low quarters. During the fourth quarter, most of our European resort hotels commenced their winter closures and our South American, African and Caribbean hotels typically generate a relatively greater proportion of our EBITDA.	We had anticipated when we gave guidance on our last earnings call that the results of South America would be down, and unfortunately the actual results in particular from Brazil as well as from La Samanna and Saint Martin came in below our expectations. As a result, our fourth quarter constant currency same-store RevPAR came in at minus 7% which compares to our guidance range of minus 5% to minus 1%.	When looking at total results for the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior year quarter, revenue was down $7.4 million and adjusted EBITDA was down $6.8 million with the EBITDA decline driven primarily by our two hotels in Brazil, which contributed $4.2 million or 61% of the decrease.	The other major driver of the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decrease was our trains and cruises business which came in $2.2 million lower than in the prior year quarter. This business was once again impacted by the recent insurgence supply in river cruise operated in Myanmar.	We also recognized our first year of an expected offseason EBITDA loss for the Belmond Grand Hibernian train in Ireland after very successful partial season following its launch at the end of August. And the demand-related decreasing revenue for our Venice Simplon Orient-Express train was compounded by margin compression as a result of the train’s operating costs in euros whereas its revenues are in British pound which weakened.	Our result for the fourth quarter across the rest of our portfolio are detailed in our earnings release and for the large part are not particularly meaningful in the context of a largely successful full year 2016, so allow me to also reflect on that.	On the whole, we are pleased with the performance of our portfolio despite some challenging headwinds in various regions. Brazil dominated our results both on the upside and downside.	Belmond Copacabana Palace in Rio tended a strong performance in the third quarter as it benefitted from the Olympic Games, but the hotel was negatively impacted in the second and fourth quarters by a pre and post-Olympics lull and also by Brazil’s economic and political crisis. On a net basis for the full year of 2016, Belmond Copacabana Palace’s adjusted EBITDA was up $3 million over the prior year.	Our full year results benefitted from healthy performances across our European portfolio with the exception of Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Venice which operated in the year without the Biennale art festival. Excluding Cipriani, our owned European hotels adjusted EBITDA increased $5.4 million year-over-year.	Our other hotels in Europe were marginally able to drive rate by successfully leveraging strong demand in peak periods. Belmond La Residence d'Angkor also benefitted from increased U.S. business due to targeted marketing efforts and Belmond Villa Sant’Andrea in Sicily, so growth from the four new junior suites we opened in the second quarter.	We also saw strong results from Belmond Reid's Palace in Madeira which grew adjusted EBITDA by $1.6 million year-over-year as the hotel benefitted from leisure businesses displaced from North African markets and increased airlift, as well as from Belmond Grand Hotel in Russia where we were encouraged by an $800,000 year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase.	This growth was largely occupancy driven due in part to successful sales and marketing efforts in Asia and the Middle East. In North America, we were less successful in driving year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. Belmond Maroma and Riviera Maya, Mexico was challenged by increased competition and Belmond La Samanna like many hotels in the Caribbean contend with decreased demand as a result of weaker concerns.	Belmond Charleston Place which adjusted EBITDA was more or less in line with the prior year had in fact been on track for another record year following the completion of its rooms for refurbishment but faced a setback with hurricane Matthew in October when the City of Charleston was evacuated and the hotel closed for four days.	I’ve already touched on rest of the world region for which we had good growth largely as a result of Belmond Copacabana Palace’s $3 million year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase. Also within this region, Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and our safari lodges in Botswana had strong years both benefitting from recent refurbishments.	And in Asia, results for our hotels were largely aligned with the prior year with the exception of Belmond La Residence d'Angkor which was closed for a planned renovation for approximately six months.	Looking at our trains and cruises segment, our owned businesses faced a number of challenges, some of which I have already mentioned in discussing our fourth quarter results whereas our PeruRail trains business had a very strong year following the commencement of additional freight transportation contracts for two large copper mines and another year of strong passenger train results.	Our central costs in total including share-based compensation and central marketing were well controlled coming in at $38.4 million which was a $5.7 million decrease from the prior year in dollar terms. 2016 central costs benefitted by $2.3 million from a weaker British pound for which the average rate to the U.S. dollar was 11% lower than in the prior year. So in total for the full year 2016, same-store worldwide RevPAR and revenue both increased 3% year-over-year and total adjusted EBITDA grew 8% to $128.2 million.	Turning to our balance sheet at December 31, 2016, we had total debt of $591 million, total cash including restricted cash was $156 million resulting in total net debt of $435 million. Net leverage was 3.4x as compared to 3.7x at the end of 2015. This decrease is the result of a $9 million reduction in our debt balance and a $9 million increase in last 12 months adjusted EBITDA.	Our $105 million corporate revolver remains undrawn. So including the revolver but excluding restricted cash, our total cash availability was $258 million at the end of the fourth quarter providing strong liquidity for the initial stages of growth as laid out in our strategic plan. Our fixed to floating interest split was 48% fixed to 52% floating. Our weighted average interest rate was 4.3% and our weighted average debt maturity was 3.9 years.	Now looking forward to 2017, we have provided full year RevPAR guidance of 1% to 5% on a constant currency basis and 2% to 6% growth in a U.S. dollar basis. This guidance reflects a robust outlook at a number of properties partially offset by what we expect will be a challenging year in Brazil.	Brazil will of course have a tough comparable year given that adjusted EBITDA for Belmond Copacabana Palace for the third quarter of 2016 when the Olympics were held was up $5.7 million over the third quarter of 2015.	We hear that business sentiment is starting to improve as Brazil’s new President implements tighter fiscal policies. However, our forward bookings do not yet support this view and we are projecting that combined full year adjusted EBITDA from our two hotels in Brazil to be down by between $6 million and $8 million year-over-year.	As you may expect, we have been working and will continue to work on reducing costs to try to minimize the impact of what we expect will be a soft demand year. We believe the hotel will be well positioned for a significant bounce back once the next cycle of economic recovery takes a stern hold. Apart from one or two other softer hotels, we are expecting a very positive year for the rest of the portfolio.	Looking specifically at Europe, the Biennale art festival will take place in Venice this year and bookings are beginning to look quite strong in Italy as well as for the rest of our European hotels. Our expectations for 2017 are helped by recent investments including the six new junior suites [indiscernible] expected to open in June, our first full year of having the four new junior suites at Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea and the addition of [indiscernible] 12 rooms at Belmond Hotel Splendido in Portofino. And of course we’ll be able to drive higher rates on those rooms.	We are also forecasting further improvements in Russia where our hotel is expected to benefit from strong group business, the 21st annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June and the Confederations Cup in FIFA’s soccer tournament between the World Cup host nation and seven regional champions later in June and into July. This tournament takes place in the year prior to the World Cup which in 2018 will be in Russia.	In North America, we’re expecting a strong year in Charleston hopefully without another hurricane but in the year with what is expected to be a more buoyant U.S. economy and where we expect to continue to capitalize on our recent investments in rooms, through the beverage outlets and meeting and banqueting spaces. We also have recently signed a two-year contract for an airline crew business which gives us a larger base of business off of which to yield higher rates at this hotel.	Also, in North America, we are expecting better results from Belmond El Encanto in Santa Barbara where our first flow start. We have adapted our selling strategies and now yielding higher rated leisure business particularly on weekends and establishing nice pace of group business both of which are leading to strong 2017 pace.	Turning to our rest of world region. As noted, Brazil is the main contributor on the downside but on the upside we expect to see strong growth again at our hotel in Cape Town and from our safari’s operation, both of which are expected to continue to benefit from recent investments.	Also following investment, we will have a full year of a renovated Belmond La Residence d'Angkor which is expected to have a strong year. This hotel is excluded from our same-store statistics, so it does not contribute to the RevPAR guidance we have provided but it will of course play a role in our year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth.	Looking beyond hotels, we expect to see year-over-year revenue growth for our owned trains and cruises business which will be helped by Belmond Grand Hibernian in its first full year of operations and also by Belmond [indiscernible] for which we recently increased capacity by adding a new carriage which also included a spa treatment carriage that has been generating incredible publicity for that train.	As we progress on our strategic plan, we will continue to invest in additional resources particularly in relation to our footprint expansion activities, our project management office and our sales efforts. As such, you should expect an increase in central costs in 2017 as noted in the guidance we have provided in our earnings release and in line with what we had assumed in the 2020 aspirational EBITDA goals we laid out in our June 2016 Investor Presentation.	In terms of currency, we are currently projecting a very small net impact on our full year 2017 results as we expected year-over-year movement in other trading currencies are largely offsetting one another. The exception is in the expected weaker average rate for the British pound which positively impacts our reported dollar central costs but negatively impacts the translation of our UK operations. In aggregate, we are currently projecting a net marginal positive impact from a weaker pound.	With all that said, for the full year we are expecting that the first quarter of 2017 like our most recent quarter, as Roeland mentioned, will be challenging. Off a seasonally low base, we are expecting RevPAR to decline between minus 11% and minus 7% on a constant currency basis and between minus 5% and minus 1% on a U.S. dollar basis.	As I previously mentioned, the first quarter is seasonally more important for our hotels in Brazil and Cape Town and as we are forecasting stronger average exchange rates for the Brazilian real and South African rand for the first quarter of 2017 than for the prior year quarter, we currently expect that our U.S. dollar RevPAR result will be better than our constant currency RevPAR results.	Now as a reminder, for the entire company, Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter where we incur EBITDA losses for our businesses that have annual winter closures which include all of our Italian hotels, Belmond La Residence d'Angkor and most of our European trains.	And when combined with our RevPAR expectations, we are currently projecting that adjusted EBITDA will decrease year-over-year for the first quarter but this reduction should be offset by greater EBITDA growth over the balance of the year.	And to give you some color on that year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decreases, we’re currently projecting for the first quarter, I’m going to give you some additional detail and the ranges I provide are on a U.S. dollar basis.	For our European hotels, we’re projecting a drop of between $1.5 million and $2.5 million partly due to a change in the seasonal allocation of higher expenses for our Italian hotels and also the timing of Easter which took place in the first quarter of 2016 but occurs in the second quarter of 2017.	In the rest of the world hotels, we’re projecting a decrease of between $1.5 million and $2.5 million due largely to Brazil. And for our owned trains and cruises, we are currently expecting a $1 million to $2 million decline primarily driven by Venice Simplon Orient-Express as a result of margin compression related to a weaker British pound and Belmond Grand Hibernian as a result of it being the train’s first Q1 for which we expected will typically operate in an EBITDA loss position.	And lastly, total central costs including development, marketing and share-based compensation expenses we’re anticipating a $1.5 million to $2.5 million unfavorable variance due in part to our new development resources and activities, plus a recent change in the seasonal allocation of our central marketing costs.	Now you’ve heard what I’ve had to say about our first quarter 2017 but I will remind you that our view is that for the full year 2017 still holds as a result of expected increases for the remainder of the year, and we’re expecting to have another solid year of growth with constant currency RevPAR expected to increase between 1% and 5%.	So that concludes our prepared remarks. And before I hand you back to the operator for Q&A, we would like to request that you limit your questions asked to two per person. Thank you very much. Operator?	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of David Katz. Please go ahead.	David Katz	Hi. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon. The first question is, Roeland, you talked about CapEx. If I heard correctly, you said 55 million to 77 million for '17. And the reason for doing that is to drive greater EBITDA growth sooner. I will admit that there is a lot of information here that I’m still taking notes and processing on, because 1Q is going to be weak but we’re still I believe if I heard correctly, we’re still talking about EBITDA being up year-over-year for the full year. How much of that is driven by the incremental CapEx and what the sort of drivers of that upside? Is that prior changes in CapEx or this current CapEx that you’re spending now?	Roeland Vos	Well, you’re absolutely right that the numbers that we’re projecting for '17 are still very positive. And I think in the guidance that Martin just provided you with, that comes out very clear. For as far as the review of the capital is concerned, we have been looking at all of the – let’s say the next three to four years that would be part of the plan that we’re looking at here and be looking at which of those EBITDA enhancing projects can we move forward in a material way. And what we have been looking at is to say what needs to be done in order to get those projects executed earlier and how far can we bring them forward. If we look at, for example, the 2017 CapEx, 65% of that will be EBITDA enhancing capital spend. Similar things would apply to the year thereof or for 2018. So what happened here in actual effect is that you see that the under spend that we had for 2016 is tagged on to 2017 and as a total for these two years, and we still see it in line with what we had planned. The idea would be that going forward there are a number of EBITDA enhancing projects that we’re working on that we would hope to be able to get to the different stages of development and planning processes and then we would tag those on to the year 2018 as soon as we possibly can.	Martin O’Grady	But the other part of the question was how much of the growth next year relates to investment done last year and previously years, and I’m not able to quantify right now what the exact amounts are for each one. But we certainly are seeing the benefits coming through quite strongly. We saw that last year in places like Mount Nelson where we very successfully refurbished the hotel over a base period. We’re seeing it particularly optimistic next year for Charleston Place, for example, where we had that full rooms refurbishment not just the rooms but also the bar and the banqueting spaces more recently. Even Russia we’re seeing its good domestic demand holding up and we’ve redone recently a very beautiful banqueting space which is largely for domestic groups and with other events going on there, we’ll continue to benefit there. The safari camps, certainly it’s going to have a major impact on the operation next gen. Of course La Residence d'Angkor which was closed last year we’ll be benefitting from. So the whole list of different projects, David, that we’ve invested in and cash [indiscernible] when it’s hard to distinguish individual numbers. But we feel very positive about the current record and success we’ve had from prior investments. And with a good long list of new opportunities, we feel very optimistic about delivering on the organic growth objectives we’ve set out in our plan.	David Katz	All right. And if I can ask one more about CapEx in a different way. You brought some people on to pursue development opportunities. And one of the fair questions is, will there need to be investments whether it’s key money or sliver [ph] equity in order to capture management contracts? And I suppose a part of that question is the M&A landscape which is also part of what you’re pursuing at this point. What are you seeing out there? And I’m just trying to get a sense for what you might ultimately spend for 2017 and on what?	Roeland Vos	Yes, I think that’s a very fair question. And as part of our overall plan we clearly have laid out that part of our growth is going to come from management contracts where key money or limited guarantees would play an important role. Now depending on the number of those type of deals that we would be able to sign in 2017 that will define which monies will go out of the door in the form of key money contributions. Similar things would apply to the spread of deals that we could potentially do in the acquisition range where we’ll offer both of them, we have provided that our balance sheet is in a position where we can do those deals at least for the coming year without having to go through different ways of funding those. So I think all that is captured in the strategic plan. For as far as the M&A landscape is concerned, as I just mentioned with the new people that we have onboard for a few months now and Kenneth just joining us in January, we start seeing that the discussions are getting more intense around what the opportunities are for the brand to expand. We see a lot of opportunities passing by that would actually fit both our financial as well as our brand needs. And in that sense I think it’s reconfirming the kind of plans that we have laid out in our strategic plan and that we feel comfortable that we should be able to execute a number of those deals as we move forward.	Martin O’Grady	I think it’s hard to quantify exactly what the actual cash outflows will be this year. It will very much depend upon the deals that are done. But of course we will give you plenty of color as and when that – when that comes out of that. It’s not a question of if but when given the team that we’ve now got in place.	David Katz	Maybe the better way to ask the question is do you think that there’s some likelihood that we will see some management contract deals done this year and/or M&A opportunities done this year?	Roeland Vos	And I think the answer to both of those is yes, David.	David Katz	Got it, okay. Thank you very much.	Operator	And your next question is coming now from the line of Anthony Powell. Please ask your question.	Anthony Powell	Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on your EBITDA commentary that you gave. You’re saying that you expect EBITDA to increase year-over-year despite some of the challenges in Brazil. Is that taking to account the increase in central costs as well?	Martin O’Grady	Yes, it does. That wasn’t twofold. Yes.	Roeland Vos	And I think that Martin just read a number of reasons in the perspective of why we think that it’s achievable or why we think that it’s logical that we see upside in those EBITDA performances in those properties and as a whole as a company. And part of that was the ones that were mentioned in relation to capital spend but also in the prepared remarks. You heard Martin speak about Russia where we would have a number of events that will materially drive upside to our business as we have things in South Africa going our way, the safari camps going our way. But like that there is a long list of individual properties where we can very clearly see that there is upside on the year-over-year balance with good reason and where you can expect the EBITDA numbers will come in, in different ways throughout the year but in a very positive way.	Martin O’Grady	And I should clarify that the expected increase in EBITDA even with the increase in central costs is excluding any development growth. So when we get the development growth that would be also accretive.	Anthony Powell	Got it. Thanks. And in terms of just funding some of your development priorities, you’ve been building cash on the balance sheet. Are you going to use your cash for those purposes or are there more assets to sell in order to fund some growth opportunities?	Martin O’Grady	I think consistent with what I’ve said before, we do have some cash. We also have flexibility within our debt structure. And before we take on any very significant commitment or significant acquisitions, we would be looking to first sell something to fund that.	Anthony Powell	All right, great. That’s it for me. Thank you.	Martin O’Grady	Thanks, Anthony.	Roeland Vos	Thanks, Anthony.	Operator	And there’s a final question coming from the line of Bryerman. Please go ahead.	Howard Bryerman	Good morning. Can you guys hear me?	Roeland Vos	Yes, Howard. How are you?	Howard Bryerman	I’m doing well. Good morning. Thanks guys. So two quick questions. Martin, with the Q1 guidance and the increase in corporate and development costs, I guess the question is for both of you guys. '17 looks to be shaping up as a year in which the EBITDA growth CAGR to 2020 looks below kind of the high single digits stated goal. Am I thinking about that correctly? And if yes, that implies I guess a pretty significant acceleration in years '18 to '20. So do you still feel confident in the high-single digit EBITDA CAGR on the organic side? That’s question number one. And then Roeland for you, you talked about a bunch of deals that you’re looking at. I’m hoping you could reiterate your comments from Analyst Day that you won’t do a deal that’s dilutive to your current EBITDA multiple? Thanks guys.	Roeland Vos	All right. Let me start with the last piece. One of the reasons why we need the right people in the right place is because we want to execute smart deals that actually are accretive to our business and that fits within the financial marker we had put for ourselves and we will be very diligent in the execution of that. So I think that we should not be worrying about that piece of it. For as far as the organic growth is concerned – the CAGRs are concerned, I’ll let Martin fill in some of the details but we still see that '17 will be falling well within the boundaries of what we would be looking for without giving individual guidance on where EBITDA will end up.	Martin O’Grady	I’ll talk to that. I think we still have a plan and we’re very confident in our plan and we’ll be hitting the targets that we set out.	Roeland Vos	I don’t think that – the worry is that it turns in to be a big hockey stick. That is something that you should worry about. I think that the build-up is exactly as it was planned during the plan was laid out in June. Obviously, there will be variances to any plan that you make for five years. But at the end of the day, this is in striking distance of what we had laid out for 2017.	Howard Bryerman	Since I’m the last question, can I get one more?	Martin O’Grady	No man [ph].	Howard Bryerman	For someone that’s been around the group for nine months, I think I’m entitled to it. So, Martin, you talked about some trends at El Encanto. I guess relative to the original EBITDA target for the property, can you talk about the trajectory of the EBITDA ramp there? It sounds like you’re making some progress. I’m just curious what kind of return on the original $150 million of CapEx we’re looking at?	Martin O’Grady	Bryerman, we’ve known each other a long time and we know that when we restarted that project, yes of course the book value is a big high number of 134 but when we took the decision to recommence, we invested I think round about $17 million. We certainly are on an upward trajectory now. We got off to a slow start and we made some important changes. And I think Roeland, you want to say something.	Roeland Vos	What I think is actually be encouraging for El Encanto and I think that that is some of the upside that we see. We made some operational changes here. And one of the things that I mentioned before between the alignment of sales and the revenue management resources, and this hotel will be a typical example where we see the benefit of aligning what it takes to align sales with revenue management instead of them having working as different entities. So what we’ve seen here is it’s very nice that those two teams and the efforts that we’re putting in are paying off in a big way. And if you compare it to last year, last year being '16, we see that for '17, our group business is up. And group business not only up with the little number but with 85% year-over-year pace, which I think is pretty remarkable for a hotel this size. And it’s not just that it’s up from a number of bookings perspective but it’s also up in the right moments of the week which is clearly important for a place like El Encanto. So group business in the week and revenue management folks on maximizing rate in the weekends, which for that place is crucial. Now it goes without saying that we have been reinforcing folks on one of the very important market there, which is the entertainment market in Los Angeles and investing in that which in a place like this comes nearly or dramatically we would say, but there was a big opportunity where we walked in and we banked on that. And I’m looking forward to 2017 to see what we can do even further. So things are looking good and I think Martin answered your question first as far as the initial investments are concerned. But at least going forward, things are only up.	Howard Bryerman	Understood. Thanks, guys.	Roeland Vos	So that was the last question then, Bryerman?	Howard Bryerman	I’ve got last more, if there’s nobody else.	Roeland Vos	Thanks a lot.	Amy Brandt	Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. We look forward to speaking to you in a few months.	Roeland Vos	Thanks, everybody.	Operator	That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect.

On today’s call, Assi will begin with a few opening remarks on financial performance for the quarter, Danny will cover additional financial details before turning it over to Uzi to offer a few closing strategic comments.	With that, I’ll turn the call over to Assi.	Assi Ginzburg:	Thank you, Keith. For the fourth quarter 2016, Delek U.S. reported net income of $44.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $31.5 million or $0.51 per basic share in the fourth quarter last year. Including in our reported results for the fourth quarter 2016 was an after-tax gain of $80.6 million or $1.30 per share related to the sale of our retail assets.	In November, we closed a transaction to sell our retail-related assets to COPEC for $535 million plus a working capital adjustment and retail cash on hand at closing. This resulted in proceeds of approximately $379 million before taxes. Taxes are expected to be paid in the first and second quarter of 2017.	We improved our financial flexibility in the fourth quarter, ending with approximately $689 million of cash on a consolidated basis and $145 million of net debt. Including Delek and Delek Logistics, we had net cash of approximately $249 million as of December 31, 2016. This compared to a net debt of approximately $137 million excluding DKL at September 30, 2016.	Now I will turn it over to Danny to discuss additional financial details.	Danny Norris	Thank you, Assi. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Delek U.S. reported an adjusted net loss of $27.7 million or $0.44 per basic share compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.3 million or $0.07 per basic share in the prior year period. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included in the financial tables of our press release. The primary driver of the exchange on a year-over-year basis was reduced performance in our refining segment, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.	Our 47% investment in Alon USA resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $21.8 million in the prior year period. Prior year results included $18.7 million related to a goodwill impairment at Alon and the effect of a scheduled turnaround at Alon’s Krotz Springs refinery.	Our operating expenses declined by $7.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This decline was driven primarily by $1.3 million of lower utility costs, and the remaining decline was primarily attributable to reduced outside services and maintenance expenses due in part to cost reduction initiatives.	General and administrative expenses increased $9.9 million on a year-over-year basis. During the fourth quarter of 2016, there was approximately $5.5 million of transaction expenses primarily related to the sale of the retail assets and the announced Alon transaction. Also in the prior year period, G&A was lowered by $6.4 million relating to proceeds from a litigation settlement.	Finally, our income tax rate excluding the non-controlling interest income associated with Delek Logistics of $4.6 million was 48.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.	Turning now to capital spending, our capital expenditures during the period were approximately $22.1 million compared to $40.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we spent $13.5 million in our refining segment and $6.7 million in our logistics segment. Our 2017 capital expenditures are forecasted to be $80.7 million, which compares to $46.3 million in 2016. This amount includes $57.1 million in our refining segment, $18.1 million in our logistics segment, and $5.5 million at the corporate level.	Now I would like to discuss our results by segment. In our refining segment, we reported a negative contribution margin of $3.6 million compared to a contribution margin of $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Results were lower due to several factors, including a timing effect from an increasing crude oil price environment in the fourth quarter of this year that reduced margin realization. We faced continued pressure in the wholesale business on netbacks across terminals created by non-obligated parties as ethanol RIN prices averaged $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Also, the fourth quarter of 2016 included a net hedging loss of $17 million compared to a $2 million hedging loss in the prior year period. In addition, there was a $12.2 million lower benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the biodiesel tax credit on a year-over-year basis.	Partially offsetting the factors above was a Gulf Coast 5:3:2 crack spread that averaged $9.26 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $8.78 per barrel in the prior year period, and operating expenses declined $4.5 million on a year-over-year basis. We were able to achieve per-barrel operating expense of $3.76 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $4.02 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, which is partially due to our cost reduction initiatives. In addition, there is a combined LCM and other inventory benefit of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a charge of $14 million in the prior year period. This benefit was from inventory primarily at the Tyler refinery and was partially offset by an adverse inventory effect at El Dorado.	RINs expense related to blending obligations in the refining segment decreased to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $14.2 million in the prior year period. The fourth quarter of 2015 included RINs expense related to prior period true-ups of $6.3 million. The differential between Midland and Cushing averaged $0.24 per barrel discount in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a premium of $0.02 per barrel in the prior year period. Contango in the crude oil fuels futures market was $0.89 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to contango of $0.92 per barrel in the prior year period.	I want to provide some additional comments on El Dorado. When we look at the performance on year-over-year basis of this refinery, it experienced an adverse effect associated with asphalt and its supply and offtake agreement, which on a combined basis accounted for an approximately $16.1 million year-over-year decline in performance. We experienced some benefit from market changes in January 2017 that resulted in a positive inventory effect at El Dorado compared to the fourth quarter 2016 results. As we have entered the first quarter of 2017, RINs prices have declined sequentially from the fourth quarter, and this has both a direct and indirect effect on our operations. A lower RINs price reduces our expense related to purchasing RINs to meet our blending requirements. In addition, it may improve the competitive dynamics as there is a reduced incentive for non-obligated blenders in the wholesale channel.	From a modeling standpoint for the first quarter, we wanted to provide some guidance around Tyler operating rates. During January and February, we had some scheduled down time work in the vacuum tower and NHT as well as a catalyst change-out. This resulted in 16 days of down time during the first quarter. During January, our crude throughput was 46,600 barrels per day, and in February our estimated crude throughput is 52,000 barrels per day. In March, we expect to match production to commercial demand at Tyler.	Now I would like to review our logistics segment, which is comprised of the results from Delek Logistics Partners. Our logistics segment contribution margin was $27.1 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to $26.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. On a year-over-year basis, results were increased by improved performance in the West Texas wholesale business and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower performance from the Paline pipeline and the SALA gathering system.	Now I will turn the call over to Uzi for his closing remarks.	Uzi Yemin	Thank you, Danny, and good morning. As many of you know, on January 3 we reached a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining outstanding common stock of Alon that we do not already own in an all-stock transaction. Our S-4 will be filed this morning and this will put us on course to close by midyear, subject to approval of both the Delek U.S. and Alon shareholders.	We remain excited about the opportunities that will be created through the acquisition. We believe that we can create approximately $95 million of pre-tax synergies and have the potential to unlock $78 million of EBITDA from logistics assets that currently reside within Alon. This will create a premium focused refining system with approximately 200,000 barrels per day of assets on a combined basis, and our logistics system is well positioned to support this larger operation.	With the potential of an increased inventory of logistics assets following the acquisition of Alon, we will have improved the visibility for growth for [indiscernible] as these assets can be dropped down in the future. Based on DKL’s guidance for distribution growth per limited partner unit of at least 10% through 2019, we would expect the distributions to the general partner to be approximately $90 million in 2017 and potentially grow to $33 million in 2019 using this 10% growth rate.	We ended the year with a very strong cash position with approximately $689 million in cash and are well positioned to use this financial flexibility as we move forward with the next stage in our growth, while remaining focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.	With that, Tiffany, could you please open the call for questions?	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator instructions]	Your first question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.	Paul Sankey	Hi, good morning everyone. Uzi, this is always a question for you guys, but can you update us on the latest activities in the Permian in terms of both gathering and how you see the offtake balance for future growth out of that basin? Thank you.	Uzi Yemin	Good morning, Mr. Sankey.	Paul Sankey	Hello sir.	Uzi Yemin	As usual, your questions are very broad, so I’ll try to tackle it from a couple of angles, if you will. First of all, as we all know the data - you don’t need me for that, the Permian production grew over the last two months by 100,000 barrels, so that’s 50,000 barrels per month on average. I don’t know if we can maintain this growth rate, but this 100 indicates that the 300 to 400 that we were thinking in the beginning of the year may be conservative, if you will.	For me, the first point, and we said it in the past many times, the first point of balancing is not between production and offtake capacity. It is between production and the take-or-pays, and we gather some information to understand how much take-or-pays there are in the area. We are not done with our internal research because it takes a tremendous amount of effort, but we believe that in the next few months, we will get to a situation that the take-or-pay--or production exceeds take-or-pay.	Now, we know that there were several announcements lately of extending of a couple of pipelines. I don’t think that there were any--to my knowledge, there are no new take-or-pay under these agreements, so the first sign of the market balancing will be when we see production exceeding take-or-pay and the discount at the premium is going to go to a pipeline tariff, if you will.	With that being said, we already see signs that in 2018, 2019 if you look at the future market, we are--it’s inching down, or the differentials are inching up, and while this year it’s still around zero, fourth quarter is already showing around a buck, 2018 is more than that, and 2019 even better.	We still don’t think that the market fully reflects the differential between oil, the gap between the production and the take-or-pay, and then the second point will be when production will exceed the entire capacity. I know that many of us focus on [indiscernible] capacity, but being an operator of pipelines, I don’t think that using 100% is the right number. It’s probably close to 90%, maybe 92% year-round, so again it will be interesting to see when we reach that point, I assume that point will add new pipelines will be somewhere in between 2018 and 2019.	I hope I answered your question.	Paul Sankey	You did, actually you did more than answer, but then you raised a whole lot of questions. One I’ll just have a follow-up, if you don’t mind, wouldn’t the producers be incentivized not to commit to take-or-pay if they saw too much capacity?	Uzi Yemin	As I said in the past, I think that we--many of us learned the lesson of these take-or-pays and being paralyzed on that, so I don’t see companies rushing into signing a take-or-pay. Certainly Delek is not rushing to sign new take-or-pays, and I believe that most companies think the same way we do.	Paul Sankey	Great. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow in New York, Uzi, and anyone else who wants to join us. Maybe you can publicize that, thanks.	Uzi Yemin	Okay, thank you.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.	Neil Mehta	Hey, good morning Assi and Uzi.	Uzi Yemin	Neil, good morning.	Neil Mehta	Good morning. Uzi, can you start off by talking a little bit about the timeline associated with the closing of the Alon transaction, just how you’re thinking about it playing out from a time perspective?	Uzi Yemin	You know, Assi is not allowed to sleep or eat until he closes this deal, so I’ll let him answer that.	Assi Ginzburg	Neil, good morning. Our goal this morning would be to file the S-4. We hope we get it as soon as the market opens. That basically will give the SEC the ability to start reviewing the materials. If we don’t get any material comment, we can probably within 50 days after that amount be very close to be able to close the transaction, which will put us somewhere in early May. If the SEC will require and have some questions, maybe it will be as late as June 1. That’s our goal right now, and everything is on track on both sides to be prepared to respond to the SEC questions.	Neil Mehta	Thanks Assi. You highlighted in the release there will be a tax repayment associated with the retail transaction. Do you know how much that’s going to be? Has that been defined yet?	Assi Ginzburg	Sure, so when we look at the 2016 operating income or loss for Delek combined with the network transaction gain, which is mostly ordinary gain and not a capital gain, we expect roughly a Q1 tax payment of around $12 million and in Q2 we expect to pay the remaining, which is around $50 million. So basically we’re talking about $62 million that will leave our cash somewhere in May 2017.	Neil Mehta	Okay, that’s great. Last question is this morning, you have another sharp pullback in RINs prices. There’s some talk that Icahn reached a deal with the biofuels group here--or with the EPA, I should say, and your gasoline cracks, which are down by a similar amount. Are you of the view that RINs prices will ultimately translate--lower RINs prices will translate to the bottom line, or do you think that a lot of this is ultimately in the cracks?	Uzi Yemin	Neil, I think that you’ve asked that question in the past, and I think that for everybody’s benefit, some of the RINs prices are in the cracks. I can’t believe that it’s not, so if we expect all of a sudden to get--this morning, RINs were $0.40, that all of a sudden we’ll get $0.40 directly to the bottom line, I think that we are, as a refiner, kidding ourselves.	With that being said, the market is extremely--let me use not a strong word, but even though I feel very strongly about it, the market is--because of the price of RINs, the market is so inefficient and people are moving barrels from one place to another without paying attention to the pipeline tariff, and that needs to change. The incentive for this shipping all around the country with no incentive, just the RINs, that will change and we will go back to what we saw in 2011 and before that of normalized wholesale margins versus very weak wholesale margins that rely only on RINs. That should help mainly the niche market refineries in our mind.	Neil Mehta	That’s great, guys. Thank you.	Uzi Yemin	Thank you.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.	Ed Westlake	I guess two questions. The first one may be more about financial management. Obviously you’ve built up cash successfully at Delek and you don’t have to spend too much money on the Delek refineries. You’ll get some cash on the balance sheet with ALJ but also some debt, and then you can drop into DKL and raise more cash at the parent. So maybe talk about what the main plans are for that cash, particularly interested in buybacks and/or dividends.	Uzi Yemin	Well absolutely. First, good morning, Ed. As we said in the past, we have the $150 million that our board of directors approved for the buyback, and also we continue to pay our dividend. Our long-term policy, and we’ll refine it and come exactly with numbers to the market, will be to continue to give money back to shareholders. The sale of the retail allowed us to collect a lot of cash. We paid some debt, and we feel comfortable with our financial situation.	With that being said, as we said in the past, with the pending acquisition of Alon, there are some quick hit projects that we will come to the market after the closing and disclose them. We all remember that Alon over the last few years did a great job paying down debt, and that left us with several projects that are quick hit projects.	With the improved outlook of the Permian, our plan is to come to the market with a comprehensive plan of how we’re going to divide between capex and return money to shareholders.	Ed Westlake	Okay, and then maybe on that second point, you’ve had great success with Caddo and RIO to participate in the tariff, which you have to pay to access crude - you know, that provides EBITDA to DKL, potentially it lowers your cost or increases your crude flexibility. But I suspect you’re not finished with that process, so maybe if there’s any comments in general terms you can help us understand the scope of the potential opportunity to sort of further integrate with the upstream and perhaps lower the cost of supply.	Uzi Yemin	That’s a great question. That’s actually in the heart of our discussion with our board of directors yesterday. We have obviously now--we will have with Alon, subject to Assi and Amber finishing the deal, we will have four refineries. One of them is in the heart of the Permian Basin. Actually if you look at Howard County, which is the best county, Big Spring is in the middle of that county. I would like to say here for that years, Delek relied on many other people to help us, and they did a great job helping us getting our crude into our refineries; but now we have the vehicle that can--we can do it ourselves. We are in the middle of a process to find out how we want our refineries and how we want the logistics assets to support our refineries. We paid a tremendous amount of fees to other MLPs. They all did a great job for us, but with the growth, we think we can pay some fees to ourselves as well.	Ed Westlake	Okay, thank you very much.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.	Roger Read	Hey, good morning.	Uzi Yemin	Good morning, Roger.	Roger Read	Hey, and Assi might get to have breakfast, at least. We understand the S-4 has hit the tape here.	Uzi Yemin	Don’t get him too excited. He is allowed to drink his tea - that’s it.	Roger Read	Okay, well at least there’s a little movement there. If we could maybe talk a little bit about the possible benefits of the much lower RINs prices, I think the last time we had a good discussion, the indication was in the third and fourth quarter the higher RINs prices really hurt capture. Let’s assume that the news out here today keeps RINs prices in a sub-$0.40 range kind of first half of this year. How can we think about that as flowing through to capture rates? I mean, you mentioned that it’s created quite a number of inefficiencies in the market, and maybe if RINs back off as a driver of cost structure, how does that help Delek improve its capture?	Assi Ginzburg	Roger, that’s a great question. If you look at our 2016 results, when we were somewhere between $0.80 to $0.90 on average, our overall actual cost to purchase RINs was around $40 million to $50 million, which is almost a buck a barrel. If RINs are going by half and maybe even lower than that after today’s announcement, at least it looks like half of that cost will go away, so that’s immediately going to benefit us by $20 million to $25 million month-by-month.	What you don’t see on top of it, the wholesale business at both refineries probably over the last year and a half, I will say we lost at least that amount, which is another $40 million to $50 million, a buck a barrel in some cases on basically a reduction in wholesale margin. Wholesalers will not be able to compete anymore with refineries in an unfair base, and that was the situation over the last two years. We believe that if we go back to normality, both refineries eventually can benefit between $1 to $2 a barrel, going back to historical margins.	So I think this can be for Delek on a long-term basis worth probably $100 million. With that being said, I don’t know what will happen to [indiscernible], and for Alon it can probably be not as big an amount but also a significant amount.	Hopefully I answered the question.	Roger Read	No, that’s helpful. At least it kind of frames up the ideas that are there, for sure. Then I understand the intricacies around getting the transaction completed, but maybe going back, Uzi, to your comments about trying to balance investments in the Permian Basin, which I assume included the Big Spring refinery and shareholder returns, can you give us an idea of maybe some of the--maybe a dollar value of some of the opportunities you see in and around Big Spring once the transaction has moved forward?	Uzi Yemin	We do have that information, Roger; however, I think it will be a little bit out of school. That’s an ALJ discussion and probably Alan, who did a great job on the call a couple of days ago, if he wanted, he would have given you some color. But at this point, just put it this way - we’ve got the information, we’ll disclose it as we get closer to the closing and we feel more comfortable legally doing so.	Roger Read	All right. I tried to get it on their call, but I couldn’t make star, one work, so I thought I’d try you. But thank you anyway.	Uzi Yemin	Roger, just as a follow-up to your question about the RINs, I’m going to say one more thing. It’s not a big point for either refiner, but it is big for Delek U.S. It’s really we’re changing the tax credit for the biodiesel to a producers credit versus a blenders credit. I just want to refresh everybody’s memory that we do have, together with Alon, three biodiesel plants and in the fourth quarter, the combination of all these three plants made more than, call it $12 million, so really the change is going to be implemented on the producer side on the biodiesel credit. That’s a big, big plus this morning, and that’s one of the reasons you’ll hear us smiling this morning with the news that came out.	Roger Read	Great, so is that $12 million a quarter? The credit’s not worth $12 million a quarter, those businesses are making $12 million a quarter and then there’s a tax benefit in addition to that?	Uzi Yemin	Well, it made $12 million--I’m going by memory. It was at least $12 million in the fourth quarter, but that was under the assumption of blenders credits. When you’re talking about producers credits on the biodiesel side, that’s a whole different game because now imports will come down or they will match, the $1 will go only to American producers, which we are a big portion of that, or we have a substantial portion of that. Then presumably not only the credit will help us, but the fact that it’s a producer credit and not blenders credit.	Roger Read	Okay, great. Thank you.	Operator	Again, to ask a question, that is star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.	Brad Heffern	Morning everyone. Uzi, just as a follow-on to Paul’s question earlier, I’m curious if you’ve seen any change or degradation in the quality of the Midland barrels that you’re getting, and I’m also curious how much control you guys have over that.	Uzi Yemin	Brad, good morning. Thanks for the question. The first one, yes, we do. The crude is getting lighter and we are seeing lighter and lighter crudes coming in. That’s a concern to us. As a follow-up to the answer I believe we gave earlier, we believe that having the Big Spring hub, if you will, and having our gathering which we gather already close to 65,000 barrels in West Texas but we put it in different pipes, should help us dramatically. So one of the reasons to think about controlling our logistics assets in regard to the Permian is controlling not only the fees that are being paid but also controlling the quality of the barrels that we are getting.	Brad Heffern	Okay, got it. Then I think historically, you guys did some capital projects at both refineries to try and make it so you could run a lighter crude slate. Is there more to do on that front if we continue to see this lightening of the common stream?	Uzi Yemin	I’ll let Fred take that one. Fred, what do you think?	Fred Green	Yes Brad, we’re in reasonably good shape with respect to the lighter material. We would need to do a little bit of additional kind of de-bottlenecking, if you will, in some of the light naphtha treating units and in the crude overhead, but it’s nominal work.	Brad Heffern	Okay, I’ll leave it there. Thanks.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of Fernando Valle with Citi. Your line is open.	Fernando Valle	Hi guys, good morning. Just curious on--Assi mentioned the wholesale margins and impact of RINs. Also wondering what you guys see as the impact of recent consolidation, particularly in the southwest region, on wholesale and retail margins, and how the integration of the Alon [indiscernible] business, wholesale business will go with Tyler.	Uzi Yemin	Okay, so first one in terms of consolidation in the marketplace in regard to wholesale and retail, we think that while last year was a wonderful, wonderful year for retail because of the RINs, and obviously wholesale enjoyed that as well, this year may be a little more challenging for these industries. So in terms of consolidation, I would say--we always say that in order to create consolidation, you need two conditions in this order: first, the ego of the CEO; and second, money. With these two conditions, if they are being fulfilled, then we will see more consolidation on the retail and the wholesale side.	In terms of connecting Tyler to the Alon wholesale, I must say, without getting into too much information that I cannot disclose, is that the Big Spring refinery is integrated completely with Alon’s wholesale and retail, so if there is anything about Tyler, it’s very little to support the Alon wholesale. It may be on the other side of that just a bit, but for the most part, that’s not substantial versus the situation that exists today.	Fernando Valle	Okay, great. Thanks guys.	Operator	There are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the conference back over to our presenters.	Uzi Yemin	I would like to thank my colleagues around the table. I’d like to thank our board of directors for the continued support they give us. Obviously I’d like to thank you guys and the investors for the confidence in us. We don’t take it lightly. Mostly I’d like to thank our employees who make this company what it is.	Have a great day. We’ll talk to you in the future.	Operator	This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

17,"ONE Gas, Inc (NYSE:OGS)",RIO,Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call,"February 23, 2017 11:00 ET","Executives	Andrew Ziola - Investor Relations	Curtis Dinan - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer	Pierce Norton - President and Chief Executive Officer	Analysts	Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo	Operator	Good day and welcome to the ONE Gas Fourth Quarter Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead.	Andrew Ziola	Good morning. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. After prepared remarks from our speakers, we would be happy to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONE Gas expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Curtis Dinan, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of ONE Gas. Curtis?	Curtis Dinan	Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Net income for the fourth quarter 2016 was $42.3 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared with $39.2 million or $0.74 per diluted share for the same period last year. Investments made in our systems led to new rates, including the effect of the Oklahoma rate case and various other various rate filings in Texas over the past year. Residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas also led to our positive results.	Operating costs for the fourth quarter were higher compared with the same period last year, reflecting an increase in environmental remediation expenses, outside services and IT expenses partially offset by lower employee-related expenses. Last month, the ONE Gas Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, an increase of $0.07, or 20% compared with the previous dividend of $0.35 per share. As a reminder, our targeted dividend payout ratio range is 55% to 65%. Full year 2016 net income was $140 million or $2.65 per diluted share compared with $119 million or $2.24 per diluted share for 2015. In 2016, our results were impacted positively by new rates and residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas. We averaged 12,000 more customers in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 0.6% compared with 2015. Operating costs overall were relatively flat in 2016 compared with 2015.	In mid-January, we announced our 2017 earnings per share guidance of $2.87 to $3.07 per share, with an expected earned ROE of 8.1% compared with 7.7% earned in 2016. The improvement in ROE is primarily attributable to our recently completed rate cases. With our updated capital plan, in which we spend more than two times depreciation, we expect our regulatory lag to average approximately 100 basis points. Also included in that announcement in January, we updated our 5-year net income and EPS guidance to a range of 5% to 7% annually between 2016 and 2021. Our previous guidance focused on 2015 to 2020, which included a growth rate of 5% to 8%. With 2016 EPS increasing by 18%, our outlook for 2020 and 2021 is in line with our previous estimate.	At December 31, 2016, our current authorized rate base, defined as the rate base established in our latest regulatory proceedings, including full rate cases and interim rate filings, was approximately $2.9 billion. Considering additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that have occurred since those regulatory filings, we project that our rate base in 2017 will average approximately $3.1 billion, with 41% of that being our rate base in Oklahoma, 32% in Kansas and 27% in Texas.	Our capital expenditure guidance for 2017 is $350 million, with more than 70% targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. Our 5-year capital plan is expected to be in the range of $350 million to $380 million annually, which is an increase from our previous range of $305 million to $325 million. The primary driver of this revised plan is a continued focus on acceleration of pipe replacement and system integrity projects.	And now, I will turn it over to Pierce Norton, ONE Gas President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce?	Pierce Norton	Thanks, Curtis and good morning everyone. As we began our fourth year of being a standalone publicly traded company, approximately 95% of our rate base has completed a full rate case review, the results of which have positively impacted our 2016 results and have been incorporated into our 2017 and 5-year guidance.	2016 began with new rates in Oklahoma, our first full rate case in Oklahoma since becoming a standalone company. In Kansas, we reached a settlement with the Kansas Corporation Commission last fall, with new rates being implemented January 1, 2017. This was also the first rate case in Kansas since the separation and the first full rate case to go into effect since January 2013. In Texas, we consolidated several jurisdictions during the past year and have reduced the number of our jurisdictions to 6 from 10. During 2016, we completed rate cases in our new Gulf Coast, Central Texas consolidated, and West Texas jurisdictions.	We remain focused on being a premier natural gas distribution company, with safety continuing to be our top priority. We are committed to reinvesting in our systems, as evidenced by our updated 5-year capital guidance of $350 million to $380 million per year, providing this safe and reliable natural gas service our customers expect. We will continue evaluating our distribution system by utilizing a risk-based analysis to further strengthen our ability to make data-driven decisions about pipeline and facilities replacements continuing to spend capital prudently to lower the risk in our systems.	As I previously mentioned, during our first 3 years, our regulatory activity included 95% of our rate base going through a full rate case review. As we move forward, specifically for 2017, we will have an annual PBRC filing in Oklahoma, a GSRS filing in Kansas, and in Texas, a rate case in the Rio Grande Valley, and COSAs or GRIP filings in the other jurisdictions. We will also remain focused on leveraging technology and improving our processes to become more efficient as an organization in order to reduce cost to sustainable levels.	I would like to now take this opportunity to thank our 3,400 employees for what they do everyday. I continue to be proud of their dedication and commitment to meeting the needs of our customers, so they can enjoy the benefits of natural gas.	Operator, we are now ready for questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Sarah Akers of Wells Fargo.	Sarah Akers	Hey, good morning.	Pierce Norton	Good morning, Sarah.	Sarah Akers	I think I heard that ongoing lag is estimated to be about 100 basis points and that compares to the prior expectation of about 100 to 150 bps. So, can you just talk about the improvement that you have been seeing to tighten that expected lag?	Curtis Dinan	Hi, Sarah. This is Curtis. So, a couple of things occurring there. As you recall, when we separated, we had the stay-out provision in the State of Kansas where we could not have any new rates go into effect until 1/1/2017 outside of the normal or the annual GSRS filings. And so we completed that rate case, reached a settlement with the Commission last fall and those new rates did go into effect January 1 of this year. So as Pierce was describing, we have now had all of our – or about 95% of our rate base go through these different filings, so that’s really caught us up so to speak, to reduce from that 100 basis points to 150 basis points, closer to around 100 basis points. So, we will continue to file our interim filings, whether those are PBRCs in Oklahoma, it’s the GRIP filings and COSAs in Texas, it’s the GSRS filings in Kansas or rate cases up there. So, it’s just more of the same continuing as we go.	Sarah Akers	Got it. And then the ‘17 guidance, is that a performance-based rate adjustment in Oklahoma or are you still earning within that ROE band, where it doesn’t trigger an increase?	Curtis Dinan	We are in the process of completing that filing and we will make that here in the first quarter and we will just have to wait until we get to that point.	Sarah Akers	Got it. Thanks a lot.	Curtis Dinan	Thank you.	Pierce Norton	Thanks, Sarah.	Operator	[Operator Instructions] And we have no additional questions. I will turn the call back to Mr. Ziola for any additional or closing comments.	Andrew Ziola	Alright. Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends until we release earnings in early May. We will provide details on the conference call at a later date. We look forward to seeing many of you at some upcoming investor conferences next week. Other than that, have a great rest of your day. Thank you.	Operator	And that does conclude our call today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Sir, you may now begin.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our webcast and conference call. Thank you all for joining us to discuss both our 2016 and fourth quarter results.	In 2016, we reached at an important milestone with the startup S11D project, the largest mining complex in our history with a nominal capacity of 90 million tons per year and average ferrous content of 66.7%. The completion of S11D is a landmark in the mining industry as it presents technology with low cost, high productivity operations. Moreover, the complex is a clear statement of Vale's ability to make things happen.	For 2017, we stand firm in our pursuit at significantly lower net debt while we conclude our investment cycle and prepare the foundations for (03:26) strong free cash flow generation from 2017 onwards.	First, our financial and operational performance, I'm proud to report that Vale delivered a sound operational performance in 2016 with annual production records in iron ore, copper, nickel, cobalt, and gold. Our adjusted EBITDA in 2016 amounted $12.200 billion.	In 2016, we achieved for the fourth consecutive year a reduction of $1.8 billion in cost and expenses, with Brazilian real depreciating on average by only 4% in 2016. Costs decreased by 6% our general, sales, and administrative expenses decreased by over 24%.	Our research and development expenses decreased by 28% and our pre-operating and stoppage expenses decreased by roughly 50%. We also regard that decrease in capital expenditures with a big reduction of $2.9 billion in our investments, from $8.4 billion to $5.5 million in 2016. The S11D project started up successfully in December 2016 with deferred shipment in January 2017. In line with our divestment plan, we announced that asset sales of more than $3.8 billion in 2016, including sale part of the Fertilizers business for $2.5 billion, another gold stream transaction for $820 million. This sale of three very large carriers for about $270 million, for capesize vessels for $140 million, and received an additional payment for the sale of Paragominas for $113 million. That amounted $25.1 billion by the end of the year, a decrease of hopefully $900 million when compared with the third quarter of 2016.	The pace of decrease should accelerate as the sales registered in November and December month with higher price are collected in the first quarter of 2017. Our forecast remains only strengthening our balance sheet while maintain our commitment to shareholders return and net debts (06:35). In that regard, we paid out BRL 857 million of shareholder remuneration in 2016, and we'll pay now BRL 4.667 billion, subject to our general shareholders meeting at end of April.	Vale reported a net income of about $4 billion in 2016. This is a great improvement from a net loss of $12.1 billion in 2015, as a result of higher EBITDA, higher gains on foreign exchange, and monetary valuation and lower impairment.	EBITDA from Ferrous Minerals increased 70.8% (07:27) in 2016, reaching almost $10.5 billion, mainly driven by higher prices and gain (07:38).	Our EBITDA breakeven landed in China for iron ore and pellet decreased by five point – $5.07 per ton to $28.9 per ton in 2016, when compared to 2015 leading to the higher EBITDA margin of $30.50 per ton in 2016.	Base Metals adjusted EBITDA amounted $1.8 billion representing an increase of 33% comparing with 2015, mainly due to the lower costs and expenses and higher volumes despite lower base metals prices. Base Metals EBITDA increased by 14% in 2016 when compared to 2013 – 2015, despite the lower nickel and copper price of 36% and 34%.	Salobo's EBITDA was $736 million, an increase of $135 million when compared to 2015, mainly to higher volumes. Salobo achieved a yearly production record of 175,900 tons in 2016, after completing its ramp-up and reaching nominal capacity as of September 2016.	Vale New Caledonia continues to improve despite of its few negative EBITDA of close U$170 million. EBITDA improved by $240 million when compared to the previous year.	With Coal – with Coal, we saw an important improvement. Coal EBITDA improved, increasing by $450 million from negative $508 million in 2015 to negative $54 million in 2016. As a result of the ramp-ups of the Nacala Logistics Corridor and the Moatize II plant and the strong increase in coal prices.	Adjusted EBITDA of coal shipped through the Nacala port reached $110 million in 2016. Production cost per ton of coal shipped through the Nacala port decreased by $21 per ton to $77 per ton in the beginning of this year, compared with the $98 per ton recorded in the latter fourth quarter 2016, as a result of the increasing production and ramp-up of the Nacala Logistics Corridor.	This week, Vale announced a proposal to transform value into two corporations (10:54) with different control and the adoption of the best practices of corporate governance. This is a historic opportunity for Vale, a milestone that may be as important as the company's privatization 20 years ago. We view proposal as a big step towards implementing a world-class governance and creation of value to our shareholders.	Thank you for your attention. And, now, let's open this webcast for your questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.	Carlos F. De Alba - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Yeah. Good morning. Very strong performance. Congratulations. Just wanted to ask two questions. And Murilo, maybe with the balance sheet in fast repair mode (12:02), surprisingly strong iron ore prices Vale has that you would like to turn into a dividend paying company for all the excess the company might generate?	Right now, there is not really specific dividend policy all around the company law (12:22) required dividend of 25% on net income. Do you think that the company could turn or could come out with a more precise, maybe higher payout ratio and state in a dividend policy going forward?	And my second question, maybe for Peter, is if he could comment as to how the ramp-up of S11D is likely to progress this year and next year, and any particular comments as to how the production ramp-up achieved out of S11D are going, that will be very useful. Thank you.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Carlos, thank you. I think that we have learned in the super (13:08) cycle that just in case, and I am saying about in our long-term, at least the medium- to long-term perspective, we should just involve in world-class projects. Then in case of not having these long-term projects, Vale should be completely devoted to increase dividends policy. But we cannot be precise, because we needed (13:36) to see, in annually basis, what should be done in order to increase the value of the company.	I strongly believe in that Vale will be one of the highest payout in the mining sector in the whole stock exchange, but we think that it's very early to provide some comments. Our priority in 2017, for sure, is to reduce our leverage. Thank you.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Carlos, thanks for the question. The ramp-up of Carajás is going well. In the last 30 days or so, we produce or expect around 1 million (14:23) tons. There is no major issues where we have the still stop and go (14:25) operations because we have to do some adjustments, which is normal. As you saw maybe its 85% physical progress, on average, we have 97 million tons (14:38) in the mine and 67 million tons (14:39) in logistics and infrastructure.	No major issues, like I said; trucks is still being commissioned in some parts and the whole system in 2017 will do 175 million tons – I mean, the S11D plus the Northern range. Maybe, we can -depending on how the ramp-up goes, we can reduce a little bit pressure on the Northern range and increase in S11D or vice versa. What we will do is to check what makes best economic sense.	Today, the bottleneck view (15:17) is the logistics. So we have 175 million tons, on total, to ship. And the complete ramp-up, as you may recall, we have – one year ago, we have revised the ramp-up and it was best for – make more economic sense to do it in the ramp-up in four years instead of in two years. And that is still the plan and we will be ready to have a full capacity after four years. Thank you very much.	Operator	Our next question comes from Jon Brandt with HSBC.	Jonathan Brandt - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.	Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the results and thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to ask about iron ore prices and the fact that they are much higher than what everybody thought. I'm wondering if that changes your mining plan where before, you were very vocal about only producing – or not producing sort of your less profitable volumes. With iron ore above $90, I'm sure everything that you have is very profitable. So has that strategy changed at all? And I'm thinking more from the South and Southeast systems, are you going to start the producing as much as you can?	And then sort of the second part to that question, have you noticed or are you expecting any restarts from some of the higher cost countries like China and India, and sort of what does that mean for your 2018 supply/demand outlook?	And then secondly, I'm just wondering if there's an update on Samarco, if you're still expecting a potential restart in 2017, or if we should only expect a Samarco restart next year. Thanks.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Thank you, Jon, I will relate with (17:12) Peter. But for sure, what we have in mind permanently in Vale is to maintain to keep our discipline in the supply side. Peter.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Thanks, Jon. Regarding the iron ore prices, what we see for 2017, in a nutshell, would be, we see a much higher demand for several reasons than we had in 2016 – steel demand, I mean that translates into iron ore demand, steel prices and everything. What we also see is that there is much less new supply coming into the system than it was the case in 2016.	And finally, we see a completely imbalanced stocks, the ratio between high-grade and low-grade sitting in China is imbalanced, which will probably mean an additional demand pull of equivalent of more than 5% what China imports. So from that perspective, I think we have a very strong 2007 team ahead of us.	We see the – the question you asked me about how – are people coming back. We don't think it's so easy, so immediate, the elasticity is not there so easily. What we have seen is in China, for instance, for environmental reasons and also for quality discounts which translates into cost, the breakeven is, if you add sustaining, is probably higher than $70, $75. That's sort of the floor.	And the same applies to the seaborne supply, the extra supply where you have seen huge discounts in terms of quality, which also translates into higher cost. So the whole cost curve have shifted a little to the right and is now much more steeper than it was in the past. And I don't see – really I don't see average prices below $70, probably more in the 80s in 2017.	Regarding if we change our mine plan, we will not change our mine plan. What we have said is we are committed. We have a new long-term target. We have a capacity of 450 million tons but we have a long-term target of – a base case target, which is 400 million tons, which we expect to achieve the pace (20:04) of 400 million end of 2018.	And it is the fact that if you look into 2018 now and you analyze all the possible supply coming in from the majors, and so you see that actually in 2018, it's 50% coming from Vale. And certainly Vale will not be the one to derail the supply/demand equilibrium. We are looking for maximization of our margins and that's what we believe in. So it is 400 million unchanged and we will closely watch what happens in 2018, since it's more than 50% our ore coming into the market in 2018. Thank you.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Jon, regarding Samarco for sure, (21:00) to get the environment permit, it's out of our control. What we can say that Samarco is doing everything in the right way. We believe that we'd say, they have already (21:15) delivered everything to have the new permit to the Alegria Cave. They need us to get again the same what used to be in the existing facilities. I could say that it's very realist (21:33) to consider Samarco going back to the operations in the third quarter of this year. But for sure, I repeat, it's not something that we can have a nice (21:47) statement, because it's completely out of our control. But what should be done has been done. Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson.	Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC	Yeah. Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit about inventories. First – my first question, can you guys give us a sense of sort of where Vale's inventories are across the whole system, maybe compared to this time last year?	And then I think you touched on – second question is, you touched on high-grade inventories being much different than lower grade inventories in China. Again, can you maybe give us a sense of order of magnitude? I think overall inventories at port are probably up 25 million to 30 million tons year-over-year. I'm curious, kind of, where you see high-grade inventories year-over-year. Thank you.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Well, thanks, Jeremy. It's Peter speaking. In terms of Vale's products in iron ore, we have reduced our inventories from last year, from 2015 to 2016, by roughly 2 million to 3 million tons. At the same time, our inventories they have shifted downstream. They are less concentrated in the mine now and more in the ports. So we have actually blended – last year, we have blended roughly 40 million (23:29) tons. So in spite of the additional blending last year, we have reduced inventories and inventories have shifted downstream.	Regarding the inventories sitting in Chinese ports is around kind of 20 million tons, and there are several sources, there are several ports. There is analyst reports, we have our own market intelligence and it's a fact that the high-grade ores are very low have very low inventories. The medium grades are a little higher inventories, and the low-grades are really increasing dramatically. So that's a fact.	And this means that you cannot use, if you would use all the inventories into one single – let's say in one single (24:30) you would not be able to make a good quality of steel at all out of it – pig iron out of it. So it must be said that yes, stocks, inventories have increased in China, but part of them are actually so to say sterilized (24:47), they cannot be used and they have to be probably used in a very, very long time down the road. Thank you.	Operator	Our next question comes from Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank.	Alfonso Salazar - Scotia Inverlat Casa de Bolsa SA de CV	Hello, thank you and congratulations on the results for the full year. The question I have is regarding cost. We saw an increase in the quarter, it was in part related to labor, but also there is a stronger Brazilian real today. So I was just wondering if you can give us some guidance on what to expect in terms of costs for 2017? And how the cost is going to be impacted by the S11D ramp-up this year?	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Yes, Alfonso, thank you for your question. Yes, the cost in the fourth quarter has increased a little bit. In the freight, it was the bunker, you saw that it was exactly the effect of the higher bunker. And in the C1, there is mainly a non-recurrent cost increase where we had some stocks adjustments, but also we have some provisions for variable remuneration and also the deal with the unions for the wages for this year. So, that is mainly the reason why the costs have increased. If you compare the costs in the fourth quarter, the C1, and compare it to last year's fourth quarter, it's in reais, it's more or less in line what we had then.	Looking forward, I don't expect in 2017 to have a big effect of S11D, given that we will still be in ramp-up. But what I can tell you is that we are working on, in the next two to three years, what we will have is, yes, there will be $1 or so less in C1, due to the effect of S11D, I mean, diluted in the whole Vale. You will have another dollar coming from our global recovery. Remember that we are more and more dry processing instead of wet processing, and reducing our strip ratio not because we are leaving ore behind, but because we are actually using former (27:50) waste and now processing it in our (27:54) projects, that's another dollar.	And then you would probably go for $2 or so when the whole supply chain is completely integrated and optimized, which is not the case today, we have the efficiency piece where we can still work on and we have the price realization piece. So we are saying roughly $4 a ton down the road in two or three years, compared to the 2016 costs. Of course, depending a little bit – in the C1 case, depending a little bit on the exchange rate, which is now a little against us, but that's the order of magnitude I would indicate.	Operator	Our next question comes from Christian Georges with SocGén.	Christian Eric Andre Georges - Société Générale SA (UK)	Yes, hi, thank you. I just have a couple of questions. One of them is on your coal production in Mozambique, if you could update us on what you're looking at in terms of production at Moatize next year. I think I saw that Moatize II will be in action in this quarter, but I suspect it's only going to be happening perhaps in the second half. So, if you could give us some detail,	And just I'm not sure if I missed in your comment, but you're mentioning that you want net debt to reduce further, do you have any kind of target of where net debt should be ideally in the coming 12 months? Thank you.	Roger Allan Downey - Vale SA	Good morning. It's Roger here. We are ramping up the Moatize II plant. I think we're going well. We're targeting a 13 million to 14 million ton production this year as we ramp up. We had a very good January, which has boosted our confidence in terms of achieving that goal.	Obviously, there is always a challenge, but all the systems are doing very well, both the mine, the plant, and the Nacala Railway and Port. So, we're on target.	Unknown Speaker	Christian, as regards net debt, we do have a target to reach $15 billion to $17 billion of net debt. This can be achieved over the next 12 months depending on prices, but even in a scenario of lowering prices, we are very confident that we will achieve this in the near term, helped also not only by the increased cash flow of the company, but also by the divestitures of Fertilizers and Coal.	Important to note is that one of the reasons behind the increased cash flow generation of the company is not only higher prices, not only higher volumes, and reduced costs, which are already reflected on the results you're seeing, but also lower investments, that's very important, so freeing up more cash, and lower expenditures with the derivatives.	For example, in 2016, we had a lot to spend on settling open positions in bunker hedge. And also we had a toll (31:25) also because of the appreciation of the Brazilian real on the accounts of the currency hedge. So all of those drags on cash flow they have been cleared. So therefore, even in an environment of very low prices, deleveraging should be a reality going forward very quickly.	Operator	The next question comes from Daniel Lurch with BNP Paribas.	Daniel Lurch - Exane BNP Paribas	Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Just two quick questions on Base Metals. The first one is on capital allocation. You were posting obviously very considerable costs (32:04) in iron ore and should, as you mentioned, consider to (32:07) decrease your net debt in 2017?	I understand your focus on balance sheet and shareholder returns but could outline your thinking about (32:16) outside iron ore? I'm thinking, particularly about over three-year. (32:20) It appears this could (32:22-32:26) and in terms of timing, what do you think – when would you start considering this investment?	And the second question with regard to Base Metals, how do you think will cash costs develop in 2017, given the changes you are planning in Sudbury in Canada? Thank you very much.	Jennifer Anne Maki - Vale SA	On the unit cash costs, when you look at the Canadian unit cash costs in 2017, it will be slightly increased as 2017 is a year of transition. We go down on March 15 with one of the furnaces that will be rebuilt, and it will be down until we come back up in July. And in June, the whole surface plants in Sudbury are shutdown for the annual maintenance that happens every 18 months. We didn't have that maintenance in 2016, so it's an additional $60 million and a loss of four weeks of productions out of the refinery in Sudbury.	As well as highly necessary this year, because we'll also be doing the tie-ins for our Atmospheric Emissions Reduction project and we come back up on July 1. And at the end of Q3, beginning of Q4, we'll move to one furnace in Sudbury permanently, and that one furnace, albeit, will have an expanded capacity. The long-term reduction in (33:53) production out of Sudbury is about 25%, but next year it will be probably about 7% down.	So with the combination of higher maintenance costs and lower production because of the downtime, there is increasing costs in 2017. And also as you ramp up Long Harbour and its contributing more until it gets fully ramped up. But we have, in parallel, action plans to return ourselves and to reduce fixed cost consistent with the reduction in production as we move forward into 2018 and 2019.	In terms of the capital, from a Base Metals perspective in the next few years, we have to finish the Atmospheric Emissions Reduction program in Sudbury. But then we have to turn our attention to investment in the mines. Predominantly in Sudbury, we have a Copper Cliff mine expansion project there that we will begin this year, which will increase the mine feed in Sudbury in the years going forward. But I would say it's predominantly focused on mine investment in Canada, the CapEx program over the next few years.	Operator	The next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.	Andreas Bokkenheuser - UBS Securities LLC	Thank you very much for taking my question and also congratulation on the solid set of results. Just one clarification on the balance sheet, obviously, you've seen net leverage per EBITDA come down quite significantly, can you update us on your target on your deleveraging process? I mean, initially, I think you were mentioning $15 billion to $17 billion in 18 months. Obviously, EBITDA is driving down the multiple but the actual absolute number seems unchanged with net debt still around $25 billion. What's your timeline to get it down to $15 billion? That would be my first question.	And my second question just on the ramp-up at S11D, as you also mentioned on the Portuguese call this morning, Vale certainly is going to go in and imbalance the market, which is certainly understandable. I guess my question is hypothetically speaking, if you did want to ramp up S11D within the initial 24-month period, which I understand is now four years, but if you did want to ramp it up in 24 months, could you do that or are you constrained on the Railway? Thank you very much. Those are my two questions.	36.38: Andreas, on the debt, the 18-month target was established when we did the same results call one year ago, and we were talking about the end of 2017 and we put down this 18-month target. Most recently, we have stated that we don't intend to do any further divestitures rather than Fertilizers and Coal. We were considering beforehand to do perhaps another larger transaction within our core asset base. So given the improved cash flows, we have put this out of the table. So therefore, we're working only with Coal and Fertilizer as the key divestitures, which together, with the prevailing cash flows, probably take this timeline to the end of this year. Obviously, that depends on the average prices for the year.	But nevertheless, even if we are wrong on prices, we're just talking about taking another three months, worst-case scenario, another six months, to say that it is very likely that we will reach that $15 billion to $17 billion target by the end of the year, so we continue to go in that direction.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Yes, Andreas, thank you for the question on the ramp-up, but it's like I said before, we have decided to go for four years. Yes, we could, a little bit, we could speed it up. But we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that because we have a very well structured profile now, ramp-up profile. And our expansion of the Railway is following a very well defined system. And also, we don't want to change that. And that's the answer. So we don't want to change this four years ramp-up.	Operator	The next question comes from John Tumazos with Very Independent Research (sic) [John Tumazos Very Independent Research] (38:55).	John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC	Thank you very much for the nice dividends and great performance, and good job. First issue, dredge (39:09) individual tributaries, you must have rebuilt a lot of houses by now. How are the actual costs coming versus projections? And second, is it a practical goal to buy out BHP in Samarco so it can be integrated into one company and a more streamlined decision-making structure?	Unknown Speaker	About the potential acquisition of Samarco, John, I think that it's something that it's out of the contest at this stage. We believe that our priority is to reduce our leverage. And my understanding that BHP is very committed with the whole process, into the river, in the region and mainly going back with Samarco (40:10). I think that the subject that we have on the table is precisely just to go back and to work as should be. We know that we can reach the level of 70% of the nominal capacity, but it must be a very important milestone to Samarco to pay its debt, and to go ahead with all the obligations. Peter.	Unknown Speaker	(40:49) John, on the costs on the Samarco recovery, they're pretty much in line what was expected when we drafted the original agreement by March last year. We've been obviously updating and getting more comfort with the numbers but the good news is that they are adhering very much to what has been outlined a year ago.	And just to say that also we flew over the river very recently and the progress of the remediation work is amazing. I would say that – we would say that in a very short time, we will be very proud – we already are, we would be very proud of what we're delivering to the communities in terms of remediation.	Operator	The next question comes from David Wang with Morningstar.	David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)	Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the dynamics for supply and demand going forward. I know previously you mentioned on the call that a lot of the new supply will be coming from Vale, but I'm wondering with the higher pricing, are you seeing a lot of other smaller players wanting to reenter the market because they would be profitable as well? And what's your, I guess, longer term outlook on the sustainability of the sort of credit fueled boom in demand that we saw last year.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	David, hi. So the supply and demand and about other players coming back, well, I already said that we have a better demand than last year. We have less new supply this year coming in than last year and we have imbalanced stocks. This means a very strong environment for our enterprises (42:49). I don't see the prices at all. The players coming back either being Chinese mines or seaborne because the cost curve has shifted. It's not only about cost anymore, it's now really about quality. This translates into a huge discount and translates into additional cost. So that is distinctly higher than $70, this breakeven, $70 – including some sustaining – $70, which is sort of natural floor, sort of limit. And then the other one (43:33) we believe they don't come back eagerly and (43:37) quickly because there are environmental restrictions more and more in China. And it's just not so elastic like we have seen in the past.	So in terms of the longer term, there is also the depletion issue. Lots of them will face huge depletion issues and I don't see them coming back easily. They may come back a little bit, but it's not from one day to the other. That's my call here.	Operator	The next question comes from Jamie Nicholson with Credit Suisse.	Jamie Eileen Nicholson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)	Hi, thanks so much for the call. Just quickly, given your comments on strong net debt reduction, do you expect to continue with liability management on your bonds and buyback, some additional bond debt? And if so, would you be focusing on the higher coupon debt or the near-term maturities, or what objectives would you be looking to achieve? Thank you.	Unknown Speaker	Well, we just did one example of what you're mentioning. The bond that we issued a few weeks ago, we announced yesterday that we are repurchasing the eurobond which matures in 2018. So, yes, we look forward to continue to do a liability management which doesn't mean that we will keep accessing the markets. We have other alternatives outside of the capital markets to do liability management. But it's good to use this nice window in terms of lowering costs of that in order to refinance part of the maturities.	We did, in our view, a good job last year by cleaning up 2017. We have only $1 billion of major – mostly in ages, it's (45:31) maturing this year and we now have the task to push forward the maturities of 2018 and 2019, which will happen simultaneously at debt reduction. And now, we don't have a clear preference. There are some high coupon debt over the longer term. Should the cash flows surprise on the upside, we should also remove some of those high-coupon debt. But the priority over the short term still is to refinance shorter-time maturities.	Operator	[Foreign Language] (46:11-46:14) Our next question comes from [ph] Tiago Silva (46:16) of Citibank.	Unknown Speaker	Hi, thanks for the question. I would like to get, if you can provide, what is your expectations on pellet productions for this year and next year? And regarding Moatize, I know that you mentioned briefly on to 2017 production, but what is the expectation about the expansion to 22 million tons? Thank you.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Hi, Tiago (46:45). Thanks for the question. Pellet production this year, we will have higher production than we had last year; so, probably coming close to 50 million tons. But the pellet production is, of course, one of our competitive advantages and we will do everything in this current environment to increase production without the jeopardizing the quality. We are even considering controlling options around the world where we provide the pellet feed and get back to pellets. So, pellets will be – and by the way, the pellet – the new pellet price, which in the previous call was, why it didn't reflect in the fourth quarter, this will kick in only in the first quarter of this year. And you will see the effect this year.	So, it will be increased, the production. And we also announced the São Luís pellet plant restart (47:48). This will only happen in first half of 2018 since we have to do some works there. And the rationale is actually really that we have this plant there. What changed from the past is that we have now the logistic infrastructure. We have not infrastructure at that time. So, we have to make a choice between selling sinter feed and grinding sinter feed for the pellet plant.	Now, we have the infrastructure with the logistics taking. And also, what we are doing in São Luís is we are going to recover pellets feed from tailing dams where we have huge tailing dams, which will be reutilized. There is no concentration needed, just cycloning and getting this pellets feed ready to be pelletized with minimum of grinding.	And so, this is a very good case – a very nice case in terms of sustainability of the region, but also about making use of the resources we have. And the plan is to make blast furnace pellets and to swap some of the blast furnace pellets from the Tubarão plant into this São Luís plant and to create more space – make space available in the Tubarão plant for increase in the production of the direct reduced iron (49:14) segment, which is the segment really growing in the world in the next years. Thank you.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Okay. Downey, please.	Roger Allan Downey - Vale SA	Hi. Good afternoon. We are ramping up in tandem with the railway, expecting to reach 18 million tons next year, followed by 19, 20 million tons in 2019. After that, it really depends on the market. We will be obviously going to be disciplined and sensible about how we move towards any bigger targets. Obviously, with some investments, the market can (49:57) even go to 30 million tons. It's just a matter of what the model looks like and how the investments pay out. Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Thiago Lofiego with Bradesco BBA.	Thiago Lofiego - Bradesco SA CTVM	Thank you, gentlemen. I have two follow-up questions. One is, Peter, why do you think swing capacity is not coming back online, at least, not in a massive way for now? What do you think are factors behind that?	And second question, considering no changes in oil prices from here, where should we expect your average freight rates to stabilize? You still have higher priced contracts majoring (50:46), that should be replaced by lower priced ones, I mean, just to understand the dynamics. Thank you.	Gerd Peter Poppinga - Vale SA	Regarding on the freight, once the second-generation volume of the shipments, once they kicked in, it will be (51:05) more than 30 ships; as you know, $3.5 more competitive than the first generation. And once we have rebalanced our portfolio, I would say, at a bunker of BRL 250 million (51:16) – based on BRL 250 million (51:18), I would say that we should come close to $11 (51:21) in the midterm. That's our average portfolio, which is, of course, lower than what we have today, but it really depends on how we can rebalance our spot contracts. (51:49).	The other question was on why would they not come back – the margin of supplies? Well, they will, but it's a question of – in China, for instance, what you're seeing is more and more environmental restrictions, lots of mines reluctant to come back, lots of strict controls. And as I said, the breakeven on, truly on the cost basis, even if they got – they've got the recent tax incentive. But even with that, if you check the average, the average breakeven cost is $64, $65 including the sustaining.	And if you're now at the quality plus those concentrates, they have 6%, 7% silicon average. But now, (52:44) is coming back, they would have 8%, 9% silicon. And this is in today's market conditions, with today's coal price is very difficult and translates into another $5, $6, $7 (52:58) penalties. So, we are talking $75 (53:03), which is, today, possible. We are higher in C1, but it is – the reluctance that we see, it is also the elasticity, which is not there. And lots of those are actually underground, which is not easy to restart a mine like that from one day to the other. That's why we think it's not from one day to other.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Just to add one further comment, we needed the attention. As you know, just recently, we have learned about eventually the government cannot allow to mine coal in some provinces. We must pay attention; we can see some chance not allowing iron ore as well. Thank you.	Operator	The next question comes from Marcos Assumpção with Itaú BBA.	Marcos Assumpção - Itaú Corretora de Valores SA	Sorry. Can you hear me?	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	Yeah. Go ahead.	Marcos Assumpção - Itaú Corretora de Valores SA	Okay, okay. Sorry. I have a question on coal. You mentioned on the press release that as the Chinese mines will be able to get back to the 330 days of production per year, the market could get back to equilibrium. So, if you could mention what is the equilibrium level that you're expecting?	And also, when we take a look at the Sena-Beira, the profitability of the Sena-Beira Corridor, we see that it's actually much, much lower than the one for Nacala. So, for how long will you still have like the take-or-pay contracts for Sena-Beira? And – so, we should see some lower profitability in this corridor. And so, if you could comment a bit of the volumes that you have to carry on, on that corridor would be nice.	And last question on iron ore, we're seeing some talks about the Simandou being sold to Chinalco. If by any chance this is confirmed, as you know the project very well, how long do you think it would take to put a project like that in place? Thank you.	Roger Allan Downey - Vale SA	Hi, Marcos. Good afternoon. I'd just start off with Coal then. We – first, on the market there (55:45), we have seen the coal prices move exactly with the news flow which kind of tells you that the difference between 276 says and 330 days production in China is where the balance lies.	When the 276-day curfew was implemented – and yes, we did have some supply disruptions at the time – coal prices shot up to $300. Since then, with the flex – when they flexed production to threaten 330 days, coal prices started basically to free fall. And now, with the announcement of the resumption of the 276 days curb, they started – they bounced back.	So, what I would say is that – so that's basically – I think we've seen a floor. We've seen where were prices need to be in order to – and when to bend (56:49) to satisfy supply/demand today, and where they will probably remain, at least, over the course this year.	Peter's comments about the steel industry in China and steel prices just corroborate the fact that we're probably going to see the balance lying a bit above where we are today. The other comment that, I think, is worth making in that respect is that because the volatility we saw, especially in the fourth quarter 2016, the buyers, and a lot of those buyers, were left without volume at the end of last year. Probably don't want to see the volatility, and they want to make sure, especially those who are on contracts, want to make sure that have a benchmark price which is sufficient to guarantee their volume. So, we would say that it's probably worth a risk with saying that the first quarter of the Japanese fiscal year starting April 1 will likely to see a benchmark at least (57:54) settled above where the spot market is, which I think is a very good reading for our business.	Regarding your comments on the Beira railway, this is the last year of our take-or-pay contract. Any volumes that we push down Beira now will obviously be in addition to what we can do in Nacala. And Nacala, we will be ramping up towards the 19, 20 million-ton target by 2019. And again, anything above that will be – depends on the market, I mean, where the market is, whether the market needs more coal, and whether we can be competitive through Beira.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	The maturity, or should I think of that business (58:41) third quarter of this year, the maturity of the existing contracts.	Roger Allan Downey - Vale SA	The contracts, yeah, end of this year – end of third quarter.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	And just to answer, Marcos, I think that the level of complexity and having a green light in the Simandou project is very high. As you know the project is facing a huge dispute regarding the past into the court and I think that before anything, it must be decided about the process, BSGR, and to solve some issues.	And regardless of these, I think that's just in the first phase that used to having the Rio Tinto. Hence, I have learned that the cost could be above $20 billion, which is, in our view, (59:43) that can jeopardize the whole project.	But it's very early to say because, first of all, (59:52) regarding the illegal dispute. Thank you very much, Marcos.	Murilo Pinto de Oliveira Ferreira - Vale SA	I would like to say thank you very much for spend your time with us. And we appreciate your questions and all the best. Bye-bye.

Today, we announced 2016 results for the fourth quarter and full year, and provided our expectations for sales and earnings growth in 2017. On a full year basis in 2016, we generated sales essentially in line with our most recent guidance of $2.6 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.51, just above our guidance of $1.48 to $1.50.	Overall, we are pleased to have successfully managed through fairly challenging market conditions for the year and the anticipated headwinds in 2016 that we had initially projected.	We are particularly pleased with the record level of free cash flow we generated in 2016 and the $470 million we were able to return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe next year will be another record year of free cash flow and combined with our confidence in earnings growth, we announced this morning that we will be raising our dividend by 20% for the fifth consecutive year.	We also announced the renewal of our NCIB program to repurchase up to 5% of our outstanding common shares.	In 2016 we completed two acquisitions and earlier this year we successfully emerged as the winner bidder for the American Apparel brand. Confidence in our long-term strategy, cash generating capabilities, and our strong balance sheet continues to place us in an attractive position to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities, including organic growth, acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders.	Now let me take you through our fourth quarter results. Consolidated sales of $588 million were up 8% with increased sales in both segments in the quarter. In the midst of a more challenging retail environment than we anticipated when we reported for Q3.	Our Printwear business performed right on plan with sales increasing more than 14% to $326 million. After excluding the $30 million sales contribution from Alstyle, we were pleased to achieve 4% organic growth in the quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales of fashion basics and double-digit growth in international shipments, offset in part by anticipated lower net selling prices and foreign exchange.	Branded Apparel sales in the quarter totaled $262 million, up just over 1% compared to the fourth quarter last year. The Peds sales contribution of $20 million and positive point of sales growth for our products in the quarter, offset the effects of weak store traffic trends and a weak holiday period, which drove retailers to limit replenishment and manage down inventory levels during the fourth quarter.	In addition, Branded Apparel sales were impacted by the planned exit from certain private label programs. We were very pleased with our ability to grow our market share for the Gildan brand in a tough retail market during the quarter. While point-of-sales for men's socks and men's underwear for the total market were down in the fourth quarter, Gildan unit POS in these categories was up. And, in particular, in men's underwear we continue to see strong double-digit unit POS growth.	Unit market share in men's underwear for the Gildan brand was 9.2% for the December quarter, up 210 basis points compared to December quarter last year. As we moved into January of 2017, we hit and exceeded our 10% market share target in this category with Gildan branded men's underwear attaining a 10.9% market share, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing marketing efforts and new features and reformatted package sizes for our product offerings, as well as expanded distribution.	In the men's socks category, where the Gildan brand holds the number one position, market share for the quarter was 22.1%, up 220 basis points compared to December quarter last year. So as I mentioned, we're very pleased with these market share gains which fundamentally underpin our long-term strategy to grow sales and margins in this business.	Turning back to our consolidated performance, gross margin for the quarter was 26.7%, slightly up versus Q4 2015. The benefits from lower raw material costs and other input costs were largely offset by expected lower Printwear net selling prices. Consolidated operating margins in the quarter of 11.9% were down from 13% in the prior year quarter, mainly as a result of higher marketing and advertising expenses and the impact of SG&A deleveraging in Branded Apparel due to lower sales driven by the unanticipated impact of retailer destocking.	Printwear operating income of $69 million was up 9% compared to last year. The operating margin was 21%, down 90 basis points over the fourth quarter in 2015. Although raw material costs were favorable compared to last year, expected lower net selling prices and currency headwinds as well as the transitional dilutive impact of the Alstyle acquisition offset this benefit.	Finally if we look at the full year, we were pleased with Printwear operating margins of 23.5%, in line with 2015 margins and in line with our original guidance for the year. Branded Apparel operating income was $24 million or 9.1% of sales in the quarter, down from $31 million or 12% in the fourth quarter last year. The decline in operating margin was mainly due to re-timed marketing and advertising expenses and SG&A deleveraging resulting from lower organic sales due to retailer destocking in the period.	For the full year, Branded Apparel's operating margin was 9.1%, up 20 basis points over 2015. At a consolidated level, we generated adjusted diluted EPS of $0.32 in the quarter, above our implied guidance of $0.29 to $0.31, and up 14.3% compared to the fourth quarter in 2015. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to higher gross profit and income tax recovery in the quarter and the benefit of share repurchases during the year, which were partly offset by higher SG&A and financial expenses.	Moving to our strong free cash flow performance, we generated $142 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $43 million or 43% higher than the fourth quarter last year. This resulted in record free cash flow for the full year of $398 million, up 151% over the prior year, driven by higher cash from operating activities including strong working capital management and lower capital expenditures than in 2015. Capital expenditures of approximately $140 million for the year came in slightly lower than our previous projection of approximately $150 million, and included investment towards the ramp-up of the Mocksville facility, development of Rio Nance 6, and capacity expansion in Bangladesh.	During the fourth quarter of 2016, we bought back approximately 1.6 million common shares under our NCIB program for a total cost of approximately $43 million. This brought the total amount of share repurchases for the year to 13.8 million shares at a total cost of $395 million.	Finally, we ended the year with net debt of $562 million and a leverage ratio of one times adjusted EBITDA in line with the leverage framework we put in place at the beginning of 2016.	Now, before I cover our outlook for 2017, I'd like to briefly talk about the American Apparel acquisition. We were pleased to emerge as the successful bidder of the auction with a final bid of $88 million. American Apparel is a strong brand with a premium positioning in the fashion segment in Printwear.	We're confident that we can leverage our deep and extensive distribution network both in North America and internationally to grow the brand and achieve attractive returns on this transaction.	We have quickly begun implementing our integration plans, which include leveraging our manufacturing network, while at the same time working on a supply chain to also support Made in the USA product. As we move through this transitional period, we're leveraging inventory we purchased from American Apparel and have secured contractors in the U.S. to support production.	Now let me cover our guidance for 2017. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70, which at the midpoint of the guidance range represents growth of 9% over 2016 on overall high single-digit sales growth.	Printwear and Branded Apparel sales in 2017 are each expected to increase in the high single-digit range. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 is $555 million to $585 million. Printwear sales growth guidance assumes unit sales volume growth, including continued penetration in the fashion and performance segments of the North American market and double-digit unit sales volume growth in international market.	Printwear sales are also expected to benefit from favorable product mix in 2017, while foreign exchange impacts on international sales are now expected to be unfavorable, primarily related to the weakening of European currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.	While price increases have been implemented in Europe to offset foreign exchange impact, there is typically a temporary misalignment of price increases and changes in foreign exchange.	Projected sales growth in Branded Apparel in 2017 reflects the impact of increased shelf space and new programs based on commitments from retailers, as well as favorable product mix partly offset by the impact of approximately $20 million related to the exit of certain private label programs.	The incremental impact of the acquisition of Alstyle, Peds and American Apparel on adjusted earnings in 2017 is expected to be $0.05 to $0.07 per share on projected incremental sales of approximately $160 million to $185 million. While Peds and Alstyle are expected to be accretive to earnings in 2017, we have conservatively assumed that the impact of American Apparel on earnings will be neutral in 2017, as we ramp-up our supply chain and we will see accretion in 2018.	The positive factors contributing to earnings growth in 2017 are expected to be partly offset by related increases in SG&A expenses and higher income taxes. The company's income tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 5%. We are projecting operating margin expansion in 2017, driven primarily by margin expansion in Branded Apparel.	On the earnings growth profile for the year, we expect earnings growth in 2017 be weighted to the first half of the year with strong earnings growth in the first quarter, in particular. The overall net impact of net selling prices, cost saves – cost savings from capital projects and raw material costs is expected to be neutral to earnings for the year.	The net impact from these factors is projected to be unfavorable in the first half of the year – sorry, is projected to be favorable in the first half of the year and unfavorable in the second half. We will also see the wrap-around impact from the Alstyle and Peds acquisitions in the first half of 2017 as they were completed in the second and third quarters of 2016, respectively.	Moving on to cash flow guidance. We're expecting another record year of free cash flow generation in excess of $400 million. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $125 million for the year, related primarily to investments in textile capacity, including the continued development of the Rio Nance 6 facility in Honduras, capacity expansion in Bangladesh, as well as investments in distribution and selling capacity aligned with increases in textile capacity. Construction of Rio Nance 6 will now be completed by the end of 2017 available to support 2018 sales.	So wrapping up, we were pleased with our performance in 2016, given the challenging environment and are comfortable with the targets we have set for 2017 in this context of current market conditions.	Our outlook for the business remains promising and with our strong free cash flow and balance sheet capacity, we believe we are well-positioned to drive organic growth, pursue complementary acquisitions while at the same time, returning capital to shareholders.	Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Sophie.	Sophie Argiriou - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Thanks, Rhod. That concludes our formal remarks. Before we move to the Q&A session, I ask that you limit the number of questions to two in order to give everyone the opportunity to ask a question and we will circle back for a second round if time permits.	I will now turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer session.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Kenric Tyghe from Raymond James.	Kenric Tyghe - Raymond James Ltd.	Thank you. Good morning. Glenn, just with respect to your outlook what strikes me as absent in the outlook given current cotton, is any discussion around pricing or potential price increases given what has been going on in the cotton markets. Could you speak to your conservatism on the guidance and is it just a reflection of there is no setting of back to school pricing or no real visibility as yet, and it's a little early to be making any determination as yet on how prices settle out?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, like Rhod said in the – his remarks, we have increased prices in Printwear in December, which is – which was a modest price increase really to support our cost of 2017. We do have selective price increases going into effect during the year in Branded as well. And if cotton remains at the level it is today, we will most likely take further action on pricing as we move into 2018, that's the way you should think about it.	Kenric Tyghe - Raymond James Ltd.	Great. Thank you. And then, just on American Apparel. The contract manufacturing and the effect being sort of a net neutral in the year, is that again just a conservative stance given that it is early days and perhaps we should look at that as being something that could be a moving target through the year, how should we be thinking about the American Apparel integration, as we move through the year?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, I think, you are right. I mean, look at it's early days for us. We just recently as couple weeks ago took over the company. We're very excited about it. It's a premier brand in our segment. It really is going to help us to focus in capturing a bigger share of the fashion basics. And it's going to be priced at – it will be our highest price point product line within Gildan. The great news is, is that we're going to leverage our infrastructure and our distribution network in Printwear. The acquisition will be integrated seamlessly into Gildan, and the total integration from order to cash and distribution will be complete within the month of March. So, it should go relatively quickly.	Our big challenge is obviously re-feeding the line and getting the supply line up and running. Customers have brought a lot of inventory, pre-bankruptcy to support the sales, and we should start shipping product towards the end of April and the beginning of May.	So we're excited about it. There, yeah – there could be some potential upside in American Apparel obviously, but it's early days, and we just need to get a little bit more understanding. And we're really excited about the opportunity.	And maybe one last point is that we're still also looking at evaluating our strategy in terms of our consumer strategy. The Printwear strategy is fully implemented, and we have very good visibility on it. But we haven't really defined a 100% our consumer strategy, which we're in the process of doing.	And one last point, I would add out is that where we really see the American Apparel brand opportunity is really also in our international markets. I mean, we have huge interest from all of our international customers to carry this brand. So we think we've again had a great acquisition, and we're really excited about it. And as we get into next quarter, we'll probably have a little bit more understanding and light on the situation.	Kenric Tyghe - Raymond James Ltd.	Thank you. I'll leave it there.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Petrie from CIBC.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the U.S. retail environment and the impact of destocking through Q4 and how that's trending. Thank you.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Okay. Well, look, I think that the market is obviously challenging. We haven't seen a big rebound so far in January and one of the contributors to that could be that the tax refunds are not helping the situation because apparently they're late. But putting that aside and even putting aside the destocking because destocking for us is irrelevant, I mean that's just a point in time.	I think the most important thing for us is really the growth that we have. And our core business basically and our focus in our Gildan brand strategy – our sock unit POS in the quarter was up 9% and the overall market was down 1.4%. And in underwear the market was down roughly 3% in the quarter, and we were up 25% to 9% market share.	So we're really, I think, achieving our goals and driving our strategy basically even in a bad market. And then, as we moved into January as Rhod said our sock POS was up 4.5% in a flat market, but our underwear unit POS was up 41% in January and we have a 10.9% share achieving our target of 9%. And you know we've taken a long-term approach to driving our market share and you know we're constantly working on improving our product features.	You know, we have new product features in our core underwear. We've reformatted our package sizes. We've launched new products this year, our stretch product which is out today, which is doing very well. We've expanded our shelf space. We've expanded our distribution. So, all these things are leading to a long-term growth rate in market share and in our segment.	So we're – we – despite the challenging market, we think that we're positioned well.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Okay. Thanks. And could you just talk a little bit about how your business did online and e-commerce has been performing, and what your plans are to grow that business for 2017 and beyond?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, sure. Look like we said in previous calls, I mean, our focus is on online and e-commerce. Obviously, at this – look, everybody is racing to drive an e-commerce strategy and we've done very well this year. Our e-commerce businesses ended up the year around 5% of our revenue base in branded, up significantly over last year.	So we're – and we're still in the beginning stages. I mean, I would say that, look, there's a huge opportunity for us. We're not where we need to be today, but that's the emphasis of the senior management team and our Board is to make sure that we take advantage of the opportunity. So we're focused on it as we go forward into 2017.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	And sorry just to follow-up on that, I mean, is the capital that you need demand (22:11) in order to accelerate that growth, or as you said be where you need to be or is it just simply execution?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yeah, it's combination. It's not only capital. I mean, it's really more of an execution. It's having the ability to drive our marketing strategy, our sales strategy and our distribution strategy which we're making huge strides for. We're just not where we want to – where we need to be really to make it happen. But we're putting the resources and the structure in place to continue penetrating. We're doing well already, we're just now where we want to be and that's upside to as we go forward into the future.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Very helpful. Thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Dley from Canaccord Genuity.	Derek Dley - Canaccord Genuity Corp.	Yeah. Just one quick housekeeping question here. Does the EPS guidance you guys gave for 2017, does that include completion of the NCIB – the 5% NCIB?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	When you look at the guidance that we gave, the top end of the range assumes that we would do the NCIB, obviously we'll see how the year goes.	Derek Dley - Canaccord Genuity Corp.	Okay. But the bottom end does not then? That's what you are saying.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Does not.	Derek Dley - Canaccord Genuity Corp.	Okay. Good. Thank you. In terms of the large retailer inventory destocking, I mean, this has been something that's kind of been plaguing your Branded division for quite some time now. Is there any visibility on to – is this likely to end any time soon or do you expect this destocking to continue?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	We think that the inventory levels are in line with our customer's expectations. And, again, look at – I mean, at the end of the day, destocking is a point in time really what the driving factors are, are the market share and POS gains, and that's I think how we really need to measure our business. But as far as the destocking is concerned, we think, it's at a level that it needs to be.	Derek Dley - Canaccord Genuity Corp.	Okay. And maybe just one more if I can, in terms of the – you commented on a slight increase here in SG&A spending going forward. Where is the bulk of that going to be directed?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, some of it's going into our distribution capacity as we look to support our businesses. That'd probably be the main driver of our SG&A increase this year.	Derek Dley - Canaccord Genuity Corp.	Okay. Great. Thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shreedhar from National Bank.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just on the CapEx, $125 million seems to be coming down for 2017, down year-over-year, and I think 2017 was lower than you indicated. Is there any room to take that CapEx lower? Just want context on that given your expectations to increase ROIC over time.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, look at – we're in the process of obviously still committing to put in our $1 billion of capacity to support our growth. We're building Rio Nance during this year, and putting all the infrastructure in place to support potential start-up for 2018.	We also have been very pleasantly surprised with our Mexican facility which has brought on additional capacity, which has really changed our look at CapEx as we looked into the future because of the fact that the plant is a large state-of-the-art facility with room to expand which we're in the process of doing. So I think the way you need to look at it is that we're spending our capital right now this year partly to complete the start-up of 6. We're doing a little bit of work in our AKH facility and we're completing some yarn investments as well as some distribution, some selling. So it's spread out everywhere. So I mean if you look at I think in the long range where we think CapEx would be it's probably pretty much in line with the $125 million.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Okay. And in terms of online, seems to be a big focus for many people in the apparel space. Could you give us some benchmarks of where you are right now, maybe mix of sales online, so we can measure to see how you perform over time as you put more focus on it?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, online, right, I said just recently is about 5% in our Branded revenues.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Okay. And is online overwhelmingly an opportunity in branded non-Printwear?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, Printwear is a little bit – the answer is where we're measuring online today is really on retail consumer, direct-to-consumer. That's what we consider online. What's driving Printwear and growth rates in Printwear is the capabilities of companies that are selling product via internet.	Like, to give you an example, before that happened, if you wanted to have a birthday party for your child, then you needed 14 shirts. So you basically probably wouldn't be able to find it. Today, you can go online to various online suppliers and just send a picture of your daughter or your son. And bing, bang, boom, and two days later you got T-shirts in your – at your house.	So online is driving business in Printwear via the printer – the screen printer, et cetera. So it's actually been, I think, a catalyst that keeps supporting the growth rate of Printwear.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Okay. And that 5% includes both pure plays and the retailers that you're operating. Is that right?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yeah.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Or are the retailers...	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	That is correct.	Vishal Shreedhar - National Bank Financial, Inc.	Okay. Thanks a lot.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Okay.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen MacLeod from BMO Capital Markets.	Stephen MacLeod - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)	Thank you. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color around the breakdown of sales for your acquisitions in 2017.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yeah. If you look at the overall impact of acquisitions and incremental impact of acquisitions in 2017, it's a $160 million to $185 million. The way to think about that is about $60 million related to Alstyle, about $50 million related to Peds, and about $50 million to $75 million related to American Apparel. We'll see where we land. But that's sort of the general breakdown between the three acquisitions.	Stephen MacLeod - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)	Okay. So on a run rate basis, would American Apparel sort of still be in that $100 million range?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yes. I mean, the $50 million to $75 million obviously takes in not a full year of sales.	Stephen MacLeod - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)	Okay. That's great. And then just circling back on the retail business, I mean very strong market share gain despite a weak retail environment and lower destocking. Can you just provide a little bit more color like where are you seeing that growth, is it with specific customers or is it pretty broad-based, specific product, just a little bit more color on that would be helpful?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, our unit growth in socks is driven amongst all of our customers, as well as our underwear share. So we're seeing it across the board and that's really – that's been driving obviously our sales growth. I mean, one of the, I would say, negatives in the quarter is that our core business was down and was obviously offset by driving of our underwear and our sock market share, but our core business in department stores was negative in the quarter. So what's really driving our growth going forward will be our core business of our Gildan brand, our Peds and our underwear market share.	Stephen MacLeod - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)	Okay. And are those market share gains coming from more with new retail program wins or is it higher POS sales?	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	It's a combination of higher POS and our existing products, expanded shelf space and as well as new programs and new products. So, it's combination of sorbent (30:19) of different things, so it's – and as we move into 2017 we're going to continue to increase the shelf space. We have new product launches in 2017 and we're constantly – I mean, that should – what should grow our market share as we go forward and that's in underwear. And in socks we're actually going through a pretty good change in terms of our product features and building up our quality features in our socks which will be set to some time in the, let's say, fall, our June, June-July period.	So we're always looking to continue driving our share by having better quality, better prices obviously, and which was driven and (31:11) made the success for Gildan from day one.	Stephen MacLeod - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)	Okay. That's great. Then just one final one if I could. On the American Apparel business, do you – have you made a decision or have you come to like a final – your decision on whether you would be manufacturing in the U.S. for American Apparel or integrated into your existing...	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	We're definitely going to manufacture product in USA in support Made in USA product. But at the same time, we think that there's an opportunity to offer product that's more price centric basically, and allow us to drive the potential of the brand. And as well as using that also to help us to support our international growth as we go forward.	So we're going to do a combination of both. We think that there's – we're going to continue to support their core main USA business, but we also are going to offer product where they couldn't compete before at price points relative to the competitive landscape.	Operator	Thank you. Next we have Sabahat Khan from RBC Capital Markets.	Sabahat Khan - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.	Thanks. I just wanted to maybe get some color on the Printwear outlook for 2017. It looks like taking into account the acquisitions, you're probably looking for low single-digit top line growth there. Can you talk about how the – your traditional Printwear business in the U.S. is expected to do? And then, how much growth you're expecting from the fashion apparel and how the mix looks, kind of, going forward in terms of how much each of those two are going to make up your sale?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Okay. Well, first of all, the market conditions in Printwear are just okay. I mean, they're not gangbusters. So, just as a segue into really our outlook for 2017. What's driving really our business in Printwear in the U.S. market really is the – is our fashion base. Our organic sales are driven by our fashion basics, and will be continue to be driven by our fashion basics and our performance.	We have new product features in both of those categories being launched in 2017. We will also benefit from continued growth in our international markets which we saw in 2016 and we think it will continue in 2017. And then we'll also get the benefit of the Alstyle and American Apparel acquisition.	So, we add all this together, we're going to have high single digit growth. And we think we're well positioned, both domestically and internationally, to continue supporting all of our brands and we're pretty excited about 2017. And one last thing I would add to that is that, we've only put through a small modest price increase in beginning of December, and if cotton stays at the levels it is now, there could be potential room for further price increases to support 2018.	Sabahat Khan - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.	All right. Thanks. And then just on the Alstyle, I know when you guys acquired it, there was a lot of capacity in that facility. How much has it ramped up and kind of how is the progress coming on improving margins at Alstyle, I think, there was some opportunity to bring it up to a level that Gildan was doing?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	We will be close – I mean, bring up margins in Alstyle as we went through this year close to the Gildan model. The plant is running very effectively. And maybe just to point out in terms of the overall capacity of Gildan, we have ample capacity to support if sales are better than we anticipated we have the capacity to support it. But we're also mindful of our working capital, and that's a big focus for the company.	We're projecting to generate significant free cash flow again this year. And – so we'll manage our capacity based on – supporting our working capital requirements.	Sabahat Khan - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.	If I could get one more quick one in, terms of – giving your strong free cash flow for next year, what's the acquisition outlook? Is there a segment you're more focused on, any comments there?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, look we're constantly looking for acquisitions. I mean our first use of case is acquisition. I mean that's just – that's what we've stated for many years now and I think we've got a pretty good track record on acquiring companies, and have built up the skill set of integrating these companies seamlessly into our organization.	And our appetite for acquisitions is varied. In both Alstyle and Peds have been 100% fully integrated into Gildan systems. The frontend, order to cash, distribution and they were complete by December 31st of this year. And the American Apparel will be fully integrated as we come -- as we go into next month. And all of our integration really has been seamless to us from a cost perspective in terms of integrating these companies into our organization.	So we have the bandwidth to continue to support further acquisitions. You know, we are not committing to we have something on our table, but we're constantly looking today to – for ways to continue to support our organic growth trajectory in all aspects of our business and that's both in Printwear and in Branded.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Duffy from Stifel.	Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Thank you. Good morning. Couple questions...	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Good morning.	Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	To start, Rhod, can you provide some color on the state of your inventory positions exiting the year and the expectations for inventory contributions to that $400 million plus free cash flow objective.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yeah, I mean, if you look at where inventory levels are or were at the end of the year, they were basically where we thought they were – would be – I mean, they were up just a little bit obviously because of the retailer destocking, but I think largely in line with where we thought they were going to be. The obviously the less inventory positions reflected the impact of the acquisitions. And then as we go forward, as we look in 2017, I mean, we very definitely don't – do not see the inventory levels rising above where they are, overall. And obviously, we'll be focusing on working capital as Glenn suggested in order to drive cash flow.	So look, I think if you look at our free cash flow for 2017 and that will be driven by our operating cash flow, it will be driven by disciplined working capital and obviously we're running with lower CapEx.	Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Okay. Thank you. And then, Glenn, can you comment on screenprint distributor inventory positions. Are there any indication they're building stocks ahead of anticipated pricing adjustment?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	No, I think, we ended up the year in line with last year, so our inventories are in a pretty good balance right now.	Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Very good, I'll leave it at that. Thank you.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yeah.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Burns from D.A. Davidson.	Andrew S. Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co.	Good morning. I have two brand question for you. First, could you touch on Gold Toe performance and the potential for the brand going forward, especially in light of its exposure in the department store channel? And then with American Apparel coming into the mix do you see any reason to pivot Anvil strategy? Thanks.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	To Anvil strategy?	Sophie Argiriou - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yes.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	So, your question was what's the status of Gold Toe today? Because you cut out there for a second, and then your question is Anvil versus – okay. So Gold Toe, the retail environment obviously in the national chains and department stores has been weak, but we've still done very well with Gold Toe. We maintain relatively the same share as we had previously, but just in somewhat – space has declined somewhat. So you know we haven't factored that coming back in our forecast, so that could potentially be some upside to us, if the market re-bounce back to normalized levels.	At the same time, look we're pushing the brand in areas of growth like e-commerce and hopefully we could – we can potentially see some pickup in our Gold Toe strategy.	As far as the American Apparel, it's going to be positioned as a premium brand within our portfolio of the fashion basics. So the competitive landscape today for Anvil brand positioning is it's priced below, I would say, the – how we view some of the competitors in the market, and American Apparel will be slightly higher than that.	So we'll have a position where we'll keep pricing strategy separated between these two brands, as one is considered more premium and consumer driven, and the other one has a lot of legs. I mean, our Anvil positioning this year and our Anvil brand grew phenomenally this year. It was our fastest-growing brand in our portfolio. So it's also doing very well. So, we're very excited because we think that we have a good brand positioning in both – they can both coexist in the same environment.	Andrew S. Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co.	Thanks. And in the fashion basics now that you have both brands, do you see any potential or need to do tuck-in additional fashion basics brands or will your growth in the category going forward be primarily organic? Thanks.	Rhodri J. Harries - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, we think we have enough on our plate right now definitely in the U.S. market. We also have Comfort Colors, which is one of our also another fashion brand that we have a little bit different in definition, but it's also in that fashion segments. So we think we have the market covered. We have four different price points, four different positionings in an area which is growing and we're seeing phenomenal growth there. So, I think, we're covered.	The big opportunity for us is to leverage some of these brands in international markets, which we have not done for various reasons capacity like, for example, Comfort Colors, we haven't brought it outside really the U.S. because we're still fighting on capacity.	We have a huge interest in the American Apparel brand. So that's another big opportunity for us because international growth is growing at obviously a much faster rate than our U.S. market.	Andrew S. Burns - D.A. Davidson & Co.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Next we have Keith Howlett from Desjardins Securities.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	Yes. On the Printwear market in the U.S., is the basics segment in decline and growth is in performance and fashion basics?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	It's not really – it's not growing, I would say, as maybe we're looking at it. I mean, it's not necessarily shrinking. It's just not growing. And the growth is all coming from the fashion segment. So, it's slightly down, but it's insignificant. But it's basically I would consider it flat and the growth of the market is really coming from the fashion side. Now there is one thing I can tell you, which is an important part, is that – our basic shirts are selling in the range of $1.50 to $1.80. You know, fashion sells for $3, because the end user price of a screen printed shirt, let's say, is $20 at the end. So which tells me we have opportunity in basics even from a pricing perspective. So we think that, that's a good factor in terms of taking the opportunity and looking at it in a different way I would say. So we're pretty excited in the way we're positioned, and you know, we're flexible to drive the market in whichever way it's going.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	And in terms of manufacturing and inventory levels, as you move to sort of a more diverse range of products in the fashion basics and performance, how does that affect your manufacturing efficiency and your inventory levels?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, our inventory levels are going to remain flattish for the year. So there will be – we're working on our inventory. There's still opportunity to manage inventory, mainly because of the acquisitions that we brought on. I mean, as we've worked through some of the inventories. You know the way we're set up today is we have different facilities producing different type products. So the answer to your question is that we're gearing our manufacturing to support this part of the business, I mean, and actually to bring innovation, new products.	If you look at what we're bringing to the market today we're bringing in polyester tech fleece sweatshirt in Printwear which is going to be really beautiful garment, priced right. We're bringing on a whole slew of other fabrications. So – you know with – as we look at structurally changing our capabilities, you know, one of the things we're putting in is the type of equipment that is conducive to producing these types of fabrics. So we'll have different plants producing obviously different product segments and each one of them will be strictly very efficient in their own structure, but will allow us to maximize our sales opportunity for both our divisions.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	And just finally on the international business, is it sort of lagging in the shift to fashion basics and performance or is it sort of right along with you?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, it's actually believe it or not basics in Europe are a much smaller percentage of the business. In the U.S., the basics segment was 60% and the fashion was 40%. It's the other way around in Europe. basics is 40% and fashion is 60%. So that's really why we're so excited about all these fashion brands we're bringing in, because that's going to accelerate our growth in Europe.	We're already growing and most of our growth today because of our limited product offering in these international markets were still because we're new – we're still picking up all the share from basics, but really where we have a big opportunity is to continue growing through the fashion segment. American Apparel could be the big driver of that, but we have a lot of runway in front of us in international markets.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Zicha from Scotiabank.	Anthony Zicha - Scotia Capital, Inc.	Hi, good morning. A follow-up question, Glenn. Could you please comment on M&A market and considering that the U.S. retail outlook is weak, are you seeing more potential targets appearing on your radar and have the valuation multiples declined?	And could you give us an idea, you mentioned that you're going to be looking at acquisition, how big of an acquisition would you be looking at and what kind of leverage you would be willing to go up to?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, look, I mean, we've been very tactical about our acquisition strategy. I think that's the most important thing. We don't want to do acquisitions for the sake of doing an acquisition. We're looking at our key value we can create by integrating these acquisitions seamlessly without any major cost to the company, making sure that they help us to drive some benefit to the company, either a brand, a product.	So we have to have a strategy behind our acquisitions because look, we have a lot of runway still on our organic growth between our Printwear, our international business, and in branded, we're just at the beginning stages. I mean, we've just hit 10% market share in underwear. Our next target for branded is 20% market share as we continue to look at setting targets for ourselves.	So we have a lot of opportunity organically to keep growing our business. So we want to still maintain a very tactical profile of how we do acquisitions and not just do them to create top line sales. We want to make sure that they are fully integrated, that they are meaningful for the company, that they give us a brand, a channel distribution, a product, something that will keep our core organic business from growing successfully and generating huge amounts of cash flow as we go forward.	Anthony Zicha - Scotia Capital, Inc.	Okay. And in terms of leverage, any picture?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Leverage, look – we've committed to one to two times leverage. I think, it's a fair target. We think that – we rather be on the conservative side, we think that we can grow the top line sales with tuck-in acquisitions as well as organic growth strategy and still maintain a very conservative balance sheet, but still at the same time using some leverage to return cash to shareholders and make sure that we use our balance sheet effectively.	Anthony Zicha - Scotia Capital, Inc.	Okay. And then the last question, with reference to capacity expansion and in light of a weak retail market, when would be the earliest Gildan would launch a new Costa Rican facility and could you – if that's the goal then what kind of capacity and cost would it be if you could please remind us on that? Thank you, Glenn.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Okay. Well, look, I mean, when we announced Costa Rica really Mexico wasn't in the equation, and Mexico is – was – is actually the size of what we were planning to put in Costa Rica, so what we ended up doing is we ended up building in excess of $1 billion of potential capacity with the existing footprint that we have today.	So we have enough capacity support a lot of growth. We still own the property. We haven't invested a lot of capital there at this point and we will bring on that capacity in increments of how successful our business is as we go forward. So, there's nothing in the near to short-term saying that we need Costa Rica at this point.	Anthony Zicha - Scotia Capital, Inc.	Okay. Thank you.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Next we have Chris Li from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.	Christopher Li - Bank of America Merrill Lynch	Hi. Good morning. I just have two questions. I guess, first, when looking at your guidance range of $1.60 to $1.70, the $0.10 of difference, what would you say is sort of the main variance or you have the least visibility on? Is it branded volume growth? Is it your ability to take up pricing? What would you say would sort of make up that $0.10 gap between your new guidance...	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Look – I would say look at, we have very good visibility on our business and our business plan. I mean the only thing that really is questionable is the market conditions. We made certain assumptions on market growth.	But I can like for example, in underwear and socks we're projecting flattish type environment, in Printwear we're slightly positive but flattish. So, unless there is something that is materially different than our assumptions, we feel very comfortable with our guidance.	Christopher Li - Bank of America Merrill Lynch	And the pricing increase you've put in December, did most of your competitors follow through as well?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yes, everybody followed that price increase, and it was relatively small.	Christopher Li - Bank of America Merrill Lynch	Okay. My last question and I know this is a difficult one to answer because there's not a lot of certainty at the moment. But I'd love to get your thoughts on border adjustment tax and how do you think internally?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well look, I mean, first of all, I would say is that the – the tax would affect everybody in the segment because there's really – other than American Apparel, there's no apparel made in the United States really to say, okay, so I think that that's the first thing.	Secondly, we think we're well-positioned because 50% – in excess of 50% of all of our cost are dominated in the U.S. from U.S. products, I mean, cotton, spinning, transportation, et cetera. So we think that we're a little bit insulated from – because we're not a completely like an offshore company.	Thirdly, if you look at our two business units Printwear, we know we have capabilities of raising price. We sell T-shirts today for $1.50 and if they sold for $1.80, would it make a huge difference? I don't think so. The net retail price of those shirts is $20, and today even in the fashion segment, I mean, they're selling for over $3, and that's the fastest growing segment in the market.	So when it comes to basics, I don't think that a $0.30 increase in a shirt was – is going to materially affect our sell-through at all in the Printwear business. In fact, our customers gravitate to higher prices and that's why it's pretty easy for us to increase prices, raw material prices continue to go up.	And in branded, when we went through the last cotton bubble, our competitors raised prices significantly and we never did and our competitors never lowered their prices and we kept our prices pretty neutral. So, you know, we have a significant differential between our price and our competitor's price.	So if you walk into the store and you just take our underwear for example and you raised the price by 20% it would be – still be significantly below the competition, but at the same time we think that if our competitors raise prices, they become irrelevant to the consumer basically. So we're not concerned about that at all.	And probably last thing with the tax changes is that they're considering implementing that (53:39) to be nondeductible, and as I just said earlier is that we have a pretty conservative balance sheet. So we don't see that as a major issue as well.	So, look, we don't think it's the right thing because we think, obviously, overall it's going to create instability and I think it will be very disruptive to the markets, but as a company we're well-positioned and we're not really worried about it at this point.	Christopher Li - Bank of America Merrill Lynch	Okay, great. Thanks for your answers. And best of luck in 2017.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. And next we have a follow-up question from Mark Petrie from CIBC.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Yes, thanks. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up actually on the branded business and understanding that margins were pressured in Q4 because of deleveraging on your SG&A line, I wanted to just ask you about your general outlook for the profitability of the branded business in 2017 and over the next couple of years and is leveraging your cost base really the key driver of margin expansion or is it a matter of narrowing price gaps and then supported by favorable product mix?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Okay. We – the first step is obviously as we go into 2017 is we're going to leverage our operating business and our SG&A. I mean that's really the first thing as we increase our sales and also we fully integrated our Peds business basically which is obviously even though it's adding on sales through acquisition. The fact is that that we've been able to manage our SG&A accordingly. So it's back in line. So we see our SG&A next year in branded relatively flattish over on a year-over-year basis, right? So we're going to leverage that.	As we go forward look we think like I said just earlier is that look we have room on price, I mean, we're significantly priced below our competitors. And at the same time we have a very narrow product offering in each one of our segments. I mean, we've got x feet, our competitor has got x times three feet in the retail store. So as we continue to gain more space and add more product that product comes at a better mix and better margins to us.	So we should be able to mix up our margin and our operating gross margins just through mix and continue to drive topline sales from our core business. So those two things as we go forward into the future will continue to improve the operating margins of Branded.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just to follow-up. So the SG&A investments in 2017, that's on the Printwear side then?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Yes.	Mark Petrie - CIBC World Markets, Inc.	Okay. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. And our final question is a follow-up from Keith Howlett from Desjardins Securities.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	Yes. So just wanted to ask about the American apparel market positioning, did you keep any of the American apparel product designers and also I'm wondering whether their retail image, which was quite edgy, is an important part of the brand in the Printwear channel or not really relevant there?	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Well, the answer is yes. We're going to run a small office in L.A. that will allow us to keep the heritage of the brand alive, at the same time continue to use social media, a platform to drive the image and brand image of the brand. We haven't really completed our retail evaluation in terms of how we're going to bring the product to consumers. But we're going to make sure as we go forward that the brand is relevant with consumers, which we think will continue to help drive our Printwear business and we will definitely come up with a consumer positioning for the brand in the near future.	Keith Edward Howlett - Desjardins Securities, Inc.	Thank you.	Glenn J. Chamandy - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Sophie Argiriou for closing remarks.	Sophie Argiriou - Gildan Activewear, Inc.	Thank you. Again, thank you all for joining us this morning. This concludes our call and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you and have a great day.	Operator	Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions for the session will follow at that time. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded.	I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Andrea DeMarco, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. DeMarco, please proceed.	Andrea DeMarco Sieger - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Wendy Beck, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Wendy will follow to discuss results for the quarter and full year 2016 as well as provide guidance for 2017 before turning the call back to Frank for closing words.

A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in the company's earnings release.	And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. 2016 was yet another year of solid financial performance, with revenue approaching a record $5 billion and adjusted earnings per share at an all-time high of $3.41, an 18% improvement over 2015. These results build on successive years of strong financial performance, resulting in a fivefold increase in earnings per share and a near doubling of revenue since 2013, the year of our initial public offering.	Since that time, we have reached several key milestones and we look forward to more achievements in 2017 and beyond, including our much anticipated entry this summer into the Chinese cruise market with Norwegian Joy, which I will update you on later in the call, historic sailings to Cuba on all three of our award-winning brands and extending our growth profile well into the future with an order for the next generation of new ships for the Norwegian Cruise Line brand.	2017 is off to a solid start. The booking momentum we experienced leading up to our last earnings call has accelerated into wave season, enabling us to build a strong base of business. As of today, and even excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, we are in the best booked position in the company's history. We've seen strong booking volumes for all major destinations and a resurgence in demand from North American consumers for European sailings across all three of our brands. Leading up to year-end, our primary focus has been to build occupancy in order to make up for the slowdown in demand we experienced last year.	Since the beginning of the year, the revenue management bias has shifted to increased pricing. As I said before, the key to optimizing net revenue is executing on what I call CYA. First, focus on the C, which is to fill capacity, and we've made tremendous progress in this area and are now significantly better booked compared to the same time last year. Next, the focus pivots to the Y, or yield and pricing, which started to come into focus in Q4, and given our excellent booked position, is now front and center, which is allowing us to leverage our pricing power. And lastly, the A, which is to minimize customer acquisition costs, and which remains in line with our expectations.	Today, our record booked position, which inherently means less inventory to sell, coupled with an improving operating environment, allows us to focus on maximizing price for the remaining unsold inventory. On our last call in November, I mentioned that business as of that time had begun to improve across all major deployment areas over the previous eight-week period versus the same time last year, particularly from North American consumers and primarily as a result of a calmer geopolitical environment.	Since that time, and post the election, the geopolitical environment has remained calm, and business has continued to improve, as booking volumes have accelerated and pricing has firmed. In the last eight-week period, or since the beginning of the year, business has really taken off and has been the most robust since the financial crisis some 10 years ago. As a result, and again excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, we are now significantly better booked than the same time last year for the full year and for each quarter of 2017, with pricing for the full year up slightly.	First half pricing is up mid-single digits. Consistent with our expectations and again excluding the benefits of Norwegian Joy, second half pricing, while improving rapidly, is currently down low-single digits as a result of a few factors. First, we have yet to fully lap the period in 2016 that was most negatively impacted by slowing demand and pricing erosion in the wake of last year's successive geopolitical events. Second, the internationally sourced business that had been on the books last year at this time wore a (7:33) stronger foreign exchange rates prior to the Brexit vote. And lastly, in 2016, we reaped the benefits of an extended premium price charter of Norwegian Getaway in conjunction with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.	While these factors bridge the year-over-year gap in second half pricing at this point in time, going forward, we expect pricing on remaining inventory to benefit from the following factors. First, as we move through the year, new business will benefit from higher pricing as we lap the period impacted by the aforementioned pricing and demand erosion. Second, our European and other premium itineraries are heavily weighted to the back half of the year, and as we move through the booking cycle, we have the opportunity to continue to fill these sailings at higher prices. Should business continue to perform as it has over the prior eight weeks, our remaining inventory would sell at significantly higher prices versus same time last year. To give you some context on the extent of the rebound in pricing, over the last eight weeks, pricing on newly booked business is up double digits across all three brands, with Mediterranean itineraries leading the way.	Turning to more recent developments, and as you know, we have been expecting to receive approval to sail to Cuba for quite some time. So I'm tremendously excited about the upcoming sailings in all three of our brands beginning next month with Oceania's Marina. In the last few weeks, we also announced 25 additional sailings, with weekly round trip cruises from Miami to Havana aboard Norwegian Sky as well as six new departures on Oceania Cruises. We are thrilled to be the first cruise line to offer weekly sailings from Port Miami with overnight stays in Cuba's historically and culturally rich capital, Havana, through December of 2017.	While we have realized meaningful pricing premiums on these first 10 sailings to Cuba across all three brands, it is too early to determine how much of this premium is sustainable over the long run, given the additional capacity that has been approved not only for our three brands but for other industry participants. And while the opening of Cuba is an exciting development for our industry and for our company in particular, it's important to note that Cuba-related inventory represents less than 2% of our total capacity, and therefore we do not expect a material financial benefit from Cuba-related sailings in 2017.	Before I turn this call over to Wendy to review 2016 results and our outlook for 2017, I'd like to provide an update on our China operations. We continue to be big believers in the potential of China as an important source market. Our Norwegian Joy will arrive in Shanghai for her maiden voyage as scheduled in late June. As of this time, Norwegian Joy's occupancy for 2017 based on signed full and partial ship charter and group contracts with major travel agents is significantly ahead of the rest of the Norwegian brand fleet for the second half of the year at contracted prices that are consistent with our prior expectations. We continue to expect that Joy will deliver pricing at a 20% premium to the Norwegian brand fleet.	We have also stated in the past that by the end of 2016, a decision would be made regarding the design of the fourth Breakaway Plus Class vessels slated for delivery late in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a result of the aforementioned strengths of charter and group contracts and related pricing, as well as the resounding feedback and popularity of Norwegian Joy's many unique and first at sea guest-facing features, we have chosen to design the fourth Breakaway Class vessel as a sister ship to Norwegian Joy.	I'll return at the end of the call to discuss our exciting and recently announced newbuild order, but for now I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy to go over into our results and earnings expectations in more detail.	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2016 and 2015 net yield and net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year results followed by color on booking trends, and then will close with our outlook in guidance for 2017.	I'm pleased to report another record quarter of revenue and earnings. Fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.57. Adjusted net yield decreased 1.7%, or 2.2% on an as reported basis versus the prior year. Stronger than expected close-in demand resulted in adjusted net yield outperforming guidance expectations of down 2.25%.	Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel decreased 0.7% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. Higher than expected expenses related to repairs and maintenance mainly due to a technical issue on Norwegian Star, as well as an increase in other ship operating expenses, resulted in costs coming in higher than guidance expectations.	Looking back at 2016, it was another year of record revenue and earnings, and solid financial performance, despite the impact of geopolitical headwinds. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 18% to $3.41, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.38 to $3.42. Our strong earnings were driven by record revenue of $4.9 billion, representing a 12.2% increase from the prior year.	Other key metrics for full-year 2016 are as follows: adjusted net yield for the year was up 1.8%, or 1.2% on an as reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 1.7%, or 1.5% on an as reported basis. And fuel price per metric ton net of hedges decreased 13.5% to $466 from $539 in the prior year. We are proud to share that since 2006, we've reduced fuel consumption per capacity day by approximately 30%, as we continue to focus on fuel efficiency and energy saving initiatives, implementing new technologies and optimizing itineraries.	Now let's discuss our outlook for 2017. On a full-year basis, our capacity is expected to increase approximately 6.5%, with the midyear addition of Norwegian Joy along with a partial year benefit from the annualization of Oceania Cruises' Sirena and Seven Seas Explorer.	Looking at our deployment around the world, we believe we have an optimal mix of itineraries for 2017. The Caribbean will make up 37% of our deployment mix, with capacity in the region decreasing mid single digits from last year, primarily due to the redeployment of Norwegian Getaway to the higher priced Baltic region during the peak summer season. Europe, which will experience a capacity increase of approximately 10%, will comprise 23% of our deployment mix. We have made several changes to our European deployments, reducing our capacity in the Mediterranean region by approximately 10%, and significantly increasing our deployment in the Baltic and Northern Europe.	As Frank mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong demand for European itineraries, particularly from North America. The Asia, Africa and Pacific region will experience a significant increase in capacity, with deployment mix increasing from 3% to 8%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Joy to the Chinese cruise market, as well as the deployment to Asia and Australia of Norwegian Star in the first part of the year, and Norwegian Jewel in the latter part of 2017. As for other markets, deployment is consistent year-over-year.	Turning to the first quarter, capacity is expected to be up approximately 1.5% due to the addition of Seven Seas Explorer, and Oceania Cruises' Sirena, partially offset by an increase in the number of dry-docks in the quarter versus prior year. As for our deployment mix, the first quarter is very Caribbean-centric, with approximately 59% of our deployments allocated to the region. This reflects a capacity decrease of approximately 8%, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Star to the Asia-Pacific region along with a heavier weighting of dry-docks in the first quarter, which is partially offset by increased capacity in the region for both Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. This market continues to show strength, with price and occupancy both ahead of prior year.	Turning to Europe, only 4% of our deployment mix is allocated to this region in the first quarter. This includes a 54% decrease in capacity, mainly due to the repositioning of Norwegian Epic from Europe in the non-peak winter season to the peak season in the Caribbean. The Asia, Africa, Pacific region accounts for approximately 9% of our deployment mix which is up approximately 400 basis points from prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned redeployment of Norwegian Star to the region. As for other key markets, our deployment is similar to prior year.	Now turning to our guidance, for the full year we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.85. Since our last earnings call, strong booking trends including the benefit of voyages to Cuba have offset headwinds from fuel and the impact from a technical issue on Norwegian Star. Adjusted net yield for the year is expected to increase approximately 1.75%, or 1.25% on an as reported basis. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1%, on both a constant currency and as reported basis.	As for the first quarter, adjusted net yield is anticipated to increase approximately 4.5%, or 4% on an as reported basis. The first quarter has a few positive year-over-year benefits, which will help to make this quarter the highest yield growth quarter in 2017. These benefits include Pride of America, the highest yielding ship in the Norwegian fleet, is in service for the full quarter, versus prior year where she was in a 25-day dry-dock. Norwegian Epic is sailing in the Caribbean peak season, garnering higher pricing in both ticket and onboard versus Q1 of 2016, where she sailed in Europe during the non-peak shoulder season. And the benefit from the addition of Seven Seas Explorer and Oceania Sirena, both of which were not in our fleet in Q1 2016, and garner higher yields than the corporate average.	Now turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.25% on both a constant currency and as reported basis. The first quarter also represents the highest growth quarter for adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel mainly due to the timing of dry-dock with five scheduled dry-docks occurring in the first quarter, compared to two dry-docks in the previous year. As well as the previously stated incremental expense of approximately $15 million related to the launch of our China operations, which will occur in the first half of the year.	Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $450, with expected consumption of approximately 190,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.36.	As we mentioned last quarter, there are a few items to keep in mind for the balance of 2017. As mentioned last quarter, we will be up against tougher pricing comparisons in the third quarter when we lap the premium priced 40-day charter of Norwegian Getaway in the period. The third quarter also lapsed the introduction of Seven Seas Explorer, which entered the fleet in a premium market in peak summer season after experiencing record early bookings at the higher prices typically expected in an inaugural season. 2017 marks Explorer's first full year of operation, resulting in a normalization of pricing that takes into account both peak and non-peak season.	And now to discuss our recent newbuild order, I'll turn over the call to Frank.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Thank you, Wendy. As you know, we recently announced a major order for the next generation of ships for the Norwegian Cruise Line brand, extending our long-term growth profile to at least 2025. This four ship order expresses capacity increases smoothly from 2022 through 2025 with an option for two additional ships to be delivered in 2026 and 2027. Each ship will be 140,000 gross tons, accommodate approximately 3,300 guests, around built upon the highly successful Freestyle offerings found on Norwegian's most recent Breakaway Plus Class Ship. The addition of these vessels will allow us to substitute newer state-of-the-art vessels with a richer state room mix to our premium destinations, which in turn will allow us to redeploy existing vessels to other domestic and international home port, where we currently do not have a presence.	In addition, the size of these vessels provides an optimal balance between deployment flexibility and earnings potential, allowing us to add new ports of call worldwide while maintaining a strong return profile with a payback of roughly five years, in line with our most recent newbuild. In addition, these ships have very attractive financing, with fixed interest rates for the first two vessels averaging 2.7% and the second two vessels at 1.25%. The expansion of our newbuild pipeline will drive meaningful revenue growth and will be accretive to both earnings per share and ROIC, further solidifying the key metrics that drive the financial success of our business.	I know we've covered a lot of material on today's call, and I'd like to take time now to answer your questions. So, Nicole, please open up the call for questions.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you, Mr. Del Rio. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Dobson of Nomura. Your line is now open.	Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.	Hey, how are you this morning?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Hi.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Good. Thank you.	Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.	Hey, so would you mind elaborating a little bit on your net yield growth outlook? Specifically how introducing new Norwegian ships impacts your growth trajectory there? There's been a bit of confusion about the comparability between you and Royal.	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Sure, that's a great question. Thank you. So due to the mix of our portfolio brands, as we bring on Norwegian newbuilds, which are highly accretive to both revenue and earnings, their yields are slightly dilutive to our corporate average, which includes our higher yield brands that make up approximately a third of our gross revenue. In other words, the addition of a new Norwegian vessel which has yields lower than the corporate average inherently dilutes yields.	In addition, in 2017 we are also annualizing both the Explorer and Sirena to include the non-peak season. We also do not have the benefit from the Getaway charter, which garnered a significant yield premium in the third quarter of 2016. So again, I'd just reiterate that Q1 is where you'll see the highest yield and then obviously that implies that the back half of the year then is much more moderate.	Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities International, Inc.	Great, thanks, that's very helpful.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is now open.	Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.	Hi, good morning. Frank, I was wondering if you could reconcile your guidance for the remainder of the year with some of the comments you made towards the end of your prepared remarks regarding the potential pricing benefits you could see later in the year. So just help me kind of cull through that all. Is it fair to say that your guidance is what you're seeing now, that is the color you gave regarding the second half pricing being down, or being kind of in the low single-digit range, down low-single digits, but there is opportunity to be above that based on the potential benefit from the easier Europe comps in the second half and your comment that premium itineraries are moving up in price?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Hi, Felicia. So, yes. Look, several headlines here. First one is that business has been very, very strong, as strong as we've seen it in a long, long time during the last eight-week period, and even sneaking into a little bit into Q4 of last year. So I think what my prepared statement said is, should that trend continue, we ought to see the back half inventory sell at higher prices than what already sold for that back half of sailings.	Remember that we have yet to lap, or yet to fully lap, the negative impact of all the cumulative effects of the geopolitical events that we saw throughout last year. A lot of the business that's on the books today was booked during that stressful time. And so as we come out of that and I think we have come out of it, and business continues to improve and pricing continues to move up, the blended pricing of those sailings when they actually take place should be higher than they are today.	Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.	Right, but you're not – so just to kind of put it out there, but you're not seeing that now, so you're not putting it in your guidance yet.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	We have not extrapolated what we have seen the last eight weeks into the rest of the unsold inventory.	Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.	Okay, great. Thanks. And, Frank, just can you help us understand, knowing that you haven't lapped the kind of easier Europe situation, can you kind of help us understand the performance of your three brands in Europe, what you're seeing now in the second and third quarter? You kind of gave us a consolidated – and I know you don't like to talk about brand-by-brand, but maybe just directionally kind of how they're each performing.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	No, that's an easy one, because all three brands, and therefore at the H (28:35) level, are all performing extremely well in Europe. High tide floats all boats so to speak, and this is the case now. So the Explorer continues to do incredibly well, no question the highest yielding ship in the industry, but the rest of the fleet, whether it's an Oceania or a Norwegian vessel or other Regent vessels, are all doing very well, as I said earlier. Pricing has been very strong the last eight weeks, double digits, with Mediterranean itineraries leading the way. The Med last year took the biggest bow, and this year it's taking the largest increase.	Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.	Okay, great. Helpful. And just last one: Wendy, just on your cost guidance, the 1% was a bit better than the kind of 1% to 2% you've discussed in the past, so just wondering what's driving the better outlook. And I know that you've kind of made it very clear what the drivers for the higher expenses were in the quarter, but I just wanted to make sure that there weren't any costs that you expected in 2017 that you were able to bring it to the end of the year in 2016.	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	We have been working very, very hard on a number of supply chain initiatives that have been actively being worked all through 2016 and 2017, so we're getting the benefit of that, as well as we're also getting the benefit of scale, as we bring in the Norwegian Joy and leverage the rest of our costs.	Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.	Okay, great. Thanks.	Operator	Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is now open.	Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC	Great. So I just wanted to clarify – your commentary about bookings excludes the Joy in the release, but your fuel guidance includes it. And so if we look after Q1, because you have that strong increase in yield in Q1, it looks like sort of Q2 to Q4, you're looking for about 1% yield guidance, just doing the back of the envelope math. And it seems like the Norwegian Joy alone would add more than that if you take, like, a 20% premium, and it's 8%, and in fact in the last three quarters it would be slightly more than 8%. So I guess the math I'm getting to – is your guidance suggesting that that yield will be down for the rest of the fleet in the second half? I know you talked about how trends have been improving the last eight weeks, but it sounds like your guidance is assuming that even though prices'll be higher than what's on the books today, they'll still end up being lower year-over-year. Am I doing the math right on that?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Okay, so good question, Robin. I would again point to the fact that it's dilutive to yields, as you bring in – or not meaning – it's not increasing. Norwegian ships are not increasing the yields, so the Joy is coming in on par with the average of the NCLH average yield. So it's not increasing it. It's still going to be one of the highest yielding ships in the Norwegian fleet, but it's dilutive to the overall NC – or at least not accretive to the overall NCLH yield.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah, and I think the big difference is that our company has a good portion of their inventory, of their capacity, with the PCH fleet that has a completely different pricing profile than the Norwegian fleet. The Norwegian new vessels still garner double-digit yield growth compared to the legacy fleet on a like-to-like basis, and we've said repeatedly that we expect the Joy to bring home prices 20% higher than the Norwegian's average.	Still, based on the corporate yield, it is around a push. It is not expected to increase yields significantly, although it does increase revenue tremendously, and earnings per share tremendously. So what we're trying to get across is, focus on revenue growth, focus on earnings per share growth, because for us, yield growth is a secondary story, not the primary.	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	And then the other things that I mentioned that were rolling over, so all – the Explorer, the Sirena and the Getaway Charter. For that reason, when you look at the yields being highest in Q1, you can imply then by our full-year guidance that yields will be much more tempered in the back part of the year.	Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC	Okay. Great. And then one other question clarifying on – and then just a follow-up. I know some of the other lines that operate in China have talked about how at this time last year, they felt great about China, and then having chartered everything, and then travel sellers came back and they had to do things on the back end that ended up bringing yields down lower than what was factored in.	So just thinking about your commentary about what's on the books today, which sounds very strong, are you factoring into your guidance that where you've chartered it is where it will end up? I mean, obviously there's less supply in China this year than last year, so just wondering if your assumption is that, in your guidance, is that you may end up taking some back, or do you feel like where you've chartered it is where the year would end up?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	I think you hit the primary nail on the head when you said that supply growth is very much tempered this year versus last year. Supply is actually up, but up only 9% in Shanghai, where our vessel will be deployed, versus nearly 100% this time last year. So the factors of supply and demand are well in place in China, like it is everywhere else in the world. But yes, we have in addition to the fact that we believe that the market this year in China is more stable, it's one more year of maturity, et cetera. We do have provisions for exactly what you mentioned and it's all baked into our yield guidance.	Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC	Great. Thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is now open.	Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Question about the first quarter, the first quarter guide for you guys on the yield side. And I guess I – we understand Pride of America and we understand Explorer and Sirena, but still, even taking those into account, it seems like the yield expectations a decent amount higher than I think what most folks were expecting. So does it come down to the Caribbean has booked out better than what you guys would've expected a couple months ago? And I know you guys had some deployment issues there in the fourth quarter of last year, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how strong the Caribbean pricing has been over the last, call it a couple months.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	The Caribbean is good. Caribbean is strong. We have some sailings in Q3 (sic) [Q1] that include Cuba, and we said that we've enjoyed meaningful premium pricing on those sailings, which has helped. We also have the Explorer in the Caribbean, which has performed very, very well. So it's never one thing. It's a combination of factors, but overall, the Caribbean is strong.	Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Okay, got you. And the second question would be around the European cruise market and your sourcing strategies over there. I know when you looked back to last year, you guys were clearly impacted the most as you are a little bit more reliant on the North American side of things. But what have you guys done, Frank, in terms of to start changing your sourcing strategies over there and get more locals onboard? Or is it you're kind of not going down that path and staying more reliant on the North American side of things?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	You know, when business is good, it tends to be good in multiple areas, in multiple channels, and that's what we're seeing. So clearly, the North American consumer is more engaged this year, and we expect it to continue to be engaged as the year moves along, versus what happened last year in the geopolitical arena. And so the pressure for us to source away from North America is lessened. As a result of this lessening pressure, the pricing that we're garnering for international source business has also improved.	So in 2017, we expect our international business, ex-Joy, to be up about 10%. So we are sourcing more in international markets than we did in 2016, but the good news is we're not having to do it out of stress. We're doing it in a position of strength, because the North American market, which is the tempo-setter, so to speak, is doing so well. So pricing overall is also finding its way into our international source market.	Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Okay, great. Thanks, guys, appreciate it.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Savino from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.	Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Hey, good morning, guys. Wondering if you could maybe just address the supply picture real quick, particularly in the luxury segment where there's a bunch of new ships coming online. Just wondering if you are seeing any competitive pressure, or if you do think that you're able to kind of find enough demand to meet those needs.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah. The first competitive pressure always comes from within, so in 2016, both the Oceania brand and the Regent brand took on new capacity. We don't have that this year, although in the case of Regent, it does lap for half a year in the case of the Sirena, and Oceania, it laps for about eight months. So in our own world, capacity has been somewhat tempered, but no, I look – 2017 is much better booked across all destinations. Booking the last eight weeks have been at significantly higher prices than the prior year.	Overall pricing is still below where it was this time last year for the upscale brands, but clearly as the year progresses and we start lapping the erosion that took place last year, and if business continues to perform as it has in the last eight weeks, that gap will shorten. But what the status is today on a year-over-year basis, and compare that to how it ended last year, is a very different story as we go through the booking cycle.	Look, capacity in the upscale area has always been lumpy, because there are so few brands, so few ships, but it is not grotesquely outside the – if I recall, the growth in 2016 was some 14%, moderating to a CAGR of something in the neighborhood of 6% for the 2019 to 2022 period. That's not a whole lot different than what we see in the more contemporary space. So I'm not too worried about it. And some of those ships, quite frankly, that have been talked about in the 2019-2022 period, I'm not sure they ever come to fruition.	Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Thank you. That's really helpful color. Shifting gears real quick just to leverage and the balance sheet, it looks like leverage is still kind of on track to be subbed 4 times by sometime in the back half of the year, so wonder if you could maybe give your latest thoughts on a potential capital return strategy?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Great question. So, yes, as of the end of 2016, on a pro forma basis, we actually were at 3.98 times, but still at 4.34 times on an as-reported basis and de-levering rapidly. So on an as-reported basis, we will be at 4 times by the end of the year, and we stay consistent with our plans that we want to continue to de-lever, and that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in the back half of the year. So we continue to be favorable towards share repurchases, but we'll be opportunistic and look at our options.	Mark Savino - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Great. Thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Thank you. Frank, just a clarification, if you would, on a couple of items. One, the international sourcing, did you say that was up 10% ex-Joy in 2017? And then, also the financing cost on the newbuild orders number 3 and 4, that's a clarification. And then as it relates to adjustments for net yield, Wendy, just kind of more of a definitional question there, if I may.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Hey, Tim. So the financing, the interest rate on newbuilds 3 and 4, the average is 1.25%, and...	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Fixed?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Fixed, yes, sir.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Okay.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	And on international sourcing, the 10% is we expect international sourcing ex-Joy in terms of revenue to be up 10%.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Okay.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Which implies the higher pricing that I discussed.	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	And then, Tim, with regard to adjustments to net yield, that actually ended in Q1 of 2016, so you won't see that any longer.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Okay, that's what I thought it was related to. And then as a follow-up, and by the way, thank you for the additional color on the dynamics of the net yield between the brands there. But as additional follow-up, can you talk a little bit, Wendy, about how you roll on fuel hedges on a go-forward basis? And have you seen any change in the percentage that you look strategy long term here, as you de-lever?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Sure. So our strategy has remained consistent. Inherently we say that we want to be at least 50% hedged as we move into a new year. We're significantly higher than that this year at 78% hedged. It is a mixture between HFO and MGO, and hopefully investors and analysts have found it helpful with additional color that we provided in the last couple of quarters and also in this quarter, breaking that out.	So of the 78% that's hedged, then you also have the correlations. We're floating approximately 30%, somewhere in there, and we do use the fuel curves. Next year, we're at 66% hedged, and the following years we're at 48% and 18% hedged. But in those outer years, in 2019 and 2020, we'll continue to be opportunistic. That's what we've done, so we will continue to see benefits of our fuel hedges as we move into those outer years.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Would you hedge less going forward or a higher mix of the higher sulfur fuel as your capacity shifts to China?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	I think we've got a nice balance right now as to what we've presently hedged between HFO and MGO.	Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC	Okay. Okay, thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein. Your line is now open.	David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC	Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Just wanted to quickly first clarify that I think you plan to spend $30 million in China this year. And as a follow-up to that, if that's true, how much do you expect to spend in China going forward? And how should we expect that spending cadence to ramp as you now plan to expand your fleet in that region?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah, so $30 million is what we said our total SG&A spending including marketing and sales initiatives will be in 2017. My guess is that that'll be the run rate through 2018, and as 2019 approaches, that likely will go up when the additional inventory arrives in China.	David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC	Great. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, in light of recent technology announcements from some of your peers, I was wondering if you could sort of broadly comment on your technology strategy going forward and remind us exactly how your on-board customer-facing technology today compares with some of your peers.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah. Well, listen, we're very impressed with what Carnival announced a few weeks ago. We think it's a step in the right direction, and we're certainly going to be keeping an eye on customer acceptance and to see whether it moves the needle. We have had a program, an app – a mobile app that accomplishes some of the things that this newer technology tries to accomplish, so we're going to be continuing to focus on the app that we have out there. It's proven to be pretty popular with our guests, and enhancing it in ways that allows us to do a lot of what the other technology tries to accomplish perhaps at a lower cost.	Second, as you may know, we recently launched a digital bidding platform that allows guests to upgrade their staterooms, and that is very much incremental to yield. And lastly, we've done a pretty good job, we think, of building technology into the Norwegian Joy with many virtual reality features. That is resonating very, very well in the Chinese marketplace and we think is one of the reasons why Norwegian Joy is booking as well as it has, that we are studying to see if we can leverage the concepts across other vessels in the fleet.	David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC	Very interesting. Thanks.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.	Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC	Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you said that if you were to extrapolate out the last eight weeks, that the remaining inventory in the second half of the year would sell at higher rates. Can you just quantify that to give us some context? How much higher would that be?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	I mentioned in my prepared notes that the last eight weeks' pricing is up double digits. I'd like to leave it at that.	Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC	Okay. So I guess it makes it a little tricky just to determine what's embedded in guidance with that 1.75% without knowing exactly...	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Jared, let me make it clear. We have not interpolated, we have not implied in our 1.75% guidance that what we've seen in the last eight weeks will continue, so it's zero. Zero influence, yeah.	Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC	Okay, and then if you were to just take out the first quarter and just look at 2Q through the end of the year, can you give us an idea of what your booked position would look like now relative to this time last year?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah. It's up for the first half. Load is up high-single digits. Pricing is up mid-single digits. For the second half of the year, load is again up very high-single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, pricing is slightly down, but improving rapidly.	Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC	Got it. Okay, thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.	Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.	Hi, thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the recent trends in sourcing. I guess what percentage of the strong recent bookings are coming from new-to-cruise customers in North America? And have the stronger booking trends run parallel with any changes in behavior on board that could affirm a stronger, more confident leisure consumer? Thanks.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Hi, Stephen (50:11). On the on-board side, we saw some weakness in on-board revenue in October of Q4, and almost miraculously right after the election, when I think the euphoria began, on-board revenues have been strong. They were strong in November and December, and continued through January, so we're hopeful that trend also continues.	In terms of sourcing, we've said in the past that we think we have an outside opportunity to gain market share by doing a better job of mining our own past guests. Certainly at the Norwegian brand, we've seen past guests come back to the Norwegian brand up 13% since 2015, and we expected that trend to somewhat moderate, but still be in the mid- to high-single digits in 2017, and so we focused our marketing because we know who they are, we know where they live. We have all their contact information. And we think that's a very efficient source of additional sourcing for us.	Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.	That's helpful. Thanks so much.	Operator	Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush. Your line is now open.	James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.	Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking may call. I guess a couple follow-ups here. I just want to make sure I understand the difference between improvements that were expected, I guess, versus unexpected. Obviously it seems like versus the commentary you gave us three months ago, the full year booking and pricing outlook has improved, although the guidance basically gets us in that low-double-digit earnings growth. So was it that that improvement was already factored into your previous sort of earnings growth expectation or was that offset by other factors, be it currency or whatever else?	And then as we look forward, and this has been asked, I guess, a couple times; maybe let me ask it a different way, it seems like the assumption that you're making on the remaining bookings in the second half of the year is that it's better than what's already booked, right, that the low-single-digit declines, but not nearly as strong as what we've seen in the last eight weeks. Is that the best way to think about that in terms of your guidance and how the remaining rooms book up?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	So, James, good morning. Fuel has actually moved up about 20% since our last call. I also had made mention of the Star technical issues that we had, so those were additional headwinds that we faced, but we have offset those additional headwinds by this strong operational environment as well as the 41 announced voyages to Cuba. So there's nothing further that we have implanted into our guidance for 2017.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	And in terms of the pricing and the yield and the unsold inventory, look, demand is better across the board. It's better from North America. It's better from the international source market. Europe, which was the underperformer last year, is doing significantly better. Our guidance, to be specific, again, does not take in consideration what we've seen in the last eight weeks. Eight weeks does not make an entire year. We've seen that movie before about this time last year, so we're being cautious about that.	What we said about the European theater bookings, and we said it last quarter, was that we were going to assume that 2017's pricing for Europe would be the same as how it ended in 2016. And that's about how it was through most of Q4. In late Q4, we saw a pickup, and as I said in my opening statements, the Mediterranean has really outperformed all other destinations in the last eight weeks. So should it continue, then we would see an up in pricing, an up in yields, but it's a big should.	James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.	That's really helpful. And then I guess maybe just help us to put the guidance, both the yield and the cost guidance, maybe in a bigger picture perspective. The 1.75% increase for this year, obviously you've got the Norwegian brand weighing on that to a degree, but I would assume that you're going to add more Norwegian ships than Prestige going forward. How should we think about that in the context of the typical year and what we might expect yields to grow? And then on the cost side, do we get to a point now that a lot of the Chinese investments are at least in the numbers that we can see that number flatten out in future years in terms of net cruise costs?	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Yeah, so on the yield side, you're correct. As of today, excluding Joy, which comes in later this year, we have two more Breakaway Plus Class vessels coming in 2018 and 2019 for the Norwegian brand, and we have the four vessels that we just announced for the Norwegian brand starting in 2022, and we only have one small 750-passenger ship coming for the upscale brands in late 2019 or early 2020.	So you can see that the inventory is skewing greatly towards the Norwegian brand, and as the Norwegian brand adds more vessels, even though those vessels generate tremendous cash flow, great profitability, very, very accretive to earnings per share, a ton of revenues to the top line, if you're only focusing on yield growth, then it will be a number that is less than spectacular because this is no longer a yield growth story. This is all about earnings per share growth, revenue growth, and the yield growth is still important. We want to grow yield, and we will grow yield, but it's not what to focus on. It's all about the mix of our brands, mix of our ships within those brands.	And in terms of the China, yeah, like anything else, China is a startup for us, so we expect to have higher costs as we enter the market for the first time in 2017 on a per-berth basis than we expect to incur in 2018 and 2019 as more capacity is added to that marketplace.	James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.	Excellent. Thank you.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Nicole, we have time for one more question, please.	Operator	Perfect, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.	Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC	Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on a high level, bridging from the initial $5 to the more recent $3.80, obviously there's been a number of things that have changed, but could you help understand just kind of the buckets or the big drivers in terms of currency, fuel, obviously Europe profitability tied to events and then maybe the Caribbean? Like, how would you kind of slice up that delta?	Wendy A. Beck - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	First off, I would say the vast majority of this is the reset from the revenue from 2016, which then you're starting with a lower base rolling into 2017. So Q2 of last year on our earnings call, we did specifically talk about 70% of the reset was specifically due to the geopolitical headwinds that we had faced. So, that's the lion share, but then there is also fuel and FX that also has been affected, all well baked within our guidance to say that we would be within double-digit EPS growth in 2017 and moving forward. So revenue the largest, and then fuel and FX.	Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC	Great. Thank you.	Frank J. Del Rio - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.	Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your time and support. And as always, we will be available to answer your questions later in the day. Thanks again.	Operator	This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to our – this session. I hope you have been convinced that we are prepared based on the risk (00:15). So, I welcome you, together with the whole executive committee team which is here today in London. They will join us on the stage for the Q&A session. And together with Patrick, we will get through this presentation which should last around one hour, and then we'll take your questions.	As an introduction, I would like to first state – just to give you some – what we want you to maybe remember at the end of the presentation; first is that it is true that the 2015-2016 years have been, I will say, tough years. We faced adverse market conditions. But we have been able to demonstrate that we – our capacity to adapt ourselves and our resilience, thanks to a strong discipline of all the teams of the company. And we will show you, and Patrick will show you, how we consider that we are somewhat emerging stronger out of these two years. It does not mean that the volatility of your price is ended, not at all. I still consider that the markets are volatile. But from all perspective, after these two years, as I said to you before in the previous presentations, we are landing on the sustainable level of investments of CapEx. And somewhat, we are turnings the corner, and you will see that in terms of breakeven. Turning the corner, that means that our cash flows will cover our investments and more than that at an acceptable price level.	And so, this turning the corner means that on the one side, we need to maintain and we'll maintain the discipline that we have demonstrated in the last two years and on the other side, we have begun to do it but we will continue to take advantage of the market conditions to prepare the future, building on our strengths. In a certain way, we can say that what we'd tell you is that we grew from a form of defensive approach to a more offensive ones.	I remind you that we will not update the five-year business plan because we do that once per year. But we will give you enough indications about, of course, the 2016 results, the 2017 objective, and what we want to do to prepare, I would say, benefiting and taking advantage of the market conditions to prepare the post-2020 pipelines.	Before to do that, I will begin to speak about, as we always do in our presentation, talking about HSE, safety, and also environment, i.e. climate change, and then about the market conditions and before Patrick will come and explain the results for 2016 and the objectives for 2017.	So, first, safety. Safety, as you know, is a value, has been elevated to the level of value in the company. This year, we have broken two records. The first one is that for the first time in the history of the company, our total recordable injury rate is under 1%, which mean one incident per million man-hours in 2016. It's very little. It's one incident in the life of somebody who would stay alive 740 years. So, it's very minimum.	And we are clearly there. I think the research or recruit will be also in safety at the workplace among the best, among the majors, not only in financial terms but also for safety. The second report is that we have experienced 435 days, consecutive fatality-free days, 435 consecutive fatality-free days. Unfortunately, it ended end of 2016. In December, we were – a road accident, road fatality in India, which remember first that zero risk does not exist, that all works can be fragile. It's a permanent discipline and consciousness that we need to have to be aware of our safety. But on the same side, it was – it's a big improvement for all of us. We insist on safety because, again, the value which we need to exercise as leaders on safety is discipline and its awareness of our capacity to be excellent. This is exactly what we need to on the operational side.	Last year, we were presenting you the link between safety and operational performance availability in Refining & Chemicals. This year, we can assure you the same schematic for E&P from the Upstream. It's good because it demonstrates on one side, but even if we assume safety reports were already low, we continue to be better. And it's also good because it demonstrates the Upstream has taken the same recipe on Refining & Chemicals in terms of improving availability, and it's part of the reason why Upstream has been resilient this year compared to its peers.	HSE is an important element, and I want to speak about the climate change. We have moved in 2016 very explicitly by delivering a report called Integrating Climate into our Strategy. It's really a challenge for all the oil and gas companies. We recognize it. But I would like to underline that, in fact, when we speak about climate change, we speak about evolution of energy mix, which means, in fact, anticipating the market trends. And so, when we want to say to you Integrating Climate into our Strategy, it's, in fact, thinking through a strategy in line with what could be the anticipated market trends.	Which is the way you can read this picture. So, it's a matter of being conscious of our responsibility in terms of climate change, but it's also important for oil and gas company if we want to remain a major energy company in the future, to think about it. What does it say? It say that you have a potential goal for petrol gas for the next 20, 25 years and beyond. So, that means that why we say in our strategy, we want to expand our gas value chain. It also say the schematic that oil should peak somewhere, 2035, 2040. So, the conclusion for us is less position, less focus on low-cost oil projects. And it also mean that renewables could grow. And so, conclusion in terms of strategy is let's try to build a profitable foot in this low-carbon business.	So, events on the market, we come back to oil and gas. First, oil; the oil market, first, I will insist, they are still volatile. I don't believe at all that there is a flow at $50 like I can read in newspapers, that they give out to journalists. There is no feeling neither, nowhere. I think there is volatility in and around this commodity business.	Having said that – but it's true that the OPEC, non-OPEC agreement in last November is somewhat a historic agreement. But I remember in September and during the road shows after the action meeting, I said to some of investors that I was convinced that this country were really facing difficulties, and they could into an agreement. They've done it. I think they are serious about it. The level of compliance was standing quite strong, very strong. Because clearly $44 per barrel, a lot of countries, producing countries, are facing difficulties.	Having said that, so, this is an important element. But as you see on the schematic, by end of 2016, the supply was still above the demand. Even if the demand is strong, remained strong, 1.5 million barrel of oil per day probably in 2016, it's quite a nice and strong increase. But at the same time as well, the inventories are very high. We should not forget it. The inventories, we have statistics on recent inventories we don't have as the rest of the world. But they are high globally in terms of crude and in terms of products.	So, it will take time before this market will be fully rebalanced. We could also add, as you know, that the investments are much lower. The last two years have been much lower than they did previously. I don't think they will increase so rapidly this year when we see the various announcements.	And so, we consider that we are still in a – yes, I would say, price is increasing. But there is volatility. And we must continue to focus on what we control, not to try to guess the oil price. But what we control is the breakeven of the company. And this is on what we focus in the last two years and then what we will continue.	A word about the gas markets, the gas markets have been clearly, have even suffered this year, a stronger decrease. I think the average gas price declined by 25% compared to last year while the oil price was more in the range of 16%. So, the gas markets have been even lower this year. We know that we face a situation where we have a lot of supply, in particular LNG supply coming into the market from Australia, from the U.S. One of the things which we would like to underline is that the demand has been strong because the price was quite low.	So, on the LNG, you can see an increase of demand of 7% this year with very big – with high figures of increase of demand: in China, 40%; in India, which is a new country to LNG – this year we saw all demand for LNG; in the Middle East, 90%. So, that proves that in the gas, like in oils when you have lower prices, you accelerate the demand. It's a good lesson. And another end of it is that you can see on the map the number of projects of floating storage regasification units which are studied around the world. Today, you have 70 million tons of floating regas capacities being already installed in the world. And there is more than almost 200 million tons being studied.	Why? Because there have been some improvement in technologies and the cost of a floating storage regasification unit is much lower than before and give potential access to LNG to more countries. This is a good message for gas, by the way, and it's not only on FSRU, but we need to work on cost. Also in the LNG plants, we will target to be able to come back to a $500 per ton of LNG production. It would be good if we want to continue to develop the gas market. So, the gas market is facing, on one side, quite stronger new supply. But it's also – this has an influence on the price. But it also helps the demand to come back. So, result of all of that is that the price today, during this winter period, are quite good, including in Southeast Asia. So, there is also strong volatility there and that's why we need to continue to work on the cost.	That's all for my introduction, but I will save the global elements. And now, I will leave the floor to Patrick, who will explain you and present you the results of 2016 and the objective of 2017 before I will come back.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	Good afternoon. Sorry. All the connections are (12:48). The mood is obviously much more positive today than it was a year ago. We are, in fact, facing a very volatile environment. And keep in mind that, actually, 2016 was pretty challenging. Total quarterly result improved steadily all over the year, quarter after quarter. We posted an $8.3 billion adjusted net income. It was a tough year for the Exploration & Production. And nevertheless, Total was the most profitable E&P among the major, basically, thanks to production growth and efficiency gains.	As I mentioned to you, our Upstream was profitable every quarter despite the harsh environment. Of course, and you see that on the left side of the slide, the backbone of the group resilience was the Downstream. Downstream results are about two-third of the group adjusted net income, despite also a sharp drop in European Refining margin.	We also point out on this graph the pro forma contribution of the Gas, Renewable, and Power segment, new segment that is taking place in the group. If it was there in 2016, it would have produced $400 million of net profit.	For the year, Brent average $44 per barrel, a decrease of 17% in comparison to 2015. NBP, the gas price in Europe was only $4.7 per million btu, a drop of 27%. And the European Refining margin indicator was $34 per ton, down by 30%. So, as you see, do not forget that 2016 was a difficult year in term of environment.	On the right side, if you compare Total performance to our peers, honestly, for the past two years, we outperformed our peers and we repeated in 2016. The Y axis is production. The X axis is adjusted net income. The size of the bubble is the size of the net income. Of course, you see us on the top of the chart. The Downstream is delivering good result. This is part of the explanation. Another part of the explanation is that we continue to increase production, 4.5% this year, which is a great achievement after 9% the year before. And structurally, we are improving Upstream forecast production. So, all in all, a very good year and a very favorable comparison of Total performance in comparison to its peers.	Moving to the costs, you know that Total started to cut costs and to restructure its Downstream ahead of the other. Now, cost reductions played a major role in producing our best-in-class result. Compared to our 2014 base, the sustainable cost for 2016 was $2.8 billion. We expect $3.5 billion for this year 2017 and we have a target of $4 billion for 2018. Upstream represent two-third of both figures. This is also because the Downstream restructuring to place before and started before 2014, which is a baseline for those figures.	On the right, you see the positive effect on our OpEx per barrel, where we are currently at $5.9 per boe. For 2017, we target $5.5 per boe. We have the lowest operating cost among the major. Basically, this was said by Patrick, but we are changing the company culture and concentrating us on controllable cost. And this is working.	For 2017, we are ramping up the new Total Global Services unit that will allow for the centralized purchasing of the fourth operating segment at the end of quarter. And you see that on your screens, the world is much nicer with an oil price about $50 per barrel. But we are still committed to reduce costs, to reduce breakeven in order to increase our available cash flow.	Moving to CapEx and investment, for 2016, our CapEx was $18.3 billion. This include $800 million of resources renewal that we acquired basically to Barnett. For 2017, we gave a guidance of $16 billion to $17 billion. This include $2 billion of asset renewal acquisition. So, organic CapEx should be $14 billion to $15 billion plus the $2 billion of acquisition of new resources. And then we gave another guidance for the period 2018 and after of $15 million to $17 million, also including the $2 billion asset renewable. Sorry. These figures include $3 billion to $4 billion a year for Downstream and the new Gas, Renewable, and Power segment. Basically, we are doing more for less at the moment. Of course, this is due to the deflation that we are able to harvest. But this is also due to our own effort to reduce our own cost.	On the right, you have two example showing how we optimize execution and design. One is Maharajah in Brunei. The other one is Zinia 2; and you know Zinia 2 where we cut cost by half. Basically, my comment is outside of the onshore U.S. market where drilling activity has recently increased. There is far more capacity in the service sector than there are project. So, we believe that there is a window today of an opportunity to look in low-cost project.	Since 2014, service cost has deflated by 30%. This is an average. On certain area like deep-offshore drilling, the deflation is much higher, sometimes 50%. So, we currently believe that in our market, it is a bigger market, and we want to take advantage of it.	Moving to production, you remember in 2015, we announced a 9% production increase, and Total continued to execute and deliver an unmatched production growth with, in 2016, plus 4.5%. And we expect to grow in 2017 above 4% again.	On the right, you see the mix of new venture in dark blue, ramp-ups, and start-ups. You see that for 2017, most of our growth is coming not only from new venture but also from ramp-up or start-up already done in 2015 and 2016. The contribution of the start-up of 2017, the top light blue on the 2017 bar, is limited because most of our project – Tempa Rossa, Ichthys, Yamal – will start end of the year and as we are present, we do not take into account any contribution of those fields in our 2017 production.	We confirm our target of 5% average production growth for the period 2014-2020. And the takeaway message here is that we are derisking the medium-term production as I showed you with the ramp-up of the existed start-ups. And our portfolio is rich with giant long plateaus projects that are nearly complete or close to coming on-stream.	Reserve replacement, secure production growth is well supported by our expanded reserve base. We added 1.2 billion barrel equivalent of proved reserve in 2016 giving us a reserve replacement rate of 136% using a constant Brent price. We have more than 12 years of proved reserves and more than 20 years of proved and probable reserves.	You know the SEC rules for reporting reserve. The current SEC rules require that we use the average oil price for the year based on the first day of each month. This average for 2016 give $42.82 per barrel. This is not the average number you have in mind, the $44 per barrel, but that's as far as SEC rules. Using this $42.82 per barrel, we add and we have to debook Surmont because the NPV of Surmont at $42.8 per barrel is negative. Actually, it's positive above $45 per barrel. So, if we were using the same methodology, with the SEC number using current oil price, we should rebook again Surmont positively.	So, this is a result of the SEC rules. We are more focused on the reserve replacement rate that controls price which is something you are much able to appreciate the value, and we increased our reserve by 130%.	Exploration, you remember that in the past we faced difficulties in our exploration. We are turning north to exploration with a new leadership team which is starting to deliver promising result. You have our main successes in red star on this map and basically, we added 500 million barrel of resources in 2016. And on top of that, and you have a look on the top left of the map, we are doing more for less. In 2016, we spend $1.4 billion, drill 19 wells. For 2017, due to a deflation and our own ability to reduce cost with $1.25 billion budget, we will drill 27 wells. Obviously, for 2017, we are extremely happy with the positive result on North Platte in the U.S. on the left, with Libra in Brazil, with Owowo in Nigeria. And over there, there are also some giant prospect in the Vaca Muerta and offshore Myanmar and onshore PNG.	Exploration, as you know, is vital for the long-term sustainability of the E&P because it brings prospect of organic growth.	Basically, our CapEx figures, $16 billion, $17 billion I gave you, includes around $3 billion of resource renewal. Roughly $1 billion of CapEx for exploration. Among the $1.4 billion in 2016, there were $1 billion, $400 million of OpEx. And $2 billion of acquisition of resources discovered by others.	So, this slide was a big debate between Patrick and myself to know who will show to you. On the top – on the bottom left, the robot on Mars. We are growing a profitable low carbon business and we are continuing and growing our R&D budget for the cycle.	On the left, you have the Gas, Renewable, and Power positive contribution. A few figures for this new segment in the company, $500 million of cash flow from operation. More than 9% for ROACE and a little bit less than $5 billion of capital employed. And Total is one of the largest global gas and LNG player. And this robot you see on Mars is powered with SunPower solar panel and Saft battery. And as some people told me, the market on Mars is small but we have a big share of it.	R&D is very important and we haven't reduced our R&D efforts during this downturn of the cycle. And R&D is also key in our ongoing cost reduction. As you see, we increased the R&D cost. On the right side, this is excluding Hutchinson, Saft, and SunPower. So, this is purely the oil and gas business, and we increased our R&D budget by 5%.	Turning to the Downstream, obviously, the Downstream is extremely resilient. It provide steadily $7 billion of cash flow from operation. We do maintain a $7 billion contribution at $35 per ton Refining margin for 2017. The ROACE of our Downstream operation compare extremely favorably to our peers with a number of 34%. Basically, I can tell you we are establishing tacticals on our Downstream operation, and we feel confident that we can provide a sustainable cash flow contribution of about $7 billion per year.	Asset sale program, I know that some of you were skeptical about our ability to deliver $10 billion asset sale program for the period 2015-2017. For the 1st of January, we closed Atotech for $3.2 billion. We have already complete 80% of our program, still about $2 billion to be closed. We are confident that we will achieve the $5 billion target for 2017, which includes the Atotech sale, which is already in our book. Honestly, when you correctly select your asset or your buyers, we are able to sell our asset at very reasonable price at, for Atotech, 12 times the EBITDA, which is extremely favorable for the seller.	The balance sheet, financial strength and flexibility are buoyed on a strong balance sheet. We have managed to keep our gearing around 30%. End of 2016, the gearing was 27%. Our guidance is that we are moving over the long term towards a gearing of 20%. As Patrick told you, volatility is here to stay. This is our thinking. And reducing the breakeven is the most effective strategy to prepare for volatility. And I would say that a lower gearing is also a key objective for the same reason.	Total was the most profitable of the super major with a return on equity of 9%. We are far from our all-time record in 2008, 2009 but posting an ROE of 9% with the bind of 44%. It is really an achievement and we are the best in class on these metrics.	Following our review of the gas prices over the world, I told you the NBP was down by 27%. We have reviewed the value of some of our gas assets in the Upstream division Laggan-Tormore, Angola LNG, GLNG in Australia, and we impaired $2.8 billion in 2016, basically because of the lower gas price assumptions we were using.	And my last slide, we use the same slide last year to show you that what we promised you, what target we were giving to you last year were basically realized. We give you a $19 billion CapEx target including asset renewal, we realized $18.3 billion. The cost reduction, we went from $2.4 billion target to $2.8 billion realization. Upstream OpEx, down to $5.9 per boe. Production growth evolved to 4% target. Cash flow from operation for the Downstream, close to $7 billion. Asset sale, done. Resource addition, we have been able to add 1.7 billion barrel of oil equivalent, below $1.5 per boe, which is very much in line to our initial target which was only 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, below $3 per boe. So, we, once again, do more and use less of our capital.	Thank you. With that, next for Patrick again.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Thank you. And as a transition, the two last page (35:59) of the slide, which is but – yes, and it's good to be the last to announce the results because we are able to provide the slide, so we can make our own advertising, in case you don't make it for us. Yes, we are outperforming our peers. It's the second year in the row. And the ROE at 9%, the second of our peers is at 5%. The adjusted net income, despite that we are smaller in size somewhat in our prediction, we have the second reserves on top of the first, and far above some companies which are larger than us. And our cash flow from operations was quite resilient despite the environment, minus 17%. Our peers, between minus 41% and minus 27%. So, it's, I think, its demonstrating that – and this is important if I just – for me, as Chairman and CEO of the company, that I think, that there again we have been able to adopt ourselves to put in place the programs of what we were telling you which was to be excellent in what we control. And I think we laid down the foundations during the two years, maybe because the times were difficult to be innovative enough, to be disciplined enough, which came together by the way, you know that we emerged stronger out of this period. And these figures, of course, gave us a strong confidence in the way we can now take advantage of the situation. And this will be the thematic of my presentation now, which is in fact to capitalize on our strengths, to work on a future growth by taking advantage of the current market conditions. I already told you that, for me, the right strategy for commodity business is to be able to invest when the price are low because the costs are lower, and because competitors could suffer more than the big players.	So, the first two years of the downturn cycle – or the cycle, we are not able to do that, clearly, because we had to face high investments, high CapEx. So, we were in no way to take more on both, even if we were able to make some acquisitions. But now, we are able to do it. And while maintaining, and it's very important, don't – please understand my speech in there, will maintain the strong discipline. Patrick show you that we are maintaining the cost saving program. We have even reinforce it, $3.5 billion of savings for 2017, $4 billion and we'll continue to work on it because we strongly believe that what we can do is reduce our breakeven. So, you should not understand my message about taking advantage, sanctioning new projects, adding attractive resource by forgetting these disciplines. Of course, the management will decide a little more complex internally but we will manage to do it because all seems today are convinced by the success. And the previous slide I show you, they are proud of it but it gave us a lot of comfort to tell them we need to continue because there, we have the recipe of the success, of the future success. So, taking advantage of low-cost environment means sanctioning new projects – and we come back on it – and adding attractive resource because of cost silo because again, some competitors do not have the same financial strength and flexibility that we have.	The other point I want to raise during this presentation, to answer to some of the questions that I read in papers, is that by doing this growth that we are giving and delivering, this near-term growth is clearly accretive, cash accretive, and in particular, we are increasing our leverage to oil price and I will come back on it. And with these two ingredients giving more visibility to the post-2020 growth, we're showing you that we have a higher leverage, increasing our leverage on oil price is the base rate which renew while (40:17) and I will continue to create value to our shareholders.	So, first, about sanction of new projects, we have a number of projects which are now ready to be sanctioned in the coming 18 months. And as Patrick said, we are fully convinced that maybe we could see in the U.S. Onshore small activities and some price increasing again. But on the rest of the world, after two years of very low sanctioned activities, all suppliers, all service companies are desperate, are hungry for projects, and are fighting for contracts. We've seen that from the two examples that was shown to you by Patrick, but we have other examples. And so, we may be able to sanction projects at a very low cost of CapEx per barrel. So, you have there a list of 10 FIDs on which we are focusing. In fact, we have 11 because we have only one – also one in the Downstream of cracker in the U.S. And this is a mix of giant projects mainly deep-offshore but also some in conventional offshore and onshore, and some satellite developments.	At $50 per barrel with the cost that we are targeting, all of these projects are offering IRR in the high teens, I would say. You have – they represent 350,000 barrel per day of new productions at very good rate of return, with an average of a less than $8 per barrel. If we are able to produce them at $6 per barrel, that means that the global CapEx plus OpEx, as an average, should be under $15 per barrel. So, it's quite an improvement, but this paves the way for the future enhancement of the profitability of the company.	The other activity is adding attractive resource. And in September, I told you there is a lot of opportunity in the market, but I was not able to give you names of opportunities because, of course, we were negotiating them, right? Because they're secret. I think you have seen that we were quite active in the last weeks of December, finding a number of deals that we were cooking during the previous months. I will come back on some of them, but they represent 2 billion barrels of resources at less than $2 per barrel of acquisition cost. And I can say that we have been quite strict in terms of selecting these opportunities.	So, first, and it's important, is back to focusing on our strengths, on the previous slide, that I mentioned. We selected resources where we have the feeling strong, which we are strong, the feeling that we can add value for investors. And the strength of Total are in deep-offshore, are recognized deep-offshore in LNG and in the Middle East and in Africa. So, we clearly targeted assets where we will be able to deliver the value. Deep-offshore Brazil, I will come back on it. Integrated gas LNG also, Middle East, I will also come back.	Just a word about Africa and the Lake Albert in Uganda; clearly, we are in a situation where one of our partner is facing some few financial difficulties. We have been able to strike a deal, which is a win-win deal, where we will consolidate the operatorship position, where we have aligned – now an alignment between partners. You know that, at the same time, we absorb the political debate about the export route for Tanzania. And so now, we have put in place all what was needed to be able to function the projects in the coming 18 months.	A word about Brazil; Brazil, obviously, when you speak about deep-offshore, we strongly believe deep-offshore can be profitable even at $50 per barrel when you are developing giant fields. So, you don't have to be a genius in terms of strategy to look to the map and where you find giant fields in Brazil. So, we developed an approach, and we have been able to convince Petrobras to enter into a direct negotiation because we use one of our strengths which is to be an integrated company. So, we went to Petrobras and tell them, okay, obviously, we are interested by your Upstream assets. We are also ready to develop a larger alliance and being committed on the Downstream products of Brazil, on the Brazil market. By the way, the Brazilian market is quite a large market for the Downstream. And so, we have moved together, and we have put the package together with Petrobras, that Upstream assets, some gas and power assets, the gas terminal, gas pipelines, and power plants and also, by the way, a corporation on technology because both companies are strong in the quarter and want to share technologies in order to lower the cost of the development on the pre-salt.	These have been – I would say, this value proposal, what we put on the table to Petrobras, was absolutely as you see from their point of view, quite appealing, and they entered into that package deal.	So, we'll have access to two big fields in the pre-salt. Lapa, which started end of 2016, we should become operator of it, which will be – we will be the first IOC being operator in the pre-salt; and, Yala, which will be started in 2018.	It came on the top of, of course, of participation to Libra. In 2016, we have a very successful appraisal of Libra. We know that we have, in the northwest part of the field, more than 50 billion barrels of oil. So now, we are all convinced that the minimum development, capacity development, would be standing at 650,000 barrel per day at the CapEx plus OpEx for under $20 per barrel.	So, this deal is offering us a very good position in one of the most prolific with the basin together with a partner, Petrobras, which we – whom we share a lot of common points. And we are excited about it.	Second area is the Middle East. And I have there for the slide is a simple slide. Maybe to fight sort of a wrong idea which I can read in paper, but in the Middle East, the margins are low and that the profit as a return to the investors is not the same as in other parts of the world. We have been able, in the last two years, to sign three big deals, one in Abu Dhabi, one in Qatar with Al-Shaheen, the last one in Iran. The one in Abu Dhabi, I remember, we were quite criticized by some of our peers and I'm happy quite to see one of them joining here, by the way. But maybe, we were quite right to sign early stage because we were thinking that, yes, we are able to improve this quarter and being the first one there offering us a bit of profitability because we are leaders on more assets and not competitors.	Al-Shaheen was a very – it give us a strong base of production and resource with a very low cost of access and the profitability of the two investments is very good. And Iran, we benefit – we will benefit if sanctions do not move of a first-mover advantage in this country. Together, these great projects represent more than 3 billion barrel of resource, more than 300,000 barrels of oil per day of production, more than $1 billion per year of cash flow, and a 15% ROACE.	So, I hope that these figures – we cannot give you more details per project because of confidentiality agreements about the terms – but these global figures will demonstrate and convince you that yes, in the Middle East, we can structure deals which are profitable and give your cash flows as a – to return on the top of very, very long track of sales and low costs sales, which is another characteristics and so fitting well, the anticipated market trends that I mentioned in the beginning.	The other part is LNG. So, on LNG, we told you that we want to develop in the gas, but you changed the same strategy we have on the oil, which needs to be more integrated Downstream, the chain in particular, because we need to be able to develop the LNG demand around the world. We have strong position Upstream, but we need also to develop the demand in a market where there is a lot of supply coming in the market. And so, we have a portfolio. We have bid an interesting energy portfolio. We continue to develop it. We are amongst the three top players in the LNG business. And so, we have taken some positions in the last month in line with the strategy being the leader of the regas terminal in the Ivory Coast, these regas Brazilian assets in the package here with Petrobras. And we just announced yesterday or two days ago, with Qatar, that we are working with QP on a regas terminal in Pakistan, which the project of the regas terminal will offer to Total more than 2.5 million ton per year of new demand for LNG. It comes from the top of the 2 million ton we signed last year with some Asian company in China, Indonesia, and Japan.	So, we are active. We are integrating the chain and we are creating the demand which we required by your portfolio. We have taken another decision which is to enter into (50:53) in Tellurian company which is developing the Driftwood LNG project. You know that is promoted by the founder of Cheniere in Sabine Pass Maybe, we'll regret that we have taken a strong position in that project which was aimed to be able to develop a profitable project, by the way. We will follow it. For me, it's like an exploration well. But it's also the same thinking that it's good to have a stronger position on this U.S. low cost gas towards LNG, because LNG is part of our strategy.	This get me to the next slide which is maybe less obvious to you because mentioning the U.S. among the strength of the company is maybe not so obvious. But in fact, it is clear that in the U.S., first, in 2016, we have delivered more than $1 billion of operations, mainly Downstream. But it is recognition that there is clearly a gas and oil evolution there. And what we want to do is to continue to develop our U.S. portfolio. But again, in the areas where we can add value, which means, for example, Tellurian LNG, as I mentioned, because we understand LNG, which is about the side cracker petrochemicals in Port Arthur. We are in the part of – in businesses that we are perfectly – where we are among the leaders.	In the Gulf of Mexico, so Patrick mentioned that in the U.S., we have made two nice discovery. One of them this year is North Platte, which is above 500 million barrels of oil, so we should be able to develop it. There is still a side track going down which could even enhance this figure. So, we have North Platte discovery. I would say the Gulf of Mexico, when you look to, is probably a playing field which is good for major companies like Total it's deepwater. And since Macondo we've seen some – a lot of U.S. independent shifting from the Gulf of Mexico to U.S. Onshore for different reasons and know there is still a lot of reserves there, which could be developed probably at an acceptable cost, thanks to this new era in our business. And so we have to look – and so now, you have opportunity like Brazil, I would say, for the future developments. You also know that we have taken an opportunistic approach on the Barnett by preempting a sale there. And, by the way, since we acquired this field, it makes profit, which is a good news. So, U.S., we recognize things are happening, but we want to develop a portfolio there but based on our strengths.	The second part of this plays with what message is to also answer to – and I hope I convince you with what we just mentioned, but we are giving you more visibility of what will be the post-2020 growth for the company with the new projects and with the new resources. I wanted also to answer to another question, which is, but we are considered to be less leveraged overall than some of our peers. It is true that in 2015, we gave you a metrics, but we were – we had $2 billion cash flows increased $10 per barrel of Brent, which means – by that time, by the way, we have a $20 billion cash flow at $55 per barrel, $54, $55 – so, that meant 10%. This figure is changing. It's moving upwards, and the new metrics we gave you today is $2.5 billion cash flow impact in 2017.	I will explain you why and it's really going to increase next year where we anticipate around $2.8 billion cash flow impact in 2018. With these metrics, we are, I would say, in the middle of the pack of the majors in terms of leverage to oil price. So, it's an important message to you is that our company is as leveraged as the others to the oil price, is not less than the leverage as I can read some times.	Why do we have this situation? We have it, firstly, because all the near-term growth that we have delivered already and that we will deliver in the coming two years is a cash-accretive growth. The projects, the margins per barrel, the cash flow from operation per barrel, you have there the figures of $60 per barrel.	Coming out as a startup of 2015-2016 is around 40% to 50% higher than on existing producing assets and the margin per barrel of the 2017-2018 start-ups will be even twice higher than the producing assets. So, we, and if I just zoom on this 2017-2018 start-ups, and by the way, you have there nice table that you'll like, you (56:09) so you have a slide there with all the list of the projects with advanced the level of progress for them, which will be started during the years 2017, 2018. They represent 550,000 barrel per day of net production and they are either oil or oil-linked at 85%. With some of them having very high margin per barrel like the deepwater Moho Nord, Kaombo, Egina, or Tempa Rossa or Ichthys.	So, all of which will – is already increasing because of the startups 2015-2016 and will be even higher in the coming years. I would also add that all the efforts, which have been done by the Upstream E&P division under the leadership of Arnaud, to lower the cost and their $6 per barrel. I remind you, we were at $9.9 per barrel two years ago, are also part of this accretive – of this higher leverage to all, and it's also important to notice because it's an important contribution to that higher leverage.	As Patrick told you, also the Downstream, and I would like to insist and give you maybe even more information about it, to convince you that the $7 billion that Patrick has qualified as sustainable contribution will be sustainable.	It's sustainable, and why? Because it's in fact, I would say preferred. It's Refining for 40%, Chemicals for 30%, Marketing & Marketing for 30%. So, Refining of Total in 2017 is a new Refining compared to what we have in 2012 for several reasons. First, we have eliminated more than 300,000 barrel per day of loss-making capacities. The refinery in Provence is closed, is shut down since December. Like the refinery in Lindsey in UK halve has been – the capacity has been divided by two since December as well. So, the restructuring has been done, and we – the Refining, on the top of it, we have started some good assets like SATORP, which is giving the contribution as expected. And also, the modernization of Antwerp, which will be delivered by mid-2017, will contribute to reinforce even more the Refining cash flow from operations. So, it's an improvement of 50% and all of these, what I described to you, as restructuring on one side, these new assets on the other side, will mean lowest to maintain the $7 billion sustainable development, even if there is a decrease of $10 per ton which represents $500 million or $600 million.	Besides the Refining, we have some petrochemicals and they're less known, less well-known, but this year, in 2016, the three big platforms we have on the eastern hemisphere in Saudi Arabia, in Qatar, and Korea have developed almost $1 billion of net resource. These are the best-in-class platforms, more than 30% of ROACE with some capacity increase to come.	Expansion opportunities, we plan to debottleneck SATORP with Saudi Aramco by more than 10%. We have a 20% increase of capacities in Korea and we have more than 40% increase of capacity in line with the side cracker in Qatar. And when you build on existing platforms, this is a way to even enhance the profitability of each platform. So these assets are in the company and they are the core of the success of the petrochemicals like I would say the U.S. platform in Port Arthur on which we want to build a new cracker as well.	And the third part of the last 30%, it represents about the non-cyclical business, Marketing & Services, which is also growing by, we should remind you we have an objective of 4% per year of increasing sales. When you compare the 2012 cash flow from operations through the 2016, 2015, it's an improvement of 40%. And this has been possible, made possible because also some more structuring in Europe. We have focused our activity in Europe on the main markets, so France, Benelux, and Germany. We have sold the markets where we are too small like UK and Switzerland; we will divest Italy this year. But it's also a contribution of Asia.	Our lubricant business, we have invested in some big blending in Singapore also by the way in Dubai. But China now is among our top five countries in Marketing & Services for the lubricant business. And we have also Africa, of course, for the networks and all the businesses. You can see that we have five countries or five large countries with strong position: Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt.	So this business is a non-cyclical business but it's growing. We continue to invest a little more than $1 billion per year. And then there's the leadership of Momar; we are able to continue to steadily grow on our position. So this is the base of why we strongly believe that the $7 billion contribution of downstream is sustainable.	So with all what we've said, it's, as I said in my introduction, 2017 is a year of turning the corner of a cash breakeven, and I would think the benefits of all our production growth and the cost reduction, which again is not finished. So in 2016, at $44 per barrel of cash flow from operations, it was around $17 billion; and our CapEx, $18.3 billion. So we are not able to cover, but from 2017 we are able to cover and, in fact, we are able to cover our CapEx, $16 billion to $17 billion, at pre-dividend, so we were even breakeven under $40 per barrel.	So this, of course, is very important in terms of strength of the company, balance sheet and financial flexibility. If we have – with a scrip dividend being the cash out of the scrip dividend at $50 per barrel, which means, I would say, take up of a scrip of around 50%, so breakeven is at $50 per barrel. We mentioned to you in September $55 on this figure, if you remember well, so it's an improvement; $55 is down to $50. It's down to $50 for three main reasons: so first one is because we have an assumption of $35 per tonne on the refining instead of $25 per tonne which represent more or less $500 million to $600 million as I told you.	We have a second source, is that we have savings of around $500 million, additional savings. So we continue to lower the breakeven, $3.5 billion instead of $3 billion. And the last source is that we have some improved fiscal terms like the one we will benefit on ATCO (1:04:04) which are offering quite an interesting return in terms of cash to us. So we will be in this situation of $50 per barrel. And on the top of it, as you can mention because of the growth we have an additional $1 billion coming from the growth.	This situation of course makes the Board of Directors of Total quite comfortable. We have a strong balance sheet, so gearing is at 27% and are our expectations. We are turning the corner in terms of cash flow breakeven, and this is the reason why we have taken some decisions in terms of shareholder returns which, of course, are the core of our thinkings. We, on our side, we want to preserve the financial flexibility of the company because we, as I told you. we consider, and Patrick reminded you but volatility is still in the market, and it will be a mistake to believe that the trees grow to sky; it doesn't work like that.	So this is important which means that, yes, we give a priority to lowering of gearing even if the medium-term objective as 20%, and we consider from this point of view but the scrip dividend is offering some flexibility even if it's a 0% scrip dividend. A 0% scrip dividend, the take up will be less than 20%, but for, as you know, to implement such scrip dividend you need to go to a general assembly of shareholders, so it's a yearly event. And we prefer to keep a 0% scrip dividend than eliminating the scrip dividend at this stage because of the volatility of the oil markets (1:05:32).	But at the same time, as we told you, we are ready to eliminate the discounts but with a Brent at $60 per barrel, so a 0% discount. We have made the first step in December by reducing the discount to 5%, and we are committed, and the board of directors is committed, to eliminate the discount at $60 per barrel because, in fact, the breakeven should take a 0% discount on the scrip dividend, a take up of less than 20%; the breakeven is around $60 per barrel. So we are just continuing to monitor the cash flow of the company, so the reason is just there. It could come soon; we'll see.	And at the same time we consider there was no contradiction between maintaining a zero percent scrip-dividend and beginning to think to increasing the shareholder return. We selected the tool of increasing the dividend; it's a small increase, 1.6% on the quarterly – the last quarter dividend, €0.62 per share, but it is the strong willingness of the board of directors to demonstrate. But, yes, we are very confident in the strength of the balance sheet, and we are even more confident in the capacity of the company to increase its cash flows for the future as I demonstrated to you, and to have an increasing leverage to oil.	Of course the commitment is not only for the last quarter of the year; it's for the coming quarters. So you will not see, as you've never seen in Total, a decrease of the dividend hence was the €0.62, but it's why I can't speak about 1.6%. And again we believe that it is a combination of maintaining the financial flexibility with a 0% scrip dividend, but also beginning to return to increase the return to shareholders because we have higher cash flows.	So as a conclusion, I just would like to summarize the three messages we delivered to you today. The first one is that we are fully committed to maintain the strong discipline that we have demonstrated during the last two years. Our program on OpEx saving is in place, will be executed as we have executed it, and we have done better than we anticipated.	We gave you a CapEx guidelines in September of $15 billion to $17 billion. We are in the guidelines. And all the program that I mentioned to you about new sanctions, adding new resources, will be developed within the $15 billion, $17 billion guideline. We have room to do that and we – because, again, as Patrick told you right here, we can do more with less in this market.	And second message, we have a near-term accretive growth and an increasing leverage to oil. We have been able to deliver this growth. The projects are there, we are progressing steadily 2017-2018. We still have 12 major projects to come, and we'll deliver – we'll feed that growth and this leverage to oil.	And the last one, yes, we are entering in a period where we are strong enough to use our financial flexibility but within the discipline I mentioned to you in order to take advantage of this impairment by sanctioning new project, low-cost projects, and adding low-cost resources on which we will be able to deliver more value to our shareholders. Thank you.	And so I will invite the whole executive committee to join me around the table to answer all your question.	(1:09:31-1:10:02)	Question-and-Answer Session	Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.	Hi. It's Theepan from Exane BNP. I had a – just a question on projects. Firstly, if you could just flesh out to the market. You talked about the financial flexibility of Total, and very much confirming that $15 billion to $17 billion on a medium-term. Perhaps you could give us a little bit of color on where or how the project spend on the existing asset base is sort of falling to give you that flexibility in the next couple of years?	And then, secondly, I think you have a very differentiated metric, perhaps, versus your peers in terms of looking for sanctioned projects. I think you mentioned the 10 projects, seven of which Total operated. So I wanted to understand again perhaps or get reassurances in terms of how you can execute in terms of delivering your most-efficient projects since the organization have the capacity to really develop 10 projects successfully over the next three to five years or will we see some of the same mistakes we've seen previously? Thank you.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. The first question is around – the answer is 50%. In fact, when we gave you the guidelines in September of $15 billion to $17 billion of CapEx for the next four years, 2017 to 2020, the existing developments, which are being developed, we are presenting around 50% of this amount. So we have room, that's why I can confirm you today, but we stick in this guidelines. We have room to launch new projects and we can add new resources in this portfolio. So this is the first point.	Can we add – so I will give the floor to Arnaud to answer you that questions. Again, just so before – to give him time to think – I have two remark. First, you remember that in terms of human resources, we did not make any lay-off. We decided deliberately to work with less people but not to make lay-off in the company. Yes, some contracted people are gone but we have kept the core of the company intact, and we've done deliberately because we want them to work on costs, strangely, and we wanted also – we were sure that one day we'll need them. So it's time to have them in the company and we will use them.	So, second question – remark is that all the 10 are now big projects. We have five big and five small, but Arnaud will probably complement that answer.	Arnaud Breuillac - Total SA	Just to complement quickly. It's clear that as you know we are starting our projects year-on-year and delivering them on plan. And so we are demobilizing our operated projects, and so we are actually getting off teams and ready to engage in new projects. I can share with you that in the last couple of years, we have questions internally in Total about what are going to be our next projects. Now they know where the next projects are coming from.	I think there is another aspect to it, it's what happening in the industry because, as you all know, there was clearly an overweighting situation in the industry, which actually had impacted also a lot of the supply chain, and as we've mentioned before, today, it's clear that the supply chain today are contractors, engineering companies, are short of work. So there will be capacity there and this – clearly, all of them are trying to retain the best of their people, so we believe the capacity today to engage in new projects is better than it was three, four years ago.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Yeah. I would say that on the top, some of the big projects which were already being developed have stopped or are now ending, so we'll use the part of the staff which we develop – sorry. Now just to mention about, when you'll see the list amongst the giant ones, we have three operated and two non-operated, so the burden is less. It is not five operated even if you were right to remind. But 7 out of 10 are under our control.	Unknown Speaker	Next question on the front.	Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.	Thanks. Thank you. Oswald Clint of Bernstein. Could I ask a question about the LNG? You talked about adding 2.5 million tonnes of new demand, yourselves creating demand. Could you talk about that number? Is that something we could see repeatable each and every year? Do you see scope to create that type of magnitude for Total (1:14:54). And also do you think you could extend further down the gas value chain in countries? I know you talked about Brazil, but what about China, India, and become the customer yourselves in some of these countries from the LNG side?	The second question, Patrick, you mentioned getting into Brazil. You promised or pitched the idea of technology to lower the costs of the pre-sold oil to Petrobras, and that maybe helped you access that asset. What exactly are you talking about there? What type of reduction in cost is possible? Thank you.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. First, the 2.5 million tonnes for Philippe. Explain where they are, especially in Brazil and Ivory Coast in Pakistan.	Philippe Sauquet - Total SA	Yes. Well first, welcome, and we ended 2016 – managed to contract around 2 million tonnes of additional LNG demand for ourselves. And for 2017 we are working, as Patrick mentioned, on several projects, at least three of them. Ivory Coast should turn up if it materializes by 1 million tonne per year of LNG demand for Total share. Pakistan should be closer to the same and Brazil should add a bit less than 0.5 million tonne for the short medium-term; over the long-term it might much more.	So you see that only this project, and I can tell you that we are working on many others, we have the potential today within Total of generating this 2.5 million tonnes of additional demand each year. So we are – we feel safe, and as you've seen the real strength of the market that was shown almost everywhere including in China and India. It is giving us confidence that these countries will also contribute highly to additional demand for the whole market, but including for Total in the medium-term.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Yeah. In terms of can we repeat it? Yes, we have (1:17:26) and which we were – we believe that in LNG, with the market today which is more I would say a buyer market than a seller market, if we want to create the demand, we need to be more integrated. When you go downstream the chain, regas terminal is not a big investment when you think about it, you can't even have some financing on it. It's more complex whereas if you go downstream the chain, we take shares in power plants or things like that. We have accepted to do that in Brazil, but it's part of a larger package. It's not a strategy per se, but if we need to do it in order to have a leverage on the demand, yes, we can do it.	India, obviously when you think to India, because you know like in Pakistan you can say there is a buyer but you have to find the right people who will pay the gas at the end. So it's also a way to secure somewhere the payments of the gas.	On the other point on Brazil, I think Libra is a good example. In Libra, we are working out together with Brazil – with Petrobras, sorry, and I think we are targeting 30%, 35%?	Arnaud Breuillac - Total SA	Yeah.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	35% lowered cost than we had one year ago. So the teams are working together, and they have many ideas. I mean, maybe you can describe some of them, Arnaud?	Arnaud Breuillac - Total SA	Yeah. One of the key characteristics of Libra is the productivity of the well. The expansion well stood at 50,000 barrel per day each well. So you have a very consultative structure. We sell about $3 billion to $4 billion a barrel, and this is the same treat (1:18:57). So if you compare this to our Block 17 in Angola, we will be able to have the same FPSO, repeat it several times. We are thinking at up to four FPSO on the Block. So this standardization will give us some advantage.	Still we're also trying to capture the market situation that we can see, and particularly on drilling. And we are also working, and this is part of the strategic cooperation with Petrobras, on some innovation with regard to the compactification of units trying to get more condensed and compact design for the FPSO.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	But to tell you, it works well because I visited myself Santos in Brazil, in Rio. Pedro Parente is coming to Paris to post soon. And Arnaud and (1:19:51) are working together in managing a number of topics that we want to work together. So it's part of the alliance we have done, the technology is also there. And, in fact, both companies from a business point of view, when you look to deepwater, Petrobras was one of – probably the ancestor of deepwater, and Total came just after. So we have some common points there to work together.	Another question?	Thomas Adolff - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.	Afternoon. Thomas Adolff from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. Firstly, I want to start with just capital allocation or specifically the priorities around the excess cash, whenever you get to the excess cash. You have a framework in place, but often decisions can be taken in a more dynamic manner. And as far as resource replenishment is concerned, you've taken a conscious decision to go for the inorganic approach or the bolt-ons.	But whenever we get to the excess cash and the priorities around the excess cash, the questions I had is should I think about you're going to do more deals to high grade the portfolio? Should I think about a removal of the scrip dividend if that's still part of the plan? Should I think about share buybacks if you get the gearing down to 20%? Or should I be thinking about setting your euro dividend at a level to keep the dollar payout unchanged? That's the first question. And I have a follow-up.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. Maybe will have the right to ask the question. I think we say, actually, the – in terms of – if we have excess cash flow standing, we don't have much excess cash, to be honest, $55 compared to – and since we don't – we gave you, we don't have much. But gearing is clearly our first objective. We want to deleverage the company. We want, clearly, Patrick told you, and it's the first objective.	We never said that we will remove the scrip dividend. We say that we will end the discounted scrip dividend; we confirmed it today. And again, it's mainly back, the take up will be less than 20%, so it's not far from a full dividend but we want to keep the flexibility in case of a volatility.	And we won't end them. If we have more than that, we can see we will buy back shares. But for the time being, I don't have that cash. So it's beyond it, it's beyond at this point. Patrick, want maybe to continue to complement my answer?	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	No. It's a question for rich people.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Maybe we are richer in the industry, but we are not so rich today.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	No, but we'll be glad you asking this question again in three years' time when we have plenty of cash available on us. But this is not the case today.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	But remember, I believe that the best strategy is to maintain a sustainable level of CapEx and investments. So you will not see me – I told you last time, and I told the board of directors, if you see me asking for more than I would say $19 billion of CapEx, stop me. It's a mistake. So return it to the shareholders. It's better.	Thomas Adolff - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.	The second question I had is, last year in September, you showed a chart that by 2020, based on your demand and supply forecast, that there will be a big deficit. I'm not sure whether that's still your base case. But let's imagine a world that is slightly different, that OPEC can produce more, maybe Libya and Nigeria will divide Iran, Saudi Arabia will pump more, Russia can certainly produce more, the U.S. shale can potentially produce a lot more, and Brazil will also contribute.	Now when I look at your portfolio, you do have decent exposure to the Middle East. On my numbers, the cash margin is a little lower. Brazil is great. You went into Brazil. Russia you're not there apart from LNG, the margins are fairly attractive. And U.S. shale, U.S. shale can surprise significantly on the upside, and you don't really have exposure to that. So I wonder in the wells where that deficit don't exist, so that shale is a much better swing producer at much lower cost, how should I think about Total's hedge against that? How should I think about the big resource base that Total has in its portfolio? And how should I think about how much of it you would work say at a $50 oil price? Thank you.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	This idea of shale oil being the best asset because it is a flexible investment, it's on and off like this, it might be correct but as far as I see, even in the U.S. – well it was extremely successful, most of the small E&P companies are facing trouble. There are some very good guys, I won't give you names but you know them, but this industry is facing trouble. So it is not so easy to make money on this matter.	I would remind you also that we do have very large resources in the Vaca Muerta. I know that this is in Argentina, that Argentina is not in the U.S. It might be more difficult; there is a political risk attached. You don't have the same economy of industry available in Argentina. But it is important, and we are currently developing pilots in Argentina and our capability to produce, and we are reorganizing our self within the industry to cope with such a development, and one can imagine such a development with this report of the World Bank for instance in order to mitigate the political risk.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. Very clear. The U.S. shale is too expensive for me; I will be very straight. I studied – we spent, both of us, a lot of, with Patrick, a lot of files. I don't want to buy assets at $80 per barrel or more. I feel we have more opportunities to add value to investors by doing a deal like the one we've done in Brazil, and we have override this, that spending and buying assets were to justify it. And I've studied all of them even $80 per barrel. So maybe I'm wrong but at the top of it, I repeat, I will be a financial investor; I don't have human resources; so what is best for my company? Is it to be a financial investor or is it to use our industry, our capacities and our people in order to leverage and allow the company and to create value?	So, again, this is the situation today, and we work on it. I'm not fully convinced that at $50 per barrel is the best edge for the company.	Unknown Speaker	We have a question at the same table.	Bertrand Hodée - Kepler Cheuvreux SA	Bertrand Hodée, Kepler Cheuvreux. One question if I may. Coming back on slide 21 where there is a list of the 10 FID over the next 18 months. Where do you see a risk on those FID as political or as I would say in terms of cost? What are the project where you are extremely confident that the costs are already right? What are the project where you think you still have some work to do in terms of cost?	And also, finally, can you elaborate more on the Vaca Muerta opportunity? Is it gas? Is it liquid? And also are the costs right or the fiscal terms right there? Thank you.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. The main risk of course is South Pars in Iran. If I don't answer you that, you would be surprised. To be clear on South Pars, the timetable is quite clear to me. The U.S. President and the U.S. Secretary of State will have to sign some waivers, renew the waivers by April and May if – in order to stay within the scope of the treaty with Iran, either they do it or they don't do it.	Our own timetable is to finalize the contracts and to take the FID by middle of the year. So it's doing well from our point of view. We'll have the answer. So either U.S. continue or we don't continue. If they continue, we can – we will move on because, again, we have all the economic terms and the contract is very good. We want to sanction the project. If the U.S. decide not to stick on the treaty then we'll have to obey to the international laws. That's clear to me.	For the others, Libra, one, I will say that you know that there is an issue about local content. The Brazilian authorities that we have met several times, myself, Arnaud with the minister told you that we will have a positive answer, a good surprise, a nice surprise in the coming two months. So I'm trusting them. But again as soon as we have this local content regulation being lifted, it will move quickly because we have – all the partners are dedicated to that. Lake Albert, it's the north end. Bonga South West is operated by one of our peer, but it's working hard on the modified project. We've announcing very good – very competitive costs. The satellite projects are all in our hand.	And a word about Vaca Muerta, Vaca Muerta, we have developed – we have, in fact, quite right, Patrick told you, a huge domain. There is a limitation with the difference which is linked to the history of economic governance in Argentina. We have to face the reality but we have a gas domain which is very easy to develop for us, and we have a first development tranche that we have released a sanction of more than $500 million because we have already the surface treatment capacities. They are there because it was all conventional domain. Conventional position has declined and so we have available capacity. So it's a matter of drilling and connecting. So this is quite profitable.	We are waiting – the Argentinean government has announced what they call, I don't know, a gas plan with quite good prices, around $7 per million btus, and we told them if you confirm that by writing, but we want the paper. We are – in Argentina, sometimes you need to see the papers. We have been paid for that. We will launch the project.	And then we have another area which is more with liquids which we'll just appraise positively. But this one, we need to build the facilities, and probably this is what Patrick was suggesting together with other operators in order to be smart.	So this is a matter for me of at which pace do will be developed there, Argentina, but the first tranche is ready. We sanctioned it internally, subject to having the papers.	Unknown Speaker	I think Irene has a question over there.	Irene Himona - Société Générale SA (UK)	Thank you. So Irene Himona, Société Générale. The downstream is continuing to pay all of your cash dividend costs. So I had two downstream questions, if I may. Firstly, in Marketing & Services, not new managers but conventional Marketing & Services, you mentioned it's a non-cyclical business, it's very stable, et cetera. But surely if you're growing your volumes 4% a year as you did last year, and you're growing into high-margin businesses like lubes, surely the outlook for that business is improving rather than stable profitability. So I was wondering if you can give us some guidance on the outlook.	My second question is on Hutchinson, especially again proceeds. Clearly non-core, it's a sizable business. I wonder if you can share your thoughts about the potential for Hutchinson to free up some capital for you to use in your core business.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Momar, you'll take the first question about M&S, and going the M&S and the reserve and the cash flow.	Momar Saliou Nguer - Total SA	Yes, you're right. We've delivered on the growth of 4%. We've had good results in Europe, I mean, that's our base. We've had good results, good margins. We've had good results in Africa. There's probably the on lubricants, the marine lubricants have been quite difficult here because of the freight – the situation of the freight market where we've had pressure on prices, stiff competition. But otherwise we are delivering. And the 4% – and we are fairly confident that in the coming years, we will deliver on margins and on volumes.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	On Hutchinson, I will repeat what I mentioned already. It's a sizable asset. There is, in each and some, some capacities which could be advantageous for us in terms of manufacturing if we want to develop other businesses like our battery business. So we see some synergies from manufacturing our oil somewhere. I think that you are right, Irene. It's not core, but I'm not sure but Saft is core as well from this point view. If you go to oil and gas, oil and gas is clear but frankly with the balance sheet we showed you, we don't need to sell Hutchinson. I don't want to sell Hutchinson; there is no reason to sell it. And I prefer to keep these type of assets if we face a downturn, once I we'll be happy to trade.	So it's a big asset. It's not easy to sell. It's much bigger in terms of value than Atotech, and we managed to sell Atotech at a very high price, but the bigger it is, the more complex it is also to monetize these type of assets. And so, frankly, it's not on the agenda at all you've seen. With the $10 billion we have executed them, like Patrick told you, with 80%. We have few assets that we will announce soon that we will – is down. And we don't need, in terms of financial strength of the company and balance sheet, to sell more assets for the years after with the breakeven we have done. So Hutchinson will remain in Total even if it's not core unless we have some other big plans.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. A couple of questions at this side. Iain first.	Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.	Yeah. Hi. It's Iain Reid from Macquarie. Just a couple of questions on some of the projects you mentioned. The write down you took on Surmont was interesting me because Surmont is, well it seems to me is a quite good asset. And Fort Hills, which is the poorer asset, you don't seem to take a write down on. So I'm just curious as to what the kind of cost or, in fact, breakeven oil price situation is on Fort Hill? So I know you are attempting to get out of that, if you can.	Also on the Elk-Antelope, that used to be one of the projects in your calendar about to be FID'ed or certainly in the next 12 months or so, then it seems to dropped off there. I just wonder what you're seeing there now which has kind of pushed that one down the pecking order a little bit.	And the last is on your oil price sensitivity. You've made some changes to the PSCs or you negotiated some changes to PSCs in Angola, et cetera. I just wonder whether that has enhanced the oil price sensitivity of those projects or has dampened it as oil prices move up?	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Okay. So first the reserve write down. There are rules; the rules are the rules. It's a difficult exercise, by the way, because you have to understand what we have to do in the company. We have to imagine a world which will stay forever at $42.8 per barrel, and that means that, for example, we have to decide which level of OpEx we will take at $42.8 per barrel if the world was permanently at that level, so we take assumptions. Of course, there is some – it's not a view of OpEx; we have to project that from 20 years. So on Surmont, we work – and we did not work alone, by the way, we have a partner there as well, as you know, an operator – so we exchange data, and we took some assumptions about growing the OpEx but we considered that it was more reasonable to write down the Surmont 1P reserve being down, to be clear. They will come back next year.	So next year we'll have the 300 million barrels will come back unless we have again at an average of $45, less than $45, so it did not disappear. The proven reserves are developed, they are even produced but the SEC has some rules, and we are observing the rules, and we have decided with the operator. We'd welcome that.	On Fort Hills, we worked also on the operator. There is difference between both projects, is that on one side you need to pay for the gas, if you remember; on the other side the OpEx per barrel is more I would say is less expensive. So we have the NPV zero for Fort Hills would have – if we had been under $40 per barrel more or less, we would have add it to the books. So there was a difference when we took that.	In terms of margins per barrel for the future, we'll see what will be best. So, again, it's a little theoretical exercise, and we work with both operators on both assets. We took some assumptions, but was a reserve value calculation. We have done it honestly, and we are ready to answer two more questions.	Elk-Antelope, by the way, it's a good – I will – why is it not because we saved the list of 18 months FID, so, maybe 24. By the way, you know the situation is a little more complex there because for the time being we have a partner which is supposed to be bought by somebody else; it's not done, so we are a little obliged to wait. Even if we work, a remark that I want to do is – but some people were wondering why we were giving up on Elk-Antelope. One of the reasons why that in our portfolio we are thinking on the start that time also to Brazil already.	And so the decision we have to take internally was do we continue to have a bid on Elk-Antelope or do we prefer to put the money on the Brazilian deal? And the decision was also this one. So it's part of the discipline that we had internally. We stopped, but again we have met with a potential buyer together with the previous CEO and the new CEO, and we all agree that we'll find a way to be smart together and to make the most efficient project but we need to have them around the table. So maybe 24 months, and not 18 months but we'll work on it, its part. We did not mention the whole list, I could've added that of course, I would say the discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, North Platte, is part of the projects that we'll have to develop, maybe not in 18 months but 24 months, 30 months. Overall, in Nigeria as well, we have a discovery. So, we have overemphasize. But we wanted to show you what was the list of the projects on which we work immediately as soon – we have for the next 18 months on the table of Arnaud and his team there, a lot to do. We have also to maintain the discipline to continue to maintain the cost-saving program.	So, last question about oil price sensitivity, improved sensitivity, yes, I would say, yes I know. The move that we've done on the Block 32, it has an improvement on the sensitivity. But it was more to cover the low surprise under $60 per barrel. There was no change in sensitivity above $70 per barrel. The PSC was unchanged globally for the price at which we sanctioned the project. We did not ask for anything. We have negotiated new terms in order to cover the low price where obviously, the project was not profitable enough. So, from this point of view, it helps us to have a better sensitivity between, I would say, $40 and $60 per barrel.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. One at the back on the same side. Christian? (01:41:31)	Unknown Speaker	Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Christian Meyer (01:41:34) from JPMorgan. Two questions please. First, on your financial framework, today, you've increased the dividend and you're investing countercyclically. Yet you talk about oil volatility and therefore want to keep the scrip optionality. And I understand in a world where oil is potentially low, what exactly is the priority or the effective order in terms of dividend, CapEx in the context of that scrip?	The second question is more broadly speaking in terms of sort of the industry and the potential listing of Saudi Aramco. You are clearly best in class because of a variety of metrics. How do you think your portfolio will change in the context of a listing of Saudi Aramco? Where would you put capital? In the context of your credit potential, how would you change the thinking industrially?	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	I think I answered the first one, so Patrick will answer you, but maybe in his own word and his own vision of CFO of the company.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	To make it clear, I think we make it clear today that we wanted to maintain the scrip because we are facing a very volatile environment. So, as at today, facing this world and we do not foresee in the near future another world than the one we are facing today, the scrip will be maintained, maybe with a 0% discount if we face a $60 per barrel oil price, but the priority is to maintain this flexibility.	Dividend is a must. We have maintained and continuously increased the dividend for the past I think 30 years. I think Patrick made it clear that it is not our intention to reduce the dividend. We increased slightly, I recognize, 1.6%. This is not 10%, but this is to give a sign of comfort. We are able to slightly increase our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned to you, the dividend for us is a must. We have to pay a dividend, and it's part of our cash flow allocation. And we have established a level of CapEx, $15 billion to $17 billion including $2 billion of asset renewal, which we believe, thanks to our OpEx cost reduction, lower breakeven, enable us in the current oil price environment to finance from cash flow from operation both CapEx at this level plus a dividend partially or marginally in cash depending on the discount that we will use on the scrip.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	To continue on that, I think we will – I hope, anyway, we probably go very shortly to the 0% scrip dividend. Again, it lends its flexibility to take up really less than 20% but if we're facing again a downturn in the cycle, we could react easily to that.	By the way, we have met some investors. For fiscal reasons, in some countries of the world, there are people, investors who are interested to have the optionality of having the dividend in shares and not much but you have some and you can find investors with interests. So, we can enable the 0% scrip dividend, and again, there is no contradiction with that tool and increasing the dividend. That's important to have in mind.	Of that IPO of Saudi Aramco, change the work for you.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	I have been offered a position but that's not true.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Me not. Me not. Me not I will stay at Total. Now, frankly, we will see what will really happen with this IPO and what is the value of the company. I'm not sure it's changing a lot of things for us. But we'll see. Now, if we speak about 5%, I didn't know that the value of an oil company was a multiplicator of the reserves of the company. I had the feeling that was discounted factor somewhere. So, we'll see what will be the value of the company. Now, I don't see the change, the world changing for us from that perspective.	Unknown Speaker	Thank you.	Unknown Speaker	The following questions will be Brendan and Jon.	Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.	Thank you. So, it's Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Thanks for confirming about the ADCO change in terms. Now just to confirm whether there is any retrospective catch-up or windfall from those change of terms? We've been there for a while now. And then just my second question relates to – you've got a couple of very big LNG projects coming on at the back end of this year. Australia, I apologize for asking where we started strong and we often finish quite poorly most projects, which I think nearly every project in Australia in LNG has been overscheduled in that part of the world. What are sort of the key risks and concerns and worries do you have going into commissioning certainly in this (01:47:18) if you could also touch on the amount?	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	The terms were applicable at the date where they were signed. So, they were signed. We were already in the concession. So, we benefited from the terms immediately. That's all. Nothing else to add on that, but I will not disclose the terms to be clear there are some confidentiality on it.	The second question I think was on Yamal and Ichthys. So, maybe, Arnaud, you can answer on Ichthys first about where are we in terms of completion of Ichthys, the timetable, (01:47:58).	Arnaud Breuillac - Total SA	Yeah. So, Ichthys, the offshore part of the project is almost completed now in terms of all of the subsea system installation, preparing for the arrival of the two offshore structure that will come, the CPF and the FPSO. Both of these units actually are still in Korea, ready to sail away according to the operator in March or April. They've actually used the season of monsoon, of storms to complete commissioning a bit further so they have advanced – so that they reduce the amount of work that will be done offshore.	And in Darwin, last in the LNG plant, work is progressing. There has been, as you know, some difficulties with one subcontractor but it is on the power plant and it's not on the critical parts of the project. So, according to us, we are still in line for a start-up before the end of the year on this project.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. I think Jon had a question.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Yamal, I can tell you that Mr. Nicholson (01:49:04) is himself on board. He promised me that before his birthday, he will deliver LNG by October 2017. So, I'm observing him, but I trust him. Now, it's progressing well. It's a huge project. The Train 1 order package are there. They are there in Yamal. It's a matter now of commissioning all that. It's a huge effort to have 30,000 people working in the Peninsula of Yamal. It's absolutely a incredible project. But I think the good news is that the quality of all the modules delivered by the Chinese yards is quite good, is quite excellent. I know it's a huge coordination effort. We have put a lot of teams in terms of commissioning. We have increased the number of people, experienced people from Total to our operation partners there, so we'll see. But today, as of today, I think we have in our plans in 2017 but then we can surmise the October. So, we'll see.	Yeah?	Jon Rigby - UBS Ltd.	It's Jon Rigby from UBS. I've got a question about the financial framework and then just a portfolio question. So, on the financial framework, just wanted to go back to this dividend decision. It seems extraordinary to me that you start moving the dividend before you rightsize the financial structure of the company in reaction to the change in oil prices. And I was trying to figure out why that would be the case because it's clearly, the cycle, the first part of the cycle showed yourselves and your peers unable to fund both CapEx and dividend commitments. And yet before we got to the end of the cycle, you're already upping your dividend commitments. So, I just wondered whether you could just again walk through that decision to sort of preempt the delivery of the efficiencies by lifting the dividend. And does it actually imply, if I take away from your answers to some of the questions, that the scrip portion is effectively a permanent feature of the dividend now in order that you are well below your expectation of oil prices? That's the first part of the first question.	The second is one of the other features is the fact that you are running a cash shortage over the last three or four years is you put about $10 million of hybrid debt into equity. Is there an intention to deal with that at some point as free cash flow starts to rise?	And then to move away from the financial framework, just on portfolio, you've talked in fairly glowing terms about Brazil. Is there an appetite to deepen further into the Brazilian deepwater pre-salt if the opportunity exists? Thanks.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	To be clear, yes, the plan is when the gearing will be at 20%, we will buy back the hybrid debt. Yeah. It will depend on where the interest rates are. The average is a fixed rate, right? If I remember, it's a fixed rate. Maybe in two, three years, it will be good. If interests are high, you will see. We are conscious of what we have done, but yes, if we have to buy back it, we will buy back it. There's no problem with that.	Is scrip permanent? What I told you is that the tool at 0% scrip is not a big issue for the Board of Directors. So, take-up will be minimum but it gives us some flexibility. So, can we keep it? Yes, we can keep it. But again, somebody asked me the question if we have plenty of cash, what will we do with if we need to. If the market is moving up again and we have the feeling that volatility is more on the outside, we could remove it. But for the time being, with the perspective that we see, one of your peer told me, what happens if U.S. share increased, the world is going back to $50. I prefer to have to keep it in place. We prefer to keep it in place in order to be able to react. And this is why we decided and with no contradiction between a 0% scrip dividend and moving on the dividend.	Looking bigger to Brazil, let's finalize the first deal. It's a strong alliance. There is potentially some of the steps. I want the first step. And if you want to marry with somebody, you have to give the proof of love before to enter into a longer duration. So, I think on both sides, frankly, I would say, the marriage is well on its track, and the two, the husband and the wife, I don't know who is who, are quite happy to be together, so we'll see. I mean, again, for me, it's as I told you, it was quite an involvement of many people around this table at the top level of the company to be able to convince our peers at Petrobras that we could do better with negotiation. And this type of – it's a good basis to be able to develop it and it's up to us, of course, to be able to prove. But the trust they gave us will be well deserved, but yes, I told you, deepwater, I can – where can I exercise my competencies? In deepwater Brazil. So, we move it. We move there.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. Then it will be Martijn and Lydia.	Martijn P. Rats - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc	Hi. Hello. It's Martijn Rats with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to ask you two things. First of all, about Saft, I've heard you say in the past that to start understanding the electricity value chain in these new energy businesses, you sort of have to be in some of these companies. You can't just learn about it just standing by the sidelines. And I was wondering now that you have the company for, well, a good number of months and you've seen the books, whether the investment is living up to expectations and were there are any lessons you learned so far.	The second thing I wanted to ask is about tax, particularly with the ADCO contract getting in, could you perhaps help us guide a bit to what the tax rate could be in 2017 both from a P&L as well as from a cash perspective?	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Take this. Tax rate for Patrick maybe?	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	Okay. This is a very simple question. As you can imagine, using $50 per barrel, our average tax rate for 2017 should be in the range of 40%, something like this, but it's extremely volatile. There are countries – due to the gas price mainly, which is not reflected in the $50 oil price scenario, where we are close to paying or not paying taxes. So, my figure may be completely wrong, but that's my best estimate at the moment.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Philippe on Saft.	Philippe Sauquet - Total SA	Well, Saft has been now with us since less than six months. And so, we are still in the process of discovering what is in this company and what is its potential, its additional potential with Total. What I can tell you is that it's even better to what we have imagined, and we on our side are learning a lot about the potential of different battery technologies. And on the other side, we are starting and trying to study really a potential development that would combine the know-how of certain of our other affiliates with the one of Saft in order to entertain some new development. It's just a start, but so far, we are very satisfied with the ability to develop both at the same time cash and R&D programs.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Philippe is more happy with Saft. That means simple work (01:57:24) to be honest with you at least in terms of results. But there is one difference. One, this company is 120 years old and they have a business model which works. So, for us, the challenge is how can we help them to change our size. In fact, (01:57:39) is still trying to look for its own business model, a sustainable one. Lydia?	Lydia R. Rainforth - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.	Hi. Hey. It's Lydia. Two questions if I could. The first one is on the global business services unit. Can you provide the benefits you see from that and help us understand how they could change that really is for Total in terms of the way it operates?	And the second one was going back to the slide that you showed on the FIDs and all those being mid-teens upwards, which are impressive rate of returns. Can you talk about the process as to how you made sure that they really are as good a return that they have really maximized the value coming out of those rather than just taking advantage of the market?	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	Thank you, Lydia. I see the solidarity between women. So, you will have the chance to hear the voice of Namita because she is doing many things in the company at the ExCom, in particular TGS. So, Namita, I give you the floor to answer to you.	Namita Shah - Total SA	You heard a lot today about how despite all the good news, we continue to talk about discipline and lowering our cost, and TGS is definitely part of that. We've initially talked about cost savings of around $500 million. TGS was put in place on the 1st of January this year. We've given the teams a little bit of time to breathe, to find themselves together. It's 1,400 people who find themselves moved from their original homes and put together into a new organization. It's very clear for them what their objective is. They're working on putting things together to start delivering cost savings by the end of this year for 2017. And just to give you an example of how different it is in terms of working within Total, just the procurement part of it was very distributed amongst the branches and amongst the affiliates, and it's been completely centralized with very few people in procurement left in each of the business organization because we realize that it was a huge level for us to reduce cost to start mutualizing things, to have or to speak with one voice to our contractors, to have the same kinds of technical requirements. And so, that's all very much on track, and we will definitely be delivering for 2017.	Patrick Pouyanné - Total SA	I think internally, it's a very strong change. In fact, I think we are creating a real group together and not having businesses side by side. And the Comex, by the way, the way we discuss together on many issues, we are working like that. We are now thinking to see how we will organize at the country level. We speak about concepts like caricatures which was impossible to discuss three, five years ago. So, there is still some efficiency on both sides.	It's not only, by the way, a matter of cost. It's also a matter of business. For example, with regas terminal in Ivory Coast, I can tell you the success has been possible because of course, of gas (02:01:12) from Philippe. But Momar helped because M&As was well implemented in the Ivory Coast. And even Arnaud and (02:01:21) African president because they were there with the operators for exploration helped to do the business. So, it's a matter of putting everybody together. And when we have one objective like Brazil, when we work on an objective in all Brazil, imagining the package where you put together Upstream, Downstream, gas people, it's a lot of effort, but you need to have everybody aligned. So, this is a mentality, a mindset, but we are changing the company and TGS is at the forefront. And so, we are pushing for that, and I think it will deliver. It's more than just $500 million of objective. It's being able to deliver more value being a whole group and working together.	The second question is can we do better IRR than the ones we showed. We are not bad. I mean, I know that you want always more, but I would ask you if all the projects that we sanctioned in the year 2010, 2013, 2014 was at 15% of $50, I would not be here today, and we will not discuss about scrip dividend, but we will discuss about a lot of things (02:02:32). So, frankly, maybe we don't have – it's not enough height. We work hard. I mean, let me be clear. And the market will get us through because as long as you don't go to the market – we had good surprises in market. Zinia 2, we mentioned that project before. We mentioned another one in Brunei. Each time we went to the market, we are a bit of surprised in terms of cost, but on expectations. So, maybe we are prudent on what we save and Arnaud will add a word on it. Arnaud? So, I will learn we will get the better figures.	Arnaud Breuillac - Total SA	Just one point to mention about the continuous improvement that goes on in the company, we have also restructured our technical support division in E&P where we actually are studying conceptual design for new projects by reorganizing them in what we call product line so that we have a product line for deep offshore, one for offshore conventional, onshore conventional, LNG, and unconventional. And the focus is really for them at the conceptual pre-project stage to come up with the most optimum solution from the point of view of cost benefit doing value engineering. And by having a transformation from the traditional mix where we had the subsurface, surface, and putting them inside what is effectively focusing on the type of project that has to be sanctioned, we believe we will go further in optimizing the profitability of our project in the future.	Unknown Speaker	You have other questions?	Robert Alexander Aldrich West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Thanks very much. It's Rob West from Redburn. I like your slide on page 17 showing the targets and how you've realized them all, so like beating your targets. Particularly, I want to ask about your production target for this year and how much you think you could beat it if everything goes right, specifically, I mean, some contingencies that might be in that number. So, whether it's Libya or whether it's some of the projects coming on later or some of the volumes being impacted by the OPEC deal, so if you can give us more of a range, so 4% plus, what could that be?	And maybe there's a second part of my question, allay maybe an alternative interpretation of that guidance, just to rule out, are there any assets in the portfolio where the production this year is not coming in maybe as you'd hoped or the production share in contracts are bouncing back quite steeply? Thank you.	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	The first question, I mean, we say more than 4%. Frankly, I don't know if we will be able to do 4.5% this year. We'll see. I mean, keep in mind, for more than 4%, we did not think – when we made that figure, the OPEC quota were not in place. The OPEC quota would present potentially for us 20,000 barrel less which is 0.8%, but on the other side, we had good news because Al-Jurf field in Libya opened and represent more or less the OPEC quota. So, from this point of view, we are immune. If Libya maintained its production and HRR went up, it will compensate more as the OPEC quota.	But it's the advantage. We have a large portfolio of fields. Some are going better. Some are going not so good. But as Patrick has told you, I think we are very confident about the production in 2017. You've seen on the chart that the size of the startup is quite small. In fact, it's mainly more beyond there. I was in Congo with Arnaud in December. Together, teams told us it will be started by March, April, and we are very confident. So, it's moving on those tasks as planned and the ramp up is planned as these figures ensure. So, we are this year, 2017, when we saw the prospection. And we have quite a little unknown, in fact, except the price of oil and the price of gas which are being announced, but in terms of execution, we have probably less chance, but what is more important is the delivery of the big projects, which are all coming by year-end but, of course, this will be important for 2018.	The second question, I don't know what you – what was the question? What were production growth targets be I just answered to you. I mean, I'm not sure if we have taken the second question if I remember it rightly.	Robert Alexander Aldrich West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	It was just to say are there any assets in the portfolio that are not performing as you hoped that you could flag or the production sharing contract is bouncing back and taking more of the production away that you want to just rule out?	Patrick de la Chevardière - Total SA	No At this stage, again, you have plus and mi",/article/4044641-total-sa-tot-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?all=true&amp;find=RIO

With that, I'll turn the call over to Larry Gellerstedt.	Larry Gellerstedt	Thanks, Pam, and good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us today. Cousins opened the fourth quarter of 2016 with the completion of the historic merger and spin with Parkway Properties. These transactions marked a pivotal point in the execution of our long term strategy, and we accomplished while the team employed extraordinary effort in carrying out our ongoing business operations. I believe Cousins’ fourth quarter performance provides an excellent snapshot of the team’s tremendous work and dedication during the year.	During the quarter, we delivered FFO of $0.07 per share or $0.15 per share before transaction costs. Leasing in all six of our markets was strong with a total of approximately 761,000 square feet in new and renewal leases at very attractive economics.	For the second straight year the team executed over 2 million square feet of leases and I'm pleased to report we continue to experience positive momentum in 2017. Just this week we executed a key lease at Northpark Town Center in Atlanta with WestRock, one of the world's largest paper and packaging companies. WestRock signed a twelve year lease to take approximately 180,000 square feet of space for their new Atlanta office which brings Northpark to approximately 90% leased. Colin will provide more details on deal activity market by market in his remarks.	Looking back to our fourth quarter performance, we completed a series of compelling transactions to further upgrade and strategically position our operating portfolio. First, we sold four office assets totaling just over 2.5 million square feet for approximately $637 million in gross proceeds. Those assets included Two Liberty Place in Philadelphia, 191 Peachtree in downtown Atlanta, The Forum in Atlanta and Lincoln in Miami.	Next, we purchased Texas Teachers' equity interest in Fund II for $279 million. Fund II was comprised of the Hayden Ferry buildings in Tempe and 3344 Peachtree and Buckhead. As a result of these transactions we simplified our ownership structure and enhanced our critical mass in two of our key sub-markets.	We also exited the non-core markets of Philadelphia and Miami and further realigned our market concentrations. Atlanta now represents approximately 42% of our NOI, down from 47% we projected when we announced the merger spin. And in Phoenix where asking rents in our targeted sub-market of Tempe have grown 5% in the last year and vacancy levels are sub-3%, we now own over 1 million square feet.	Coupled with the anticipated buy-out of American Airlines ownership at 111 West Rio, our Phoenix portfolio is anticipated to represent approximately 10% of our NOI, up from 6% post merger spin. Looking forward to 2017, Cousins is well positioned to execute with a critical mass of urban trophy office assets located in some of the most fundamentally attractive markets in Sun Belt -- markets which boast some of the most dynamic and robust demographic and economic trends in the nation. For example, job growth averaged 2.4% across our six markets in 2016 is compared to 1.4% for the broader US market. According to CoStar, these cities absorbed approximately 6.5 million square feet of class A office space in 2016 and reduced vacancy levels to 10.7%.	To further highlight office fundamental health, take a look at the outperformance in our six sub-markets which posted an average vacancy level of 7.9% for the year. In addition to healthy demand characteristics, new supply in the Sunbelt continues to be relatively modest by historic standards, especially in our six markets where office development totals less than 2% of the existing office inventory.	By leveraging these underlying favorable real estate dynamics, we believe that our office portfolio which currently commands top rents in all six of our markets will continue to outperform in 2017 and will ultimately deliver superior returns for our shareholders.	In addition to our market’s positive economic trends and healthy supply demand characteristics, we’re pleased to be located in cities where local governments and business and residential community support infrastructure growth. As an example, during the election in November, Atlanta voters overwhelmingly supported a halfpenny increase for MARTA and a four-tenths of a penny increase for transportation improvements, all within the city limits. This tax will raise $2.5 billion for MARTA to add more buses, live rail and infill stations. I believe this is a huge win for Atlanta and in particular our portfolio which we've intentionally assembled around MARTA stations.	Moving forward in 2017, we plan to further rebalance our market concentration through additional asset sales. I previously outlined two likely candidates in last quarter's call, ACSC, our remaining downtown Atlanta asset and Emory Point, our office and retail project we own in a 75:25 venture with Gables. Once we close on these potential dispositions our Atlanta portfolio is anticipated to represent approximately 37% of our NOI, down from 42%.	During the year we will also remain focused on executing our $512 million development pipeline. Cousins has approximately 1.4 million square feet of office under construction of which 84% is leased as well as 60,000 square feet of retail and 246 apartments. Over the next twelve months we plan to deliver 8000 Avalon in Atlanta, Carolina Square in Chapel Hill and the first phase of the NCR’s World Headquarters in Atlanta. The remaining project NCR Phase 2 and Dimensional Place are projected to deliver in late 2018. Going forward we will focus our efforts on evaluating and securing strategic landslides in core markets in preparation for the next development cycle. With a pullback in multi-family we are now in a much better place to compete for the best locations. That being said, we will continue to exercise discipline when it comes to commencing any future development projects.	Last and perhaps most important for 2017, we will continue to focus on optimizing our operating capabilities and synergies across our markets to drive occupancy and rent growth as well as Cousins style consistency and excellence in customer service.	The Cousins and Parkway teams are fully integrated in all six of our markets and we are truly beginning to see the power in the platform especially on the leasing front. I look forward to sharing more big leasing wins in the months ahead.	To close my remarks, I'd like to reflect back to January 2012 when I outlined a strategic vision for Cousins that focused on three things: simple platform, trophy assets and opportunistic investments. We decided then to streamline our business model to concentrate on top tier urban office assets in high growth Sunbelt markets. At that time only 48% of our NOI came from urban office assets as compared to approximately 80% today. And only seven out of the 31 office assets we own today were part of Cousins operating portfolio in January 2012. As a result of our recycling efforts, our property NOI has increased 187% over five years ago, while our total square footage only increased by 35% in that time.	Needless to say I'm proud of our team and their execution over the last five years. We will begin the next era for Cousins with a 16.2 million square feet portfolio of class A assets in prime urban locations in the Sunbelt, an active and well leased development pipeline and an industry leading balance sheet. This well-executed plan drove positive results in 2016 and I believe positions the company very well for continued success in 2017.	With that, I'll turn it over to Colin.	Colin Connolly	Thanks, Larry. And good morning everyone. I will begin my comments today by briefly highlighting some of our key operational metrics from the fourth quarter. Next, I will spend the balance of my time providing specific updates as it relates to each of our markets as well as additional details surrounding the transactions we closed in the fourth quarter.	The team delivered a fantastic quarter as we leased approximately 761,000 square feet. Our second generation re-leasing spread for the quarter was up 18.7% on a GAAP basis and 14.7% on a cash basis which represents our eleventh straight quarter with a positive rent roll up.	Importantly, weighted average net rents climbed 12% over our results in the third quarter, reaching $26.32 a square foot. Again to just be clear $26.32 a square foot reflects a triple net rent, not a gross rent. I emphasize this because this metric clearly drives home the quality of our urban portfolio post Parkway transaction and definitely differentiates us from our Sun Belt competitors.	Before moving on to the portfolio, I would like to echo Larry’s earlier comments and thank our team. Their impressive operating performance throughout the year while completing a transformative merger spin is a testament to their unwavering commitment to our shareholders, to our customers and to each other.	Starting with Atlanta. We now own approximately 6.9 million square feet across the best urban some markets including a 21% class A market share in Buckhead which has the highest rental rates across the city. Our portfolio was approximately 91% leased at year end which is 300 basis points better than the overall class A market. Our Atlanta team leased approximately 205,000 square feet during the quarter and as Larry mentioned earlier we had a huge win just last night as we executed an approximately 180,000 square foot lease at Northpark Town Center with WestRock, a Fortune 500 paper and packaging company. This exciting transaction will push our percentage lease at Northpark to approximately 90% on a pro forma basis upon its commencement in October of this year. And that is after adjusting for Equifax no move-out of 68,000 square feet in August of 2017.	In our discussions with WestRock, it was very clear that Northpark’s direct access to MARTA was key to their decision. We believe that this close proximity to mass transit will continue to grow in importance with our customer base and be a key differentiator in Northpark as well as our assets in Buckhead and Midtown.	Our team had an extraordinary quarter in Tempe. Our 1.3 million square foot portfolio was approximately 96% leased at year end which has enabled us to successfully push rental rates. At Hayden Ferry we have eclipsed the $40 square foot rent as the value proposition in Tempe given its proximity to Arizona State and Mass transit continues to resonate with customers.	During the quarter the team leased approximately 355,000 square feet which accounts for 28% of our total portfolio in that market. As I mentioned in our last call we terminated U.S. Airways full building lease and simultaneously executed an 11 year 225,000 square foot lease with ADP to backfill the entire building. In addition, we agreed to take back three floors from Genesis [ph], a pre-IPO company with a valuation of approximately $2 billion and simultaneously leaves two of the floors to Amazon and the third to ZipRecruiter.	Collectively the new leases with ADP, Amazon and ZipRecruiter averaged a very impressive 20% rent roll-up on a cash basis. In Charlotte, the market remains tight with vacancy in Uptown just under 10%. Our 3.1 million square foot portfolio ended the year at approximately 98% leased with no expirations during 2017. During the fourth quarter we did convert 69,000 square feet of Chiquita's unoccupied space at NASCAR Plaza to a ten year direct lease with Cardinal Innovations Healthcare. While the sublease alternative prevented us from rolling up Chiquita's below market rental rate on this space, we are nonetheless pleased to further activate this asset and begin a new relationship with Cardinal. Chiquita continues to pay rent on the remaining square footage which has termed through October of 2025. Our team is hard at work looking for opportunities to create value within this residual Chiquita's space.	Switching gears to our Florida markets, we executed 30,000 square feet of new and renewal leases in Tampa during the quarter and our 1.7 million square foot portfolio is 88% leased. The vast majority of our vacancy in Tampa is at Corporate Center and Westshore where we have approximately 191,000 square feet of available space. We view this as one of the better opportunities across the company to drive NOI as Corporate Center is widely regarded as one of the best assets in the strongest sub-market of Tampa. We are very pleased with the robust pipeline of prospects to backfill the space and we are very confident that we will make good progress over the next quarter.	Similar to Tampa, we have very attractive available space in our Orlando CBD portfolio. During the quarter we leased approximately 34,000 square feet improving the 1 million square foot portfolio to 88% leased, with the largest vacancy at One Orlando Centre which is approximately 82% leased. While the activity in Orlando has been soft as of late, we remain optimistic about the lease-up opportunity as the CBD has just 10% vacancy according to CoStar with virtually no new speculative supply under construction.	Lastly, we did have a quiet fourth quarter in our Austin portfolio as a result of that portfolio being 96% leased. Activity across the city as a whole remains very strong with approximately 375,000 square feet of net absorption in the fourth quarter according to CBRE. The overall market finished the year at 9% vacancy and the CBD fell a 6% vacancy creating a very friendly environment for landlords to push rental rates.	To illustrate this point we expanded a customer to 816 Congress last month at a 35% increase in rental rate over their original lease which was signed less than two years ago. We are monitoring the construction pipeline in the Austin CBD which currently totals approximately 1 million square feet. While the pipeline at 77% pre-leased, we are always mindful of the competitive landscape and we continue to reinvest in our portfolio to ensure our assets will remain attractive to our customers.	Turning to the fourth quarter transaction activity. As Larry mentioned we sold 191 Peachtree in downtown Atlanta for $267.5 million or $218 per square foot and The Forum which is located on the edge of the Buckhead sub market for $70 million or $318 per square foot. Interesting to note in both cases the buyer completed the purchase with foreign capital which is a growing trend in our urban Sunbelt markets.	Also, during the quarter we completed the sale of Lincoln Place in Miami for $80 million or $571 per square foot and bought out our equity partners’ interest in Fund II for $279 million. As a reminder, Fund II consisted of 3344 Peachtree in Buckhead, the Hayden Ferry properties in Tempe as well as cash from the previous sale of Two Liberty Place and a promote owed [ph] to Cousins based on the positive performance of the fund. This was a complicated transaction with lots of moving pieces but the simple framework of the deal was based on a blended gross valuation of $409 per square foot for the real estate assets in Tempe and Buckhead. The year one cap rate on a cash basis is projected to be approximately 6% and it’s projected to stabilize in the mid sixes with the growth driven primarily by contractual leasing.	Before I turn the call over to Gregg, I would like to highlight some of the recent leasing activity at two of our development projects. At Carolina Square, our mixed use project in Chapel Hill, we signed a 15,000 square feet lease during the fourth quarter bringing the office component up to 74% leased. At 8000 Avalon, our 224,000 square foot office project in Atlanta, we signed 9000 square feet of new leases in January of 2017.	In addition, we have recently agreed to terms on an approximately 30,000 square foot deal which would increase the project to 38% leased upon execution. With the addition of this new leasing activity post quarter end, our $512 million development pipeline which includes 1.4 million square feet of office would be approximately 87% leased.	With that, I'll turn the call over to Gregg.	Gregg Adzema	Thanks, Colin. Good morning everyone. Well it was clearly a busy quarter here at Cousins and our financial statements reflect that activity. What I hope shines through is the underlying strength of our properties and of our markets. We did well where we’d like to do well. Same property NOI on a cash basis was up 7.1% during the quarter and 8.4% during the year. Second generation releasing spreads were firmly positive with double digit growth on a cash basis during both the quarter and the year. And leasing velocity was strong finishing 2016 with positive upward momentum.	With that, I’d like to start my comments by pointing out a few of the accounting items that may prove helpful as you review our financial statements and our earning supplement. Then I’d like to discuss the significant items that ran through a result this quarter and finally I'd like to conclude by looking ahead at the capital markets activities we have planned for 2017 and reaffirming our previously provided earnings guidance.	Let’s start with the accounting items. First, please remember that we completed our merger with Parkway on October 6. So our quarterly results do not include a full quarter of Parkway results. Inside the supplement you will specifically see this on page eight where we provide asset by asset NOI numbers and on page 10 where we provide asset by asset interest expense for those assets that have property specific debt.	Included in these partial quarter Parkway results are 100% of the Texas Teachers Fund II assets. We purchased Texas Teachers interest in this fund on December 23. So we only actually owned 100% of these assets for the final week of the quarter. Texas Teachers’ portion of the results for the period of time they had ownership in the fund is removed under a line and titled partner share of FFO and consolidated joint ventures on page ten of the supplement.	In addition we also included in these partial quarter results, our 75% ownership interest in 111 West Rio and Tempe, formerly known as the US Airways building. U.S. Airways terminated their lease in early November, so the numbers in our supplement only reflect approximately one month of ownership.	Finally, [indiscernible] classify the operations of the Houston assets we spun into new Parkway which are Greenway and Post Oak into discontinued operations. So again on those same pages in our supplement you will not see these two assets listed. Their results are consolidated into the discontinued operations line items and only include a period of our ownership during the quarter which was essentially the first week of October.	You'll also notice that our same property pool was small this quarter relative to the size of the entire property portfolio, comprising approximately 18% of our total NOI. Consistent with prior practices, we have only included assets that we owned as of January 1 of the previous year in our same property pool so that we can provide clean year over year comparisons under our ownership.	The unique combination of the Parkway merger and Houston spin-off is the primary reason behind our small same property pool in the fourth quarter using this definition. Of course, we have prior Parkway data on each of the legacy assets. But as usual, GAAP gets in the way of easily using this data. Parkway made GAAP adjustments to their property and so did we when we merged with them. Therefore the GAAP comparison is not meaningful. A comparison of cash results, however, would be helpful and we will look into this potentially providing this data in addition to our traditional same property data in some form in 2017.	The following year and beyond, the same property pool using our historic methodology should again represent the majority of our cash flow and provide meaningful GAAP and cash comparison data going forward.	There's one other item I’d like to point out in our supplement that has nothing to do with Parkway transaction but merits mentioning. The fully amortizing mortgage associated with Gateway Village in Charlotte matured during the fourth quarter specifically on December first. As we have discussed several times in the past, once this mortgage matured, our 50:50 joint venture arrangement with Bank of America on this building shifted from us receiving an 11.46 preferred return to us receiving a 50:50 split of the cash flows. Therefore the fourth quarter NOI for Gateway Village in our supplement reflects two months of preferred return and one month of a 50:50 split.	With that, let's move on to the significant items that ran through our financial statements during the fourth quarter. Obviously the large item was the Parkway transaction costs. We incurred $26.5 million in transaction costs during the fourth quarter. And we've incurred almost $31 million in total transaction costs to date.	We also continued to proactively reduce our non-core landholdings during the fourth quarter through three separate sales which resulted in a cumulative net loss of approximately $800,000. All of the land we sold is located in Atlanta, and it was comprised of a commercial pad in Alpharetta, several hundred acres of residential land in Paulding County and our long held joint venture interest in Callaway. After these sales, our land holdings now represent less than one-half of 1% of our total asset value. As Larry said earlier we are now turning our attention to increasing our land holdings with acquisitions that complement our strategic focus on key urban sub-markets.	The U.S. Airways transaction at Tempe that Colin discussed earlier accomplished many important objectives including generating a $2.8 million termination fee during the quarter. Termination fees, although very lumpy and difficult to accurately predict, are a recurring part of our business. So this fee in and of itself is not unusual. However the size of it is extraordinarily large which is why I wanted to draw your attention to it.	Our general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter were also unusually large. This was caused by a sharp increase in our long term incentive compensation accrual which was driven by our strong recent share price performance. During periods of share price volatility this compensation accrual can be very jumpy which was certainly the case during 2016.	Our quarterly G&A expenses moved from $8.2 million during the first quarter of the year to approximately $4.5 million during each of the second third quarters and back up to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter. It wasn't always this way. However since late 2014 our shares have traded in a range arranging almost twice as wide as the RMZ. First driven by oil prices and our Houston exposure and then driven by the Parkway transaction. Rest assured our actual core G&A expenses are not this volatile.	Finally we completed quite a bit of productive work during the fourth quarter both commensurate with the Parkway closing and soon afterward, to clean up our post merger balance sheet which resulted in $5.2 million in debt extinguishment costs. Included in this number are costs associated with some of the debt we paid off when we purchased Texas Teachers interest in Fund II as well as prepayment costs associated with several other mortgages.	Looking forward we have two primary balance sheet objectives in 2017. First we need to address a little over $550 million in debt that matures during the year. Approximately $200 million of this debt will be retired through the identified asset sales Larry and Colin talked about earlier: Emory Point and the American Cancer Society Center. The remaining $350 million of debt maturities is associated with legacy Parkway assets and will be refinanced. With an average coupon of 5.84% on this maturing debt we have a real opportunity to bring our interest costs down materially with this refinancing.	Second, we need to reduce leverage. We've purposely maintained a very low levered balance sheet over the past few years with net debt to EBITDA right around 4.5 times. So why so low? Let me take a moment to explain our rationale.	Cousins has over 50 years of development expertise. We believe we have created and continue to create significant value through our development activities. But a development pipeline does increase corporate risk. We manage this risk by capping our development efforts as a percentage of our total asset base as well as maintaining a low levered balance sheet. We believe this combination a prudent development effort supported by conservative balance sheet is very compelling. We also like the dry powder low leverage provides during times of macro-economic stress.	As part of the Parkway transactions we transferred some of our low leverage to new Parkway to ensure their financial strength at the time of the spin-off. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio has increased to 5.2 times. This is still very strong and well below the office average of 6.8 times according to SNL. But we intend to bring it back to 4.5 range in the intermediate term.	Before turning the call over to the operator, I wanted to again reaffirm the earnings guidance we provided in early January. There are no changes to our estimated FFO range or the assumptions behind it.	In closing, no doubt about it. Our quarterly financial results were complex. But don't let that complexity hide the fact that we accomplished quite a bit during the fourth quarter, all while generating terrific operating results. We’ve worked hard to make sure 2017 will be a less complex. We want to ensure that you, our investors, have a clear line of sight, the power of the company we've created and it's quite a company. It's an exciting time here at Cousins. Thanks for your patience and support and with that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.	Jamie Feldman	Good morning. So I guess the first question, the same store guidance of 2% to 4%, is that the entire portfolio or is that just the seven Cousins assets that you quote in the supplemental?	Gregg Adzema	Hey Jamie, it’s Gregg. Good morning. So we will add two additional assets to the same property pool that was there in the fourth quarter, those assets are Northpark in Atlanta, Fifth Third Center in Charlotte. Those are two big assets, which will increase the same property portion of our total NOI from about 18% to about 31% during 2017, assuming we don't sell or buy anything else. So it's bigger in ’17 than it was in ’16. There's a couple additional assets.	Jamie Feldman	Okay, but -- so you're giving us the internal growth guidance of 2% to 4% but that's really not, it's only still a third of the portfolio, do you have a sense of what that number looks like for the entire portfolio?	Gregg Adzema	Jamie as I said in the prepared remarks, we're going to take a look at providing incremental information in 2017. I think it will give you a little more transparency into the performance of the whole portfolio in ‘17 relative to ’16. But that will be in addition to our consistently provided same property performance that will definitely provide, the 2% to 4% that we talked about refers to that 9 property portfolio I talked about, that represents 31% of the total portfolio.	Jamie Feldman	So maybe just your gut feel of what do you think internal growth is for the whole business?	Colin Connolly	Jamie, there is -- as we look forward to 2017 and on, I think the growth trajectory of the company looks very attractive. The rents across our portfolio continue to be below market, roughly 10%, I think, is the number that I've provided in the past, as we look forward to 2017 I think it’s important to look at -- we do have a portfolio that continues to in-shop from a percentage lease standpoint and we do not have a whole lot of expirations over the course of the next couple years and if you look at our supplement relative to our peers our rollover profile in 2017-18 and ’19 is relatively low and that’s a testament to the fantastic job the team has done getting in front of some of those expirations. But again I think as highlighted by the quarter that we just had in the leasing activity in the continued roll up in our rents, I think you'll continue to see that translate into ’17 and beyond.	Jamie Feldman	And then any latest thoughts on market concentration and if you tell maybe some of the Florida markets.	Larry Gellerstedt	Jamie, when we look at the Florida markets we're excited because it's sort of piggybacking on what Colin just said, we do have vacancy there. And we're very focused in Tampa in particular as the pipeline has picked up and we think we'll have some positive things to announce during the balance of the year. So our focus on the Florida markets is continue to get to go, to know them better but take advantage of this vacancy and get it leased up to create value for the shareholders.	As we look to the balance of the company, the thing that we will absolutely do is stay disciplined with urban assets in the best sub markets and we will look for opportunities for those within all of our existing cities but we also continue to look at other cities in the sunbelt, where we can get that dynamic that has led to the success that we've had with our current strategy which is trying to get best urban markets near transit, best buildings and in an environment where we think our operating approach to doing business will be successful. And so we'll look both with our existing portfolio as well as continue to look for other opportunities outside that portfolio.	Colin Connolly	And Jamie, just to add on to Larry's comments, in addition to looking for new opportunities whether being some of our existing markets or potential new markets is your question regarding growth. Again we do have organic growth through below market rents but to kind of echo our earlier comments from our scripts, we've got a fantastic development pipeline of about $500 million. That today we think pro-forma could be in the high 80s on a percentage lease basis. So you'll start to see that that pipeline begin to deliver in the later part of this year and 2018. So that's going to be a fantastic growth opportunity for the company and we'll continue to look for new opportunities certainly in a disciplined manner.	Jamie Feldman	And then just last question for me, thinking about the CapEx needs for the year, what are your thoughts based on the guidance of where you might end up on the FFO and is there room about the distribution in 2017?	Gregg Adzema	Jamie, it’s Gregg. We don't provide AFFO guidance, we just provide FFO guidance. So I'm going to comment pass on that comment in terms of providing AFFO guidance. In terms distributions we do drive our distribution decisions off of AFFO, it’s decision made by the board every quarter. But when we right sized the dividend to reflect the Parkway distribution in the fourth quarter we right-sized it with an eye towards ’17. And so I think you should probably expect very little if any change to our dividend distributions in ’17 versus what we just did for the fourth quarter ‘16.	Operator	Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick from Capital One.	Tom Lesnick	Hi guys good morning. My first question on the investment sales environment in Atlanta, particularly for multifamily assets, we've heard some comments from players in the apartment industry about fewer bids out there for assets right now and cap rate is potentially taking a little higher. How are you guys thinking about the environment for your Emory asset?	Colin Connolly	A great question and we have seen an overall, I’d characterize spinning bidder pool in the multifamily space, and perhaps a slight pullback from some of the institutional -- larger institutional investors and that could lead to a creep in cap rates. I think some of that's a function in the multifamily space of the supply that's out there which is certainly a bit different profile than what we see in the office space today. But I think as we look at Emory Point it's important to point out that the incredible infill location that we have there adjacent to the CDC and Emory University and if there's one area in Atlanta that is then under supplied and supply constrained at that particular sub-market.	Tom Lesnick	That's helpful. And then on ACS, I believe you guys have historically talked about that side being potential demand from the data center community, what are you guys seeing there?	Colin Connolly	Yeah, I think it's -- that is an asset that -- as Larry mentioned will likely bring to the market in the relatively near future. I think it's going to be a very attractive opportunity for a wide ranging group of investors. As you mentioned there is a data center component, it's a bit of a hybrid given the network and fiber that runs underneath Atlanta. Today I'd say that it's roughly 25% or so of the square footage comprises of data center customers with 75% of the office side. So as we bring that out we hope to see good interest from not only office investors but potentially some of the technology oriented real estate investors as well.	Tom Lesnick	And I guess shifting gears, Gregg, other companies have undergone reverse splits in the last couple of years with some success. And just given that you guys are kind of going along here at $0.15 to $0.16 and consensus appears to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Is there any inclination on your part to pursue that and potentially increase the share price and per share metrics?	Gregg Adzema	Well, clearly we're trading below $10 which kind of puts that on the table. We're not at $2 or $3 or $4 which we’d absolutely put at front of the stable. But that’s the best decision for the board, we talk about it, if that's something we decide to pursue, we will be transparent with you all going forward.	Tom Lesnick	Appreciate that and then last one for me. I'm sorry if I missed it but were there any residual costs from the merger that are expected to be expensed in 2017 from a timing perspective?	Larry Gellerstedt	Tom, included in our 2017 guidance is a range of between $1 million and $3 million of additional lingering transaction costs that will run through 2017 numbers.	Operator	Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Sun Trust.	Michael Lewis	You mentioned a big lease, and you signed that Northpark, that just happens that their next lease overall 100,000 square feet, it’s not calling every 29 theme but it's also at Northpark. So I was just wondering if there's visibility into that and if that mark-to-market you kind is kind of consistent with the roughly 10%, that caller spoke to pretty overall credit.	Colin Connolly	Michael, it's Colin and you're right. Our next large exploration at Northpark aside from the Equifax moveout which we've mentioned in August of this year, is AIG in 2019. It's a bit too early to project but we have had a great relationship with those folks, the dialogue continues. I think it's just a bit premature for them but that is certainly something that we will be very focused.	In terms of the specific mark to market, again I don't want to provide guidance on a specific lease upcoming rollover like that from a competitive standpoint. But we do see really good opportunity at Northpark across the board to continue to roll rents to market. And that particular lease wouldn't be any different. I just want to shy away from the specifics as we begin this conversation.	Michael Lewis	Understand, particularly in terms of the development portfolio obviously a lot of wealth-ish projects and build to suite, Carolina Square lease-up, it looks like there's some leasing to do it at 8000 Avalon. I think Colin may have mentioned a lease there. But is there any color you could provide kind of under-demand [ph] there and then also more broadly Atlanta's been a strong market. Are there any signs of a slowdown in activity or kind of demand?	Gregg Adzema	I would say Atlanta continues to have strong demand. We haven't seen any dip, in terms of leased volume, I mean the total square footage lease in the city of ’16 is a little lower than it was in fifteen but we -- just like the police, we just executed WestRock, we continue to see good opportunities in the best buildings near transit to drive good results.	In terms of Avalon, usually when we do a building like this. Our goal is to be sort of in the 40% to 55% leased range when the building opens because particularly in a mixed use environment like Avalon, a lot of it is less people see. So they can understand the true value offering that we have there and I'm confident we'll be in that range by the time we open it. The pipeline looks really strong and we're feeling confident about where 8000 Avalon sits.	Operator	Our next question comes from Jed Reagan with Green Street Advisors.	Jed Reagan	Good morning guys. Can you talk about the expected timing for somebody lumpier ’17, dispositions, are there any taxable games, you may need to protect your payout with ACSC or Emory Point.	Colin Connolly	It’s Colin. I will tackle the first half of that from a timing perspective. Our goal with those Emory Point and ACSC, is to be in the market here very shortly and would like to try to get this done in the first half of the year or they could create creep over a month or two depending on the specific timeline of the deal. But we're focused on moving this forward this process is now.	Gregg Adzema	Jed, good morning. It's Gregg. In terms of the taxability of those two asset sales whether they require a special distribution on our part, the answer is currently no. We don't anticipate either of those sales generating the requirement for special distribution.	Jed Reagan	And you mentioned a little bit earlier just, you know, potential external growth opportunities. Just wondered if you could offer any more on and kind of how you're thinking about the acquisition environment today and if there are any build to suite opportunities you're pursuing that might hit in ’17?	Larry Gellerstedt	Jed, this is Larry. We continue to see some build to suite opportunities not anything that we can see on the very short term horizon. But those things pop up. Usually where you a quarter or two in advance and you're pursuing and you have a little bit better things we don't have any visibility on anything in our portfolio that I would put in that sort of short timeframe.	Gregg Adzema	In terms of the acquisition market as we look both within our own portfolio and cities as well as future cities we look at is the importance of a our balance sheet strategy if when we start to see, markets that meet our standards in terms of where we want to be. We also want to be patient and make sure we buy assets at the right time to get the kind of results that our portfolio demands and that's the reason we're, as Gregg said keeping our powder dry.	Jed Reagan	Can you just run through quickly maybe Colin, how the rent growth environment is looking across some of your markets, maybe just the range for the kind of rent growth if any that you guys are observing currently?	Colin Connolly	Yeah, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and we've seen very very significant growth in Austin, double digit type growth. Certainly there's been fantastic opportunities for us to drive rental growth in Tempe. We're also seeing that here in Atlanta, kind of order of magnitude, Jed, over the last year or two it's ranged anywhere from 5% to 10%. Florida has been a little bit slower too than some of our other markets in Tampa and Orlando. It's been a little bit more moderate probably closer to inflation type ranges 2% to 3%. But as both of those markets have now tightened, we're optimistic that we will see a catch up in both of those.	Jed Reagan	Okay, 5% to 10% also applies to Atlanta.	Colin Connolly	Yeah, we’ve seen that. I would say that the Tempe’s and Austins have been at the higher end of that range and I'd say that the Atlanta and Charlotte have been closer to that kind of five percent range with Tampa and Orlando closer to inflation like levels.	Jed Reagan	And then just last one for me, I think you guys had originally outlined about $85 million of expected merger costs and I think you recorded what 30% million or so far, a couple more couple million more program in ‘17. Were you able to just execute lower cost than expected or did Parkway end up shouldering a little more of the burden or how did that play out?	Gregg Adzema	Hey Ted, it’s Gregg. Lot of the transaction costs went on Parkway’s books at or before the time of the merger. So you won't see the full 85 show through our numbers because it's a combination of our expenses and theirs. But when you combine the two together we believe that the total transaction costs are going to come in right around $85 million and then we're going to hit that line.	Operator	[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.	John Guinee	Thank you. So good morning. Just a few quick ones. Colin, do you think you can exceed the outstanding debt on the sale of the ACSC building?	Gregg Adzema	We do, we're very confident of that.	John Guinee	Second, just to clarify the dividend has been reset at about $0.06 per quarter.	Gregg Adzema	Yet exactly $0.06 sure.	John Guinee	Third, 191 Peachtree sale, Cousins re-up there or are you going to relocate into a Cousins owned building.	Gregg Adzema	We will relocate this summer to a Cousins zone building.	John Guinee	Which one?	Gregg Adzema	3344 in Buckhead.	John Guinee	And then I guess Colin or maybe -- NCR, if I'm doing the math right looks like it's going to cost about $445 a square foot, Avalon looks like it's going to cost about 3.25, and the Dimension building in Charlotte about 2.50 a square foot. First if those numbers are accurate, let me know and then can you talk a little bit about the difference in what you're delivering for those widely different prices --	Larry Gellerstedt	First, those are our GAAP numbers which does incrementally increase those costs a bit relative to a cash number. And so the key differentiator is as you kind of go across those particular assets that you mentioned, the NCR deal was ultimately done on a return on cost basis, let’s say, the amount of TI, that went in there was maybe a little bit higher given the build to suite nature of that and some of their tech requirements. And so that pushed that project costs up a bit. The Avalon, it’s a little over 300,000 a square foot and I think it’s representative of a kind of mid rise suburban project with a structured parking. The Dimensional funded by your projects you referenced what's missing there from a project cost standpoint is dimensional decided to fund their tenant improvements outside of our transaction. And so you would have to add a market TI to that to get to a kind of a more normalized market level development costs.	John Guinee	And have you quoted any expected yield on cost for these development deals?	Gregg Adzema	We have not provided specifics per project in the past, we have referenced on a GAAP basis that the return on costs is in the mid eighty's on the projects on a blended basis.	Operator	And our final question for today is a follow up from Jed Reagan from Green Street Advisors.	Mr Reagan, is it possible that your phone is on mute?	Jed Reagan	Yes, thank you. Just on kind of market selection you've got the Carolina Square project, which obviously is delivering in the Raleigh Durham area. Is that a market you'd like to expand in or is that likely to be more kind of a one off there?	Larry Gellerstedt	Raleigh Durham market is one that we have looked at. I wouldn't say it's on the top of our list going forward. Various reasons, so I would look at the Carolina Square is more of a one-off opportunity although that always can change, as cities change and demographics change but it would not be on the top of our list.	End of Q&A	Operator	And ladies and gentlemen at this time I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.	Larry Gellerstedt	We as always appreciate your interest in our company. 2016 was obviously a fantastic year and we are optimistic as we look forward to ‘17 and appreciate your continued interest. If you have any questions, as always the management team is available and just feel free to reach out. Thanks so much.	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.	I'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.	Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining Akamai's fourth quarter and year-end 2016 earnings conference call.	Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.	Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.	Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on February 7, 2016. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to further reflect future events or circumstances.	As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of our website.	And with that, please let me turn the call over to Tom.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today.	Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai with accelerated revenue growth and excellent earnings and free cash flow. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $616 million, up 7% year-over-year on constant currency. The strong revenue result was driven by robust seasonal traffic in Media, the continued rapid growth of our Cloud Security Solutions, and the success of our recently launched new products. Of particular note, revenue from our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million in Q4, up 41% over Q4 in 2015.	Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.72 per diluted share, consistent year-over-year and up 8% when adjusted for the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that benefited Q4 of 2015.	Cash generation continued to be strong, free cash flow of $106 million in Q4 bringing full-year free cash flow to $550 million, up 72% from 2015 levels.	As we discussed during our recent calls, our overall revenue growth rates in 2016 were lower because of the do-it-yourself or DIY efforts by a few of the Internet's largest platform companies. If we exclude the impact of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix from our results, then our Q4 revenue was $558 million, which is up 15% over Q4 of last year in constant currency.	Revenue for 2016 as a whole was $2.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year and up 15% excluding the six large Internet platform companies. Our exposure to DIY in these accounts continue to diminish as they collectively accounted for less than 10% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter, down from roughly 16% a year ago. As a result, our overall revenue growth rate accelerated in Q4 due to the continued strong growth of our core business.	As I look back at 2016, I'm especially pleased with the success of Akamai's innovation engine. We released several new products last year, including Bot Manager, Image Manager and Enterprise Application Access, and their reception in the marketplace has been very positive. Bot Manager, in particular, has proven to be our most popular new product in several years. Bot Manager identifies nearly 1,400 types of bots and enables our customers to customize their response to requests based on the type of bot. We sell Bot Manager across all our major verticals and for a variety of uses. I recently spoke to one major enterprise that is saving many millions of dollars a year because of Bot Manager's ability to identify and mitigate price scrapers.	Our recent acquisition of Cyberfend is intended to further enhance Bot Manager's market-leading capabilities by providing even greater defenses against credential abuse. For many of our customers, a large fraction of the login attempts are from bots checking to see if stolen user credentials are valid on their sites. Validated credentials are then sold to criminal organizations for exploitation. By incorporating the Cyberfend technology into Bot Manager, we can more effectively stop these attacks then tell our customers which user IDs have been compromised.	Our new Image Manager solution has also gotten off to a very strong start in the market. Image Manager automatically optimizes images by creating and delivering the right size image for each user in real time based on the device type, browser type, and quality of connection. The solution enables our customers to accelerate their time to market, improve performance and conversion rates, especially for mobile apps and also to reduce their costs.	Last year we formed our Enterprise and Carrier Division, and I'm happy to report that we're now entering the market with two exciting new products to improve enterprise security, Enterprise Application Access and Enterprise Threat Detection.	Using technology acquired from Soha Systems in October, Enterprise Application Access, or EAA, addresses the growing need for businesses to more easily and securely manage application access for a growing mix of users with different risk profiles. EAA does not require enterprises to poke holes in their corporate firewall to enable access, which greatly improves security over traditional VPN solutions. EAA is also much easier to integrate and use than traditional remote access solutions.	Close on the heels of EAA is our new Enterprise Threat Protector or ETP service. ETP is now in beta with 15 customers. It helps companies block access to malware sites and data exfiltration botnets. Just like EAA, Enterprise Threat Protector is very easy to set up. Unlike most enterprise security products, ETP can be deployed and configured in under 30 minutes. Nearly all of the customers in our beta program have been able to get it up and running totally on their own.	EAA and ETP are attractive solutions for a wide variety of enterprises providing Akamai with an opportunity to pursue new customers and verticals. For example, manufacturing companies will be able to use ETP to block threats without needing to deploy and maintain on-prem hardware.	In addition to our successful new product introductions, our core business also remained strong in 2016 with a especially robust growth in our OTT business. Following a record-breaking Euro 2016 and Rio Olympics, we set a new record for a news event on the night of the U.S. elections, with 7.5 terabits per second of peak delivery, and during the holiday season the Akamai platform achieved a new traffic record of 46 terabits per second, doubling our 2014 peak of 23 terabits per second.	The global adoption of OTT has continued at a strong pace, not only in the U.S. but also in EMEA and especially in Asia and Latin America. Our experience and expertise in streaming video at scale with quality and reliability around the world means that we are in an excellent position to benefit from the increasing demand for high-quality content online.	Of course, security remains the most pressing concern for many of our customers, as the scale and sophistication of cyber attacks have continued to escalate along with the potential for disruption and damage. In 2016, the number of DDoS attacks launched against our customers grew by 75% over 2015.	We're very proud of our excellent track record of successfully defending our customers from some of the Web's largest and most malicious attacks. We believe that our unique approach of leveraging a distributed network of servers at the edge of the Internet, where there is enormous capacity, continues to be a critical differentiator for Akamai.	Just this morning, we announced our new Web Application Protector service, which is designed to provide online businesses with a low touch way to protect their websites from the most common attacks. We also announced enhancements to our flagship Kona Site Defender solution to defend APIs from a wide range of both DDoS and application layer attacks. APIs are emerging as a popular target for attackers as the usage of mobile devices continues to grow.	Over the last four years, we've grown our Cloud Security business from a little more than an idea into a $400 million market leader. We believe that our remarkable success in Cloud Security demonstrates that with prudent investment, we can create substantial new and profitable revenue streams beyond our core CDN business.	As we look to the future, we see several opportunities with similar growth potential, and so we are planning to increase investment in 2017 to capitalize on these opportunities to further accelerate our long-term revenue growth. Our goal is to replicate the success that we've had with our Cloud Security business in other adjacent areas where the scale, resiliency and security of our unique distributed edge platform can enable us to provide compelling cloud solutions to our customers.	This investment strategy will pressure margins in the near term, but we believe it will help accelerate revenue growth in the longer term. Of course, as always, we'll continue to keep a close eye on overall expense and to carefully track performance as we grow the business. We'll talk more about our plans for product expansion at our Investor Day on March 14, and as we make key investments.	In summary, I remain confident in our business strategy, our market position and our ability to execute on the significant opportunities for growth that lie ahead. I have never been more optimistic about our future.	I'll now turn the call to Jim to review our Q4 financial results and to provide the outlook for Q1. Jim?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.	As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements. Revenue was up a healthy 15% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers Tom just mentioned.	Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers. I mentioned in our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance, and it did. Media-related traffic was particularly strong in the quarter.	Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency.	Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers. We saw healthy seasonal traffic growth in both our gaming and software download verticals and continued robust growth in video delivery.	Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines. As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings.	Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million, up 41% year-over-year, capping off another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our security solutions globally. Exiting Q4, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run-rate of over $400 million.	We are very pleased with the growth and execution of our Cloud Security business over the past few years. This growth was driven by targeted product innovation and go-to-market resource investments, as well as a very successful acquisition. We plan to maintain this aggressive investment posture to further broaden not only our Cloud Security offerings, but also our Web performance and emerging enterprise solution capabilities where we see substantial long-term growth potential.	Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year.	Turning now to our Q4 customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $300 million, up 14% year-over-year. We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings.	Revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers. This strong growth rate was driven not only by Media Division customers driving more holiday season traffic. but also from upgrading and penetrating more of Akamai's solutions deeper into this customer base.	Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.	Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter. International revenue was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up 19%, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter.	Revenue from our U.S. market was $424 million, up 2% year-over-year. If you exclude the large Internet Platform Customers, which are based in the U.S., revenue growth was a solid 13% across the rest of the business.	Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in-line with our guidance. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance due to the strong revenue achievement.	GAAP operating expenses were $289 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels.	This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases.	Moving in to 2017, we expect to see similar elevated levels of litigation spend.	Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance.	GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $84 million in the fourth quarter. These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million consistent with Q3 levels and at the low end of our guidance due to the timing of some network deployments that shifted into Q1.	Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $174 million, up $10 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% consistent with Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance.	Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $4 million, consistent with Q3 levels. Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million. As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results.	Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million or $0.52 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range driven by higher revenues and a slightly lower tax rate. Adjusting for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in Q4 2015, earnings grew 8% year-over-year.	For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27%. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.	For the full year, the 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate was just above 29%. Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 175 million shares and in line with our guidance.	Now I'll review some balance sheet items.	Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 54 days, down 2 days from Q3 levels. Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $78 million and slightly below our guidance for the quarter primarily due to the timing of network buildouts that moved into Q1.	For the full year 2016, capital expenditures came in at 14% of revenue and below our long-term model as we grew into our existing capacity from the significant 2015 buildouts. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be back in line with our long-term model range.	Cash flow generation continue to be strong in Q4. Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter and $550 million for the year or 24% of revenue. Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. If you'll factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion.	During the quarter we spent $79 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.3 million shares. For the year, we spent $374 million buying back approximately 7 million shares.	In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter.	In addition, we expect further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the past few months. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of just under $4 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year.	Factoring in both of these variables, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $596 million to $610 million. At the higher end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q4 levels.	At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $217 million to $222 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels primarily due to less commission spend and fewer customer events.	Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%. And as mentioned earlier, we plan to significantly increase our investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling – important areas we believe will help us enable to drive accelerated, sustainable long-term growth and scale.	And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q1 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to grow investments throughout 2017 at a faster pace than revenue growth. Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term. We are confident the success we have had with our Cloud Security investment strategy can be duplicated in other areas of the business, most notably in our new and emerging Enterprise Solutions portfolio. We also plan to broaden our offerings within our Security, Web Performance and Media Solutions portfolios. This deliberate investment strategy will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and for the foreseeable future.	Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million. Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69.	This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just under 29.5%. This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 175 million shares.	On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business. We expect to spend approximately $90 million and $96 million, excluding equity compensation.	It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development. As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017.	In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term. We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 14.	Thank you. And now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.	Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC	Great. Thanks. You talked about these – the contribution from the three newer products – Bot Manager, Image Manager and the Enterprise and Carrier Division products. Could you help us think through the revenue ramp? In other words, how widely sold across the verticals are all three of those products? And when do you think that they'll be at a point where they'll be fully penetrated? Does that take 6 months, 12 months, 2 years? Thank you.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, I'll take that. But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base. But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year.	Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days. But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio. You'll see that continue to ramp and further penetrate in 2018, but it's probably going to take a couple of years to see it kind of fully penetrated.	As an example for Cloud Security, which we've been in market now for a little over four years. I think about 38% of our customers via Cloud Security Solutions. So still a lot of ramp to go even in Cloud Security, so it takes a while to have those customers ramp, but you can certainly see that we started a few years ago from roughly a few million dollars in Cloud Security to now over $400 million.	So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company.	Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC	Thank you, Jim.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Maguire from CLSA. Your question, please.	Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC	Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss the competitive environment for your anti-DDoS services, particularly with AWS getting into the market. What sort of competition are you seeing there, and are there also other opportunities where you are seeing cross-selling and attach for the anti-DDoS services?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. We're in a good position with the DDoS solution because of our unique distributed platform. We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures. AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace. For DDoS, it would be a different kind of approach. So we don't see that as being a significant threat to the DDoS business.	And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai.	Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC	Great. And just to follow up on the – with the declines in revenue from the Internet Platform Customers, do you believe that you've reached a point of stability where the predictability of the migration away from your platform has reached an equilibrium of sorts?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years.	Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC	Great. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Your question, please.	Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wondering if you could go in a bit more detail about some of the enterprise opportunities you're investing in outside of security, I guess, specifically on the Web performance side, and how you see those kind of markets transpiring today from a sales standpoint whether there's head count additions you need to make to broaden the distribution and kind of how those products are attaching alongside the Security Solutions?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Right. As we talked about with Image Manager that's a Web Performance Solution, very pleased with the early traction there. The new Ion 3 (31:30) solution has an SDK for a substantially improved performance especially for mobile devices and prepositioning of content. And as we make major investments this year, we'll talk about those as we make them. And we move into a new product area, then we'll talk about it then. Of course, it will be important that it's synergistic with the existing business and that can leverage Akamai's unique distributed platform.	Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Okay, thanks. And then just one other on the share count guidance. It looks like you're kind of looking at a flat year-over-year share count. Just wondering if the increased CapEx expectations is at all kind of limiting the buyback in 2017 relative to what you repurchased in 2016?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback. And as we talked about, our share buyback is intended to offset dilution, but it's a programmatic trade that buys more shares when the stock price is lower and buys fewer shares when the stock price is higher. But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A.	Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.	Okay. Thank you very much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley. Your question, please.	Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC	Yeah. Thank you very much. I can understand if you don't want to talk about some of these new adjacencies that you're entering into, but can you give us what the profile of the company would look like? Are these products primarily SaaS-based so that you have an initial CapEx spend, but maybe at a later time that CapEx spend goes down and you get what you listed as a recurring revenue stream?	And the second question would be, any initial take on net neutrality? Obviously, the new administration is taking a pretty tough stance. Where do you think you stand on that? And do you think you'll benefit from it or potential negatives some point down the line?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, of course. We're in a business with recurring revenue streams, and so any new areas we would go into you would think would be consistent with that model. So I wouldn't expect any major deviation there.	In terms of acquisitions we've done over the past, there's technology tuck-ins. Sometimes there's a product like Prolexic that's an adjacency that fits very well with our existing business, but is a new product that's very synergistic. And occasionally, over our 20-year history we've done some roll-ups. It's less frequent, I would say. And I don't think there would be a major difference in the kinds of things that we're planning to do this year from what we've done in the past.	With net neutrality, I think there's going to be changes there with the new administration. I think a lot of rules that existed before may go away, and I don't think that really makes much difference to our business. We weren't regulated in the first place, and I don't see anything coming there that would be bad in any way for Akamai.	Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC	Thank you	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell from JMP Securities. Your question, please.	Unknown Speaker	Hi. This is Richard Deloria (35:04) dialing in for Greg. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to kind of follow up on the head count question that was asked earlier, I mean because we did see a bit of an uptick in hiring this quarter.	With the increased product development focus and maybe a little bit more of a vertical focus within the Enterprise Division, how are you thinking about head count going forward not just for next quarter and later into 2017 but kind of beyond that? Can you see a return to normal head count growth that we've seen in the past? Or is it going to be a little more deliberate? And I have one follow-up.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments. You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions. I think in years past, we averaged more than 1,000 hires per year.	I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation.	There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly. And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform. So you should expect head count more similar to what it's been in the past than basically what it's been in 2016.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. And then just kind of a quick follow-up. Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of – and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media.	Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong. We had a large number of gaming releases, a fair number of software download events that the Media business can be a bit spiky that way. So some – I'd say the bigger part of the sequential decline is driven by the Media business, certainly not the performance in Security Solutions.	Unknown Speaker	Got it. Thank you so much.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.	Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.	Yeah, thanks. Hi, Tom, Jim. A consistent question I hear from clients is whether Akamai is an episodic growth story, and I think where they're coming from is the Media Delivery business does extremely well during live events. We saw recently the elections, holiday season, on and on. I think what they're looking for is any data points or trends you could help us with to get all of us comfortable about the slow to mid-teens trajectory for the Media business now that we're lapping to DIY customers. And 2017 is a prime number year, so how would we feel comfortable with no major live events on the calendar this year? Thanks.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, I don't know if it has too much to do with prime numbers. Even years there are more events, but as we've talked about in the past, any given event gives us some revenue, but it's not really swinging the needle. Now sometimes with Olympics and so forth new devices will come out and someday like VR, for example, we've started to do some of that, and that can drive traffic levels on a more sustained basis afterwards.	But I wouldn't read a lot into that, and I think the Media business is very healthy. We're seeing very strong growth in OTT, very strong growth in our gaming customers and just Modulo the very big, the six platform companies that are doing more on their own, the Media business has been very good.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue. So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business.	So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates. I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing. And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now. But if you see that become more mainstream, I think we're poised to benefit significantly from that.	Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.	Perfect. A quick follow-on would be, do you see any cross-sell, upsell synergies between your gaming customers and DDoS? A common complaint from gamers is performance is weak because of DDoS attacks, hacker attacks, et cetera. And I think, they complain no matter what, but still do you see any synergies in gaming and the Security business? Thanks.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, you're right. I think the gaming vertical is probably as attacked as any. And so they are large adopters of DDoS prevention services from Akamai.	Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.	Perfect. Thanks.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.	Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Excellent. Nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. Following up on OTT, just to kind of help us mark-to-market, you talked about the steady growth. One, are we getting to a point where it's actually sort of materially driving the numbers in either Media or Performance in terms of that's a significant driver of revenues today?	And two, when we think about the uptick in CapEx spend into 2017, is that by any means based upon an anticipation of more OTT revenues, or is it more of the traditional businesses that are growing out that (41:48) CapEx?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, I'll parse that. So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT. It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur.	And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those – the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky. And you'll have surges at times and then it won't at other times. So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT. I don't think you're going to see the catalyst. You may see even a catalyst, as Tom mentioned, as you see more VR and things like that in the gaming space that require performance to work well, but I think that between things like that and OTT, that's going to be the cause of kind of re-acceleration in the Media business.	And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT. Actually, the build-out that we're doing is, as you can imagine, our Security business now is on an annualized run-rate of over $400 million. It's rapidly growing. And so there's build-out we're doing to support our Security business. And there's also build-out that we're doing with our secure delivery network. More customers want to have their traffic served over a secure delivery network, so we're building out capacity in that area. So it's really for other parts of the business. It's not so much for the Media business.	Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC	Excellent. Thank you. That was very helpful.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.	Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities	Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the Security business, you mentioned like it's already $400 million run-rate, while also you invested and you made a few tuck-in acquisition second half of last year and also introduced new products, I'm wondering how big is an opportunity at this point to cross-sell this within your installed base. How much penetrated at this point? And how sustainable is this 40% growth in Security business? And I have a follow-up.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Well, the cross-sell opportunity is very strong. And as I mentioned earlier, we also entered new accounts leading with security quite often. So it's good both ways.	Growing at 40% is really great to see. That obviously gets harder as the numbers get larger, but we're excited about Bot Manager and the Cyberfend acquisition, as well as the new products that we're bringing to market in enterprise security. So that's an area where we'll be continuing to make investments in order to maintain strong growth rates.	Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities	And with this new introduction of those new product and acquisitions, are you making any changes to your go-to-market strategy, or what are the other investments you're planning to do?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	With the new enterprise products, we have an overlay team, but we expect with those products that our existing sales force can sell them. They're both easy to explain. And as I mentioned, easy to use and integrate and get going. And so I think our existing sales force is going to be able to sell those. And right now, we're helping them with an overlay.	Sitikantha Panigrahi - Wells Fargo Securities	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Your question, please.	Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company	Great. Thank you. You mentioned, too, you're obviously going to be investing in the business, and for the year, we should see EBITDA margins in, I think, you said high 30s. And I think you also mentioned that the intention is to get back up to double-digit growth.	So I guess my question is for the company to continue to grow at double-digit growth beyond 2017 into the next few years hopefully, do you think that you have to remain in the high 30s and therefore, that's the new long-term operating margin for the business – or EBITDA margin for the business? Or do you think this is more of a one-time investment through 2017, and then as we go into 2018 and beyond, we can potentially get back up to that 40% type EBITDA margin? Thanks.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Thanks for the question, Colby. I mean, we'll cover it more at the upcoming Investor Summit, but I still think the long-term model for the company in the low 40s is the right one. I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter. And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas. Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017.	And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s. But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA. But I think that even beyond 2017, we intend to operate the company in the high 30s. And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA. But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment. We want to make sure we're investing to capitalize on that because now is the opportunity.	Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company	Great. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your question, please.	James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC	Thanks. Just want to clarify one thing, and then just follow up the question. On the CapEx you talked about significantly going up, but still within the 16% to 18% range? That's my understanding.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yes, yes.	James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC	Okay.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	That means we were 14% in 2016. We'll be back in the 16% to 18% range in 2017.	James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC	Great. And then just on new sales and where the revenue growth is coming from as you look across sort of Security, Performance and Media as three separate segments, is it adding new customers? Is it existing customers taking more services? And does that differ across those segments? Thanks.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base. We've been able to take the offerings that we have and further penetrate them into the installed base. I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them. You can expand it via other offerings.	But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base. And there's still a significant opportunity to do more there. I mentioned earlier that 38% of our customers buy security, so that means there's an opportunity for 62% of customers to actually buy one of our Security Solutions.	And so I think you're going to see that we're going to further penetrate the offerings, and I think as we bring more innovation to the table, there's more of an opportunity to sell more into the installed base. And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that.	James Breen - William Blair & Co. LLC	Great. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird. Your question, please.	Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.	Great. Thank you. Yeah. Just to maybe come back on the Security area. Tom, you referenced the strength in Bot Manager, that being one of the most successful newer products you've had in the last couple of years. And you've got a couple of the new Enterprise Security products, which I realized are early, but I'm wondering if you could just help us maybe frame how we should think about the market size opportunities for each of those, Bot Manager and Enterprise, perhaps relative to your DDoS market, and what you're doing in Security today?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	I think they're very large. Now Bot Manager fits in with our Kona Site Defender and the Web security product space. And Bot Manager's market is at least as big as Kona, and we're seeing that in terms of the ARPUs with customers that are adopting that.	EAA and ETP are on the Enterprise side, and that's a new market for us to go into. That's a market that's traditionally used devices that are purchased by the IT manager, operated in the private network. I think as we go to the future, you're going to see those capabilities sold as cloud services in a recurring revenue market, and we're bringing those kinds of products to market now to help that fundamental change in enterprise architecture and enterprise security.	In the long run, I think the services for enterprise networking and security have a bigger TAM than Web delivery and security. Of course, it's just at the beginning, so it'll take a long time to catch up, but there's a lot more money spent in enterprise networking than there is in Content Delivery. And I think the term often you'll hear in the industry is enterprise networking is turning inside out, and I think you'll be seeing the adoption of cloud services replacing the purchase of devices operated by the IT manager and the WAM (52:07).	Will V. Power - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your question, please.	Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.	Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Can I see if we could maybe put a finer point on the top six question? I know you said it would decline in 1Q, but is 1Q the point where it bottoms as a percentage of revenue? And is there any – especially the top four because those are the material ones, that might be up for renewal later in the year where there might be some risk to that bottoming out of those six as a percentage of revenue?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	No. As we talked about, I think as a percentage of revenue we expect or certainly prefer to see a decline in percentage of revenue. First, you have the rest of the business, the core business over 90% growing at a very strong clip, and I think these six of which there's really three that are larger today quite possibly could decline in the revenue they pay us, which would mean their percentage would continue to decrease.	And as we look to the future sort of that's the way we're thinking, of course, we're going to do everything we can to maximize revenue in those accounts. I think we provide them tremendous value and three of them are still sizable customers, and I think will always be sizable customers for Akamai.	Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.	And then as I said, any of the top four – I guess, the top three are that ones that you're focusing on, that would be a risk in the back half of the year as far as renewals?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	I don't think there's so much of an issue there and the impact that any one of them can have is now much less than it used to be, so I don't think that's an issue really to be thinking about. I think the key is they're less than 10% today. We're anticipating further declines certainly as a percentage of revenues through the year and potentially in the future. But I don't think there's any giant event in a single quarter associated with any one customer.	Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.	I'm going to try and squeeze one more in, sorry, but I don't know if you guys want to, but any thoughts about trying to give us a sense for what depreciation should be for next year, so we end up getting not just EBITDA but below the line right as well?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue. And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way.	Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.	Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.	Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)	Thanks. So just two clarifications. Tom, can you give us your best guess maybe on the top six of what's going on? Is it just one or two that are still kind of really seeing declining revenues and maybe a guess on where they can bottom out as a percentage of revenue? Is it 8% of revenue, 4% of revenue, just any more color around that would be great? And I had a quick follow-up.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. No, we're not giving guidance at that level of detail, (55:15) to say we expect some further declines not at the rate we've already seen, obviously, because now they're less than 10% of our total revenue. And this is associated with these companies spend billions of dollars a year in infrastructure generally, and they're doing more the delivery themselves. I think we still provide them significant value. And of course, I'd like to see the revenue there increase as we go forward, but we're not expecting to have that happen.	Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)	Great. And then on the OTT video side, can you maybe talk about why is it accelerating now? What's kind of come together? And a few of the offerings seem to be off to a rocky start in terms of quality, can you talk about it? Is that because of the CDN bottleneck, or is there some other bottlenecks? And maybe just lastly on the OTT front, how do you think your quality is kind of comparing to your competitors in the OTT front? Thanks.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. I'd say OTT is growing at a very solid pace. It hasn't exploded. At times people think that might happen, but that's not taken place. I think there's a lot of new offers out there – continue to be new offers. People are going to try lots of different kinds of things, and some will have more success than others in the marketplace. It is a very hard thing to do. Just even the delivery of the videos at high levels of quality is very hard, and that's where we really excel. And so we get a significant share of that market and as it grows, we should be in a position to benefit from it. And there's other things besides the delivery that are complicated technically, things involving ads, with ads supported OTT, very complicated to do, and there's a lot of players in the ecosystem in getting everything to work just right. There's problems sometimes.	Again, this is where Akamai really helps their customers in being able to make sure that OTT, it is delivered reliably, can handle large-scale at high bit rates, which means high quality pictures and at a reasonable price point because as that industry grows they need to see the cost per bit delivered come down. And so that's a place where we've got great strength, and I'm very optimistic about the future growth of our OTT business.	Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)	Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Guggenheim Securities. Your question, please.	Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities	Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions here. Listen, I'd like to maybe do a little bit of follow-on on to the large Internet Platform question. Even this quarter and last quarter, you've been – the revenue numbers have held a lot better than we were anticipating, and I'm wondering as we think about that customer group if it is still sort of overflow that you're receiving in terms of traffic, or if there's been any sort of change in terms of the workloads maybe that they're handing off to you versus the ones that they're keeping on their own do-it-yourself platform. Or maybe even alternatively, we've seen them push into some of the new product offerings that you guys are out there with. That incremental color would be helpful. Thanks.	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. We don't really operate on an overflow basis. So it's whatever you're seeing is not really attributed to that. I don't think there's really been a fundamental change in the Internet platform companies in terms of their utilization quarter-to-quarter. Generally, the trend that we expect to see is they're going to try to do more of the delivery themselves. Obviously, they'll take the easier stuff and work on that first. That's one thing that we've seen in the past. That said this stuff is hard to do and to do well and actually to do affordably. So I think that we will continue to have business with these customers. I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward.	Jonathan Schildkraut - Guggenheim Securities	All right. Understood. Thanks a lot.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your question, please.	Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC	Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So in terms of the increased investment that you're planning on making, I want to understand, I know you don't give guidance beyond the March quarter, but just philosophically, is it a front-end loaded investment in the year where there's more hiring upfront and maybe the non-head count investment happens in the back half? Just how do you layer it in? So do we just step down to the high 30s and then it's a stable EBITDA? Or is there going to be a gradual move down to a trough and then an improvement off the bottom?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	No. I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year. I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter. You won't see it manifest itself significantly because it's going to take a while to get the head count on board and the spending to ramp. So I think you're probably going to begin to see that effective in Q2.	And then my expectation is that, again, it'll stay in the high 30s thereafter. So I think you'll probably – I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range. But I do expect that kind of in Q2 and beyond that it's going to operate in the high 30s.	Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC	Okay. And then my follow-up question is I think you gave us a comment on the top six customers and what you expect in terms of the further decline in the March quarter. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Does that leave the rest of the customers actually need to accelerate in terms of growth? And if that's the case, where's the source of that acceleration going to come from? Is it the Security side or the Performance or Media side and why?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. Well, part of that is, again, when you talk about acceleration, you're talking about year-on-year. So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago. My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen.	And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business.	Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC	So basically at the midpoint of the range outside the top six you're expecting the same performance in March as you just saw in December?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, roughly, yes.	Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC	Okay. Thank you.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Isbell (01:02:22) from Pacific Crest Securities. Your question, please.	Unknown Speaker	Hey, guys. Tom, just a quick question. Hey, can you guys talk a little bit about your relationship with Microsoft? And if you're seeing any sort of adoption from public cloud users purchasing your product on their platform?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. You can click to buy Akamai Whole Site Delivery on Azure. A lot of companies have done that. It's not a material amount of revenue to us. The Microsoft relationship, on the other hand, is very important to us. We have a substantial number of customers and revenue that flow through Microsoft. And of course, they're a large customer themselves.	Unknown Speaker	Great. And then it sounds like you guys are seeing a little bit more success maybe on the outbound sales side, particularly with Security. What do you need to do to sort of turn that equation around to get more of a pull in effect? I know you guys are stepping up your sales force to go after that growth, but if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be great.	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah, we have a new CMO, Monique Bonner, and really making substantial progress in our digital marketing effort, and I think that'll help quite a bit in terms of generating more efficient inbound sales.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. Great. Thanks.	Operator	Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.	Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.	Hey, good afternoon. Just to clarify, when you talked about getting back to double-digit revenue, were you suggesting that happens in 2017 or beyond 2017, or you weren't saying any timeframe at all?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe. I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth. This is actually the first year we have not. I think you know that certainly the driver of that has been what's been going on with these large Internet Platform Customers. The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens.	So we have been growing in the double-digits. I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company.	Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.	Okay. Thanks. And then for international, it's been growing, but it still remains around 30% of revenue. Is part of the investment in 2017 focused at all on initiatives that maybe over-indexed internationally? It seems like that could be a huge opportunity. Is product set or getting the right sales team in place the key factors to drive international to a higher percent of revenue?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank. Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market. I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation – we will make some investments there. It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell.	Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue. And we've proven we can do that, Security being the most recent example.	Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question.	Operator	Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig-Hallum. Your question, please.	Unknown Speaker	Yeah, hey. Good evening, guys. This is Ryan (01:06:13) sitting in for Jeff. Just for Ion, I know at the last Analyst Day you mentioned 53% penetration with the product in your customer base. Any update you can provide on base penetration? Or where you see the penetration peeking out? And the price uplift you're seeing from that?	James Benson - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Yeah. I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of – it starts with customers that really, really care about performance. And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion – many of them are already buying their products.	While there's more to sell there, I'd say that probably not a significant, significant opportunity there. And, yeah, we have seen when customers upgrade to Ion that there is an ARPU uplift at times, but I also think there's other things to sell for our Web Performance Solutions. As Tom mentioned, Image Manager is another offering to sell into the installed base.	So if they're buying Ion, now they can buy Image Manager. If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager. And I think you're going to see us have other adjacencies like that within Web Performance as well.	Unknown Speaker	Great. Thanks. And then back to the top six customers of platform customers, is there any change you guys are seeing in terms of your share of the traffic that you're delivering relative to what the platform company may be doing themselves for using a multi-CDN strategy for?	Frank Thomson Leighton - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	With the top six, we have obviously lost share to the do-it-yourself effort. We're not seeing lost share to other third-party CDNs. It's an issue with the DIY, which is the big company has their own platform and they want to try and do more of it themselves.	Unknown Speaker	Okay. Thanks.	Tom Barth - Akamai Technologies, Inc.	Okay. Thank you, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us for today. And in closing, as Jim mentioned, in addition to our 2017 Investor Summit on March 14, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences in February and March and details of these can be found on the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.	Thank you all for joining us, and have a wonderful evening.	Operator	Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

37,Telecom Italia SpA (NYSE:TI),RIO,Q4 2016 Earnings Call,"February 06, 2017 8:00 am ET","Executives	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Giuseppe Recchi - Telecom Italia SpA	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Stefano de Angelis - Telecom Italia SpA	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Analysts	Dhananjay Mirchandani - Sanford C.

James Edmund Ratzer - New Street Research LLP	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Carola Bardelli - Deutsche Bank SpA	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Bolis speaking, Head of TI Investor Relations. I welcome you to Telecom Italia's Presentation of Preliminary Full Year 2016 Results and of its new plan for 2017-2019. The call would be introduced by our Chairman, Giuseppe Recchi and will be then conducted by our Group Chief Executive Officer, Flavio Cattaneo, by TIM Brasil CEO Stefano De Angelis; and by our Group CFO, Piergiorgio Peluso. At this end of these sessions, we'll be taking questions.	I wish to remind you of our Safe Harbor disclaimer and hand it over now to Giuseppe.	Giuseppe Recchi - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Alex, and welcome to all of you. In the last year, we achieved very important result for our group. There is a common factor across all of them that we'd like mention, which is transformation.	First of all, I would like to underline that since the current board of directors was appointed, it has strongly focused on improving the execution of the business plan and on pushing the management to reach the target set in the budget, but I recall precisely, the moment during the presentation of Telecom Italia Strategic Plan in London, when one of you attending the meeting made a comment that since the last nine years you have been following Telecom Italia Group, the story telling about the strategic plan was to be negative on the first year, reaching flat on the second year to finally turning to positive growth by the third year.	A nice plan, I would say, just having the problem that every year it look always like the first year. This had to change. Now just because any plan without execution is just a wish list, but because our reputation as managers is based on delivering what we promise to shareholders. With the arrival of Flavio, we set new ambitius targets including a three-year domestic efficiency plan of €1.6 billion; a BRL 1.5 billion one for Brazil and a growing domestic EBITDA already for year one after many years of negative performance.	During the first road show, I thought there was some skepticans. We're talking of a very significant efficiency plan, while planning to improve our quality of service in our top-line with the support of new services and an increase of the pace of ultra broadband coverage, both in Italy and in Brazil.	Quarter-after-quarter we delivered and we created value for our shareholders, and in a year that proved to be not easy, we reached nine months, the targets set by the previous plan for year three. And this, please allow me to say, proving wrong also several opinions in our own country and the fruits of our work would be showing more and more.	The upgrade to ultra broadband of our networks has never been faster. In Italy today, our fiber coverage reach is 60% of the country, which means about 14.5 million households. We have implemented one of the fastest growing coverage rate in all Europe. 4G coverage stands at more than 96%. In Brazil, 4G urban coverage of year 2016 has moved up to 74%, reaching 1,255 cities.	All of TI is under transformation. It's not only a matter of revenues, cost and networks. It is also about creating a new corporate identity and culture based on straightforward response to our customer needs and serving them better than any other player in our countries of references. We're also spreading through our company the sense of urgency which is necessary to build a solid reliability along with a new legacy of pride across all management and employees, for the several goals still in front of us.	With that same clarity and conviction that led us to radically change course 10 months ago, today, I want to convey the message that we're entirely confident that the developments we have set in motion over the last 10 months are the right action to start to completely address and overcome the next challenges. And we can say so, as our vision is strongly supported by the last three quarter results.	Let me now turn the floor to Flavio, that will take you through the main results of 2016 and will give you an outline of the new plan.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Giuseppe, and hello to everyone. Indeed after the first quarter of 2016, a strong transformation started in TI. The company has developed new strengths, reflected in the solid improvement of its main result. This turnaround in our operating and financial profile is allowing us to face external challenges.	This is how we have reacted. We are ready to respond to Iliad's entry, counterattacking with second brand strategy on the cost conscious segment, while TIM is accelerating on convergence and quality. We have preempted and strongly limited future well say competition for an Enel Open Fiber by increasing our FTTC coverage target to 80% in 2017 and to 95% by the end of the plan. Extending our FTTH, will allow plans to 50 cities, equivalent to more than 20% of the Italian household.	Our new full equivalent model has been received positively by both, the antitrust and the regulators improving inter-operator environment and reducing mitigation risks. Open Access and wholesale have already completed the transformation of 40 out of 75 key processes.	Our transformation goes very deep, as it involve the corporate culture, the mindset, the processes, the quality and the attitude of the whole group. We delivered strong results in the last three quarters in choppy waters, while political turbulence, sector performance and our €1.2 billion mandatory conversion impacted our stock, but this didn't distract us from our work. We have people who sail with any sea and always bring the ship into harbor. So today we can introduce more ambitious goals that in the next three years will take us to totally turn around TI.	For this, we aren't waiting for any external help, but are banking on our internal resources and our growing capacity to deliver. We have called this plan a transforming company to represent our vision of the need to create a long-lasting and forward looking growth. We are upgrading our NGAN-wide driving and we will drive faster with the team fit to win new challenges and grasp new opportunities. We are combining the strength and size of a large incumbent with a new and unique industrial region and an attacking attitude that introduce changes to the usual telco scenario. Racing and competing is never easy. Some support you while others oppose you, but determination drives achievement and this is the case for the people of TI.	Now before telling you about our many new plan action, let's start the way we are used to, a review of what we have already done. The combined turnaround in our Italian and Brazilian operation is working. On slide five, you can see how our new course of action has taken Q4 group revenues performance into positive territory to plus 0.8% year-on-year.	Group EBITDA is now into its third consecutive positive quarterly performance. On a full year basis, it stand at plus 2.4%. Total turnaround from the minus 7.5% year-on-year recorded in the first quarter. Net cash flow enjoys a quite substantial €1.6 billion contribution in the Q4 2016 and rises by about €2.2 billion in the full year. Net of the mandatory conversion effect, these results shows year-on-year increase of about €1.5 billion. Net debt has been substantially reduced to €25.1 billion.	Our financial position is managed in a very sound way. 71% of our gross debt is fixed defending our interest cost over time. Average debt maturity is eight years and our current liquidity position is €12.5 billion, covering our financing risk until 2020. This protect us against any turbulence in the capital market. As you can see, our strive for operation and the financial improvement is very clear.	On slide six, we break down group main result into domestic and Brazil. Total domestic revenues reversed the trend moving from minus 2.3% in the Q1 to plus 2.7% in Q4. They have stabilized on a full year basis, which supported this change with the new offers delivering, for instance, on off-peak mobile network usage and adjacent market enabling product like TVs to locate and up-sell. In the meantime and in the last three quarters, our domestic NGN coverage increased from 45% to 60% and our 4G went from 92% to 96%.	Only one number to give you the pace. 120,000 of new premises connected with fiber optic. While these results were being secured in the last three quarters, total domestic cash costs were reduced by about €600 million. This is equal to the amount of the total efficiencies that were announced in three-year plan in the last February. On the back of these positive results, we're pleased to highlight that we have beaten our low-single-digit domestic organic EBITDA growth target for last year with a plus 4.5% full year performance.	In Italy in only nine months, EBITDA organic performance was totally reshaped from minus 5.2% at the end of March of 2016 to plus 8.4% in the last quarter showing an improvement of 13.6 percentage point. In Brazil, the EBITDA trend turned positive for the first quarter later than domestic as its efficiency plan was implemented from June 2016. It is now its second consecutive quarter of positive organic performance at the plus 2.8% year-on-year with a very respectable 17.8 percentage point improvement since Q1.	Total revenues on TIM Brasil jumped from minus 15.3% to minus 1.7% from the first quarter to the last quarter improving by 13.6 percentage point. In the same period, our Brazilian urban 4G coverage increased from 60% to 74% and the 3G one from 82% to 89%. It is quite an impressive ride and we'll continue as we are seeing from a positive start of the year.	On slide seven, we review the main feature of our fourth quarter domestic performance. Our mobile service revenue were up 3.1% year-on-year supported by increased data usage coming from growing 4G penetration in our customer base. Our business segment performance which returned positive after many years supported by the end of constant across and by a new operational and commercial drive across all its component, innovative offers we launched in the fall and a balanced response to the discounter, while pushing on quality and convergence on the value segment.	Mobile ARPU grew to €13.3 from €12.8. Net MNP was up plus 26,000 against minus 44,000 on the previous quarter. TIM churn, 22.8%, best-in-class position in Italy.	On fixed, the result of our autumn campaign are visible. Total revenues were up 1.5% year-on-year against minus 3.9% of the same quarter of 2015, supported, as already mentioned, by an improving underlying service trend and the sale of (00:16:19) enabling equipment such as smart TVs.	Quarterly fixed line losses improved to minus 83,000, down from minus 100,000 on the previous quarter and better by 41% from the 140,000 at the end of March. Fiber net adds scored plus 125,000, up from last quarter 82,000, confirming continuing year-on-year growth. We have now over 1 million fiber retail customers after having scored a growth of 459,000 lines during last year. Including VULA and other order or say fiber, our total fiber lines are now about 1.4 million. Fixed broadband ARPU of €22.3 showed a 5.5 percentage point growth year-on-year. Fixed service revenue trend was impacted by recent wholesale price review. Nevertheless, it remained in line with the last quarter year-on-year performance of minus 3.6%.	After this review of 2015, let's now move to slide eight, we start the plan section. TIM is transforming itself from the inside, combining its leading position with a new agile and lean approach. Our new plan aims at a deep discontinuity with the past and a full turnaround with clear accountability and metrics. It implement TIMvision through a total quality approach to fully exploit the business opportunities in the coming years and to properly address risk leveraging on best infrastructures, access and transport data centers, IT and cloud. A strong and sound commercial approach, focusing on superior service, offer innovation, expansion and convergence, content and play, while upselling and locating customers, efficiency to deliver superior customer experience and reduce total cost of ownership. Re-launch of our subsidiaries, TIM Brasil as well in its progress, there are opportunities also for INWIT, Sparkle, and even Olivetti. Revenues and EBITDA rebound will drive solid cash flow generation, leverage, and value creation.	On slide 9 we move to our infrastructures that represent a double competitive advantage. First, our customer will experience the quality of best technology and available network. Second, it will allow to offer a widespread convergence, to enable content and ICT delivery, creating ability to successfully compete in the long term. To achieve this, first of all, we will expand our Ultrabroadband coverage in all of Italy based on the future-proof market technology, convergence, combining in the most effective and efficient way, NGN, wireless platform, LTE and FWA and data centers.	Ultra-band coverage will be driven by commercial appeal and profitability. In main cities and industrial districts, where demand and needs are strongest, we will go for FTTH and FTTB. In wider Italy, we'll deploy superfast eVDSL, made possible by the status of our fixed network moving from current 200 megabits taken to 300 megabits, and it will follow further evolution and include selected C and D areas. Our ambition is get there before the others.	LTE will be always more enhanced and will be deployed everywhere to ensure an always on evolution and to complete our reach. Strong synergies will be pursued with INWIT, which is fully on track, funding enlargement of its network, adding sites, more cell, and the calling connection. And we shall further expand on our Ultrabroadband coverage with fixed wireless access offering to our customer unsurpassed quality in main additional locations. Our new target anticipate and go beyond previous plan. We'll complete the deployment of our innovative network by 2019, reaching a coverage of 95% in NGN and over 99% in LTE. This development will determine an increase of innovative CapEx in the next years, rising from around 13% at the start of 2015 to above 50% in 2019.	Let's now move to slide 10. Our customer base is our major asset, a sound commercial approach is crucial to preserve and expand it. TIM will implement an attack attitude to support and enhance its premium commercial proposition and to defend market share. We have done away with incumbent and now to a looser mode switching from defense to offence. A second brand we have protecting premium position. At the same time, it will exploit opportunities in the low-end segment.	TIM commercial approach will focus on the business basics, customers' need and quality, with the primary goal to increase the take-up of Ultrabroadband to support and enhance its premium positioning that TIM will leverage on lock-in mechanism to increase customer loyalty and retention, supported also by focused and selective positioning on adjacent markets, from which we have already started to see the benefit. This will allow a further push on bundles and convergence, both for families and enterprises, enlarging addressable market. We are developing a solid video strategy based on the availability of exclusive and premium content supported also by co-production initiatives.	We have just announced a deal on the 2016 full catalog of Rai Cinema, the national broadcasting, securing a three-year the first and the second win of deal give us an exclusivity on 20 premium Italian movies. We are working on other exclusive opportunities to integrate the linear and on-demand content and maximizing freedom on choice.	We'll grow our new tailor-made offer based on the geographical differentiation, specific tariff plans and on a deep customization for large enterprises. Supported by these actions by 2019, we expect NGN active fiber customer to grow by four times and the adoption on our mobile broadband customer base to increase to about 90%.	In 2019, we also plan to reach well more than three times the current 3Play customers, voice, broadband and video, of about 1 million and to lock-in about 45% on fixed consumer customer base, about 35% of mobile CB and more than 1 million business customer. During the plan period, our fixed and retail line losses will be reduced at parity by 2018. In this assumption, we have carefully considered an impact of all possible new entrants.	On slide 11, we take a look at the positive consequences of our network and commercial strategy on domestic top-line and EBITDA performance. The combination of our action and the big changes that we are introducing are indeed transforming our domestic main result over the next three years horizon.	We have also taken a strong view on the role of enabling equipment. Indeed, we sold many smart TVs in one quarter. This device increased our top-line performance and stimulated broadband adoption, and we are working also on modem combined with set-top box, gaming and security devices, connected household appliances, multi-room audio component, and other connected products. They are in growing demand from Italian households, but potential demand is lowered down by price and other financial consideration.	We are intercepting this huge flow with a win-win arbitrage. We transferred our purchasing capacity as incumbent to our retail customer, with enough subsidy – passing on most of the related volume discount. Customer pays us in multiyear installment in the phone bill, while professional counterparties will relieve us of any credit risk in our balance sheet.	Interestingly, this addition markets are showing low-teens growth trend, while the overall dynamics of telecommunication look rather stable. So, we have decided to introduce them in our mainstream business as lock-in and growth factors. Our clients in return accept gladly to be locked into something they really like. This enable us a new stream of service revenues.	On the back of our overall strategy, the market share is going to evolve positively both mobile and on fixed. The result of our domestic operation over the next three years starting from 2017 will be growing total revenues, stable service revenues, low year-on-year single digit EBITDA growth. Efficiency has been a driver of the result we scored in 2016 and will continue to be a key element of our new plan.	Last May we presented an OpEx efficiency plan worth €800 million of our rate reduction. As you will remember, volume driven costs were kept flat. Now, as you can see, we are utilizing some flexibility on COGS, while increasing from €800 million to €900 million of our OpEx efficiency plan net of volume driven, because we plan an increase of volume. All we had to COGS increases total revenues. As we already said, there is no subsidy and no risk in our balance sheet.	The underlying Broadband enabling equipment actually generates additional service revenues, it support our EBITDA performance. Again, this tell you what we mean by efficiency. We aren't cutting costs for the sake of some short-term effect. Instead, we are building over time flexibility for the company to achieve long-term improvements of its business profile and to create value for all stakeholders.	The new business line brings additional cash cost savings and OpEx savings. We have increased our target to €900 million 2015-2019 run rate net of volume driven. Piergiorgio will give you in this section the detail of this composition.	On CapEx, as our Ultrabroadband build out, we'll approach completion in 2019 total investments and will benefit from further efficiency. So adding one more year of disciplined capital allocation to the 2016-2018 plan presented last May, the run rate increased from €800 million to €1 billion. So total new domestic cash cost efficiency and up to a total of €1.9 billion up by €300 million from last May's plan.	Before my conclusion, I will leave it now to Stefano to give you an overview of Brasil, and to Piergiorgio for an update on group financial performance. Please.	Stefano de Angelis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Flavio. In slide 14, and -	[Technical Difficulty] (00:30:38 – 00:30:58)	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, please stay on line. Thank you.	Stefano de Angelis - Telecom Italia SpA	Can we start it again?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Okay. Please continue.	Stefano de Angelis - Telecom Italia SpA	I'll continue. In the long-term perspective, we expect to complete TIM's brand repositioning to reach a perception of high-quality to a reasonable price. In other words, the best value for money player. In this process of repositioning, I would like to convey some important messages.	We will strengthen the postpaid position, while ensuring the leadership in the prepaid segment. Network quality and coverage would be a key competitive differentiator, mainly on 4G. Our offers will add digital services embedded to improve convenience, customer experience and loyalty, and we will improve our convergent portfolio in São Paulo and Rio with TIM Live 3 million households all suburban coverage and partnership with content providers, such as Sky, for pay-TV services.	As presented in the results for 2016 last Friday, network development is one of the central points of the strategy. And here in slide 15, I highlight the level we want to achieve building the faster and wider mobile broadband network in Brazil.	In the 4G, we aim to reach 95% of the European population and exceed the coverage of 3G, which is still an important source for user in the transition of technologies. This leap we are seeing in the 4G is made possible by the rollout of 700 megahertz frequencies, which will be added to the refarming efforts being carried out on the 1.8 gigahertz frequency.	In the slide 16, and looking at the evolution of the mobile market in Brazil, we believe that bundling of voice data in digital services will become more and more relevant, especially for the postpaid customers, which should reach more than 35% of our base by 2019. The prepaid will further consolidate second SIM cards and the up-sell to postpaid controlled plans. In all, we expect that confirming our leadership in prepaid and improving our customer mix with a significant upgrade into the postpaid would bring our revenues growth above market average in the period.	On the other side, our perspective for OpEx is to consolidate the efficiency plan loan launched in the first half of last year.	On slide 17, I call your attention to three important points. The first is the over-execution that allow us to improve our 2018 target reaching BRL 2 billion versus BRL 1.8 billion originally told. The second point is to guarantee a continuous improvement in efficiency and achieve the total of BRL 2.3 billion at the end of 2019.	And lastly, it's important to underline that our total OpEx in 2019 should be around the nominal figures reported in 2015 despite inflationary impacts and a substantial upgrade of our network and customer base.	Finally, we expect that the new plan will substantially improve the profitability and cash generation as demonstrated on slide 18. The investment cycle that was necessary on the transition from 3G to 4G network will reach the final phase at 2019 reaching almost 95% of the urban population. And the CapEx that will sum around BRL 12 billion in the three years' plan will follow the descending trajectory. In the same period, we believe that EBITDA will expand bringing a substantial improvement of the cash generated by the operation.	Last but not least, we present on page 19, a table with our targets for Brazilian operation, not only for the long-term as usual, but this year, we are introducing the short-term expectation which calls for a positive revenues and EBITDA in all quarters for 2017. CapEx near to BRL 4 billion, and EBITDA minus CapEx on revenues moving up to high single digit. All these short-term improvements are expected to continue in the next two years, as we can see on the long-term targets.	Thank you and now I turn the floor to Mr. Piergiorgio, please.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you very much, Stefano. Let me start with the 2016 domestic efficiencies overview, slide 21. We show you our four quarter sequence of domestic efficiencies for 2016. As you know, record performance for second quarter was supported by the non-payment of €67 million employee performance bonus for 2016. Without this element, if we net the volume driven components, OpEx efficiency performance was broadly in line throughout the last three quarters totaling €340 million.	For Q4, I would like to highlight our gain in the market-driven cluster. Commercial levers were not scarified at all while efficiencies were supported by lower sponsorship and rebranding expenses. Slide 22, on the back of our strong operational improvements both in Italy and in Brazil and with the support of our efficiencies, operating free cash flow is sharply pointed upwards for the year.	And on slide 22, we point out to our group level improvement worth about €900 million, up by 45% year-on-year. Its absolute value stands at €2.9 billion for 2016. In combination with the non-operating components, these impressive results translated, as you already know, into a €2.2 billion net debt reduction during the last year.	On slide 23, we update our domestic cost efficiency dashboard for the new plan. I wish to highlight again our volume-driven flexibility will be more than fully compensated by a parallel increase in total revenues with no subsidies or risk in our balance sheet.	As Flavio told you, the use of this flexibility will play a role for the stabilization of the domestic service revenues starting already for 2017. If we exclude the volume driven element from the new plan, OpEx efficiency increased from a 2015-2018 run rate of €800 million to a 2015-2019 run rate of €900 million.	Below, you can see the contributors of this change. On one side, in 2019, level of cost will increase by about €100 million due to the end of our solidarity program. At the same time, process driven cost will be reduced by €200 million, incorporating the effect of two main factors. The job reconversion of about 4,300 employees through our job center that will allow important in-sourcing and provisioning, delivery involved with external manpower contributions of our Open Access division.	Second, increased efficiency in our real estate where many contracts expire in 2019 and we will free up additional space. For your information, the total amount of square meters that will be freed by 2019 is about 3 million. The new plan also creates further €200 million of efficiency in domestic CapEx, bringing them down to €2.9 billion in 2019. This will contribute to the achievement of our less than 20% CapEx saves target at the group level. As you can see in the lower part of slide 23, as we approach completion of our Ultrabroadband coverage target, decommissioning and delayering in our traditional component increase allowing to step-up overall savings.	With slide 24, we now come to our deleverage update which, as you can see, aims to ensure with even more strength and improving investment grade ratio of below 2.7 times at year-end 2018. This ratio would be further reduced in 2019. This target now includes 2017 spectrum renewal cost in Italy, which will get totally offset by year-end 2018. This will leave us with a net free cash flow generation in 2017 and 2018 of about €700 million per year, without the contribution of any disposal. No dividend payment on ordinary is considered in our new plan scenario. At the same time, statutory minimum payment on salary is confirmed.	With this, I hand back you to Flavio.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Stefano and Piergiorgio, for your presentation. We have summarized the main element of what is truly making TI a transforming company. The turnaround we have already delivered in the last three quarters will indeed enable further material upside to our main operating and financial metrics in new plan timeframe.	On slide 26, you'll find our full year guidance for Italy and TI group, which is added to the one that has been already given from Brazil. Italy, first of all, we are turning the corner on domestic revenues and EBITDA by announcing for the next three years total revenues growth, service revenue stability and year-on-year EBITDA low-single-digit growth.	Second, we'll cover all of Italy with our Ultrabroadband coverage by increasing all yearly target both in NGAN and LTE, reaching respectively around 95% and 99% coverage by the end of 2019. We are confirming our target of 5 billion of NGAN customers by year-end 2018, further accelerating the growth after that. We'll stabilize line losses by 2018. We have identified further €300 million domestic cash cost efficiencies, taking the new 2015-2019 run rate to €1.9 billion.	We'd be doing more for the same on domestic investment. Cumulated 2017-2019 figures stand now at about €11 billion, including the frequencies renewables and not included in the past. Autonomous roll out of our all Ultrabroadband in selected C and D areas that is included in our CapEx.	Group, we'll reduce our CapEx sales ratio to below 20% by 2019. And finally we are improving our year-end 2018 leverage target of less than 2.7 times net debt-to-EBITDA by including Italian 2017 spectrum renewable and without the need of any disposal. Further debt reduction will follow. The outcome will be different. TI, we're a different TI, lean, flexible and always on top of every challenge delivering to our investors the value they deserve.	Thank you all very much for your attention. And we are ready to take your questions.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Q&A session is open now. And may I ask each participant to keep it only to one point, so that we can open the discussion as much as possible please. We can start now.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session is now open. First question comes from Mr. Mirchandani Dhananjay from Bernstein.	Dhananjay Mirchandani - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.	Yes. Thank you very much for fielding my question. Iliad and Enel's market entry announcements in the first half of 2016 have undeniably impacted the valuation of the domestic business. Now, arguably you have very little control over what both actors will end up doing. Now considering the radical improvements in your domestic structural costs, how much additional flexibility did you have in your cost base to mitigate any unforeseen revenue impact from both players' actions? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Obviously, when we have said in our presentation, we have considered the new entrants that means that we have considered also this element that we have the flexibility to for respond in a market way in both areas. For what concern the infrastructures, that means a strong acceleration in coverage, also in C and D areas. And for Iliad, we have already started with a second brand. We have already started with the test and we have taken into consideration also this discounter new entrant.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you very much, Dhananjay.	Dhananjay Mirchandani - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.	Can I just very briefly follow up, if I may Alex?	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Of course, go ahead.	Dhananjay Mirchandani - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.	Yeah. So I understand the measures that you're putting into place to defend the revenue side. I guess my question was more focused on the cost side of the equation. And how much incremental flexibility you have on the cost side, if the impact is unforeseen on the revenue side?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Yes, but if I sign this amount, because we think that this flexibility we need to, no, for combat these new entrants for this reason. What we have announced is sure we're rich. The other money we need for combat this situation.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	So, if you wish, the answer, Dhananjay, is that this flexibility has been budgeted for.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	We have but it's not disclosed yet. It's not disclosed.	Dhananjay Mirchandani - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.	Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Dhananjay. Next question please?	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Stéphane Beyazian from Raymond James. Mr. Beyazian, please.	Stéphane Beyazian - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.	Thank you. A quick question please on the business market. There was a marked improvement, especially, in the wireless business market. Can you put a bit more color there between the sort of regulatory impact of the Consip and potentially any exceptionals there from potentially equipment sale? I guess what I'm trying to understand here is how sustainable return to growth, especially in business wireless is going forward? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	As we have said in the presentation, we have not only increased the revenues coming from the mobile service revenues, but we have increased also the ARPU. Essentially coming from the data usage for the growing 4G coverage penetration, also for what concern the business segment, we have introduced a new commercial action, the innovative offers, a balanced responsive discount. And also let me say we have not yet taken into consideration also the VoIP that which has grown of the fixed line into the line and no included in our number. But I think and we've already announced many time, probably with the next quarter, we'll announce also the line in VoIP because for what concern the business area, are essentially in the middle between fixed and mobile. You use the mobile but in charge of the fixed lines.	Stéphane Beyazian - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.	Any change in the competitive environment in the business market that also helped?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	In term of price not particularly. Actually I think there is a little bit increase of the value of the market. Regarding the consumer is more or less stable. But we've seen also in a stable market we have increased our ARPU, because for many effect also for the devices and the other effect linked to the lock-in.	Stéphane Beyazian - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.	Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah. They whole environment is kind of cooling off. So we don't envisage in the short term any particularly strong competitive environment on the business segment. Next question, please?	Operator	Next question comes from Julio Arciniegas from RBC. Mr. Arciniegas, please.	Julio Arciniegas - RBC Europe Ltd.	Thank you very much for taking the question. And first of all, I wanted to congratulate for the set of results. So my question is regarding the fiber deployments. In the presentation, basically you're targeting 95% of coverage on fixed, right and doing selective investments in the some C and D. Can you give me some color of the economics on fiber in some C and D? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	At this stage, I can't disclose completely because the first auction is not yet – there is not the conclusion of the first auction. According to the Italian law, all the participants can't discuss about it, but we have already announced to the government our intention for we're concerned the next auction to realize ourselves the coverage in FTTC and in FWA. It's clear our intention, I think that we need to use our grid with maybe the grid of the other. We realize our technology in FTTC. We believe we think even because the fact showing that the technology improve the speed, there is less noise – noisy for the customers, and we can offer an acceptable and very good quality for our customers before the others and that allow us to retain all of our customers. And also on wholesale who will be the first mover will take the majority part of the customers.	All of this scenario is included in our figures. This plan included the coverage. For this, I said – believe me, this amount of CapEx is very good because including also the investment in this area, not only the spectrum.	Julio Arciniegas - RBC Europe Ltd.	Yeah, may I follow up quite fast on that? So basically, you're assuming that you're going to do some part of the investments coverage with some funding from the government, right?	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	No. I think the point was precisely the opposite that we are preparing to cover, as Mr. Cattaneo said, selective parts of the C and D area, using our own grid, not depending on other people.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Yes, absolutely. The other grid is the startle, is a state-owned grid, for what concern the area C and D. We have already our grid in copper. We upgrade our grid in FTTC and we cover in fiber, our customers. It is the normal like the other part of the Italian areas where there is not convenience we use even because we can reach immediately in this case because we participate also the renewal for the spectrum for FWA directly with LTE and the wireless instead of wireline. And today, also in this way the technology allow to reach important speed acceptable, for sure, if you compare the speed of the ADSL in this rural area.	Julio Arciniegas - RBC Europe Ltd.	Okay.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	So, it's a multi-technology coverage Mr. Cattaneo is talking about. Next question, please.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Matteo Bertelè of Fidentiis. Mr. Bertelè, please.	Matteo Bertelè - Fidentiis	Yes, good morning, everybody. I have a question regarding with the strategy. If I understand well, actually given that your service in revenues in the domestic market are going to be flat in the period, and your total revenues are increasing by €0.5 million, which is also reflected in your OpEx, all the growth will come from, let's say home appliances, other devices that you are let's say purchasing using your purchasing leverage with a big volume and passing this kind of discount to the final customer. So in this way the customer will have a lock-in period of, I don't know, 48 months because it took the television with you. Let's say, what is my question is how we should treat this strategy? The sort of consumer lending, how does it work if the customer will not, let's say spend with you for 48 month for this kind of, let's say problem on this kind of lock-in period?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	First of all, let me say, as I showed the result, the equipment is a driver for increase the service revenues and not because TI intent for activity is like a store for the white goods and so on. But we need for a lock in for increase the usage – the usage essentially of data. Indeed, in the last quarter, this show to the market because presently, there is a connection between the equipment and the increase of especially the mobile in some case. And we started on in this period, also with the content our expectation will be the increase in penetration of fiber during the year. And in my opinion that is important because without this enabling devices of equipment, the growth will be not the same. This is our vision and I think the fact show that is right this vision.	The second element, the customers sign a contract, the risk is off balance sheet because they pay installment to our monthly payment of our bill. But there is no risk from TI, because the finances is coverage by the external bank. And in this case, there is also an amount as a penalty in case they renounce they continued stay. This lock-in, we use also for the other element like, mobile phone, and so on. And the return, it has been not only acceptable but very good and not only in Italy. We intend to give to the customer, not only our customers, in general, to the market, the reason to stay or to start to stay with us. And this reason is not only the line or the value of the monthly payment, but it could be also other reason. One of them, content, equipments, smart home, gaming all the element at the edge of market that allow us to reach, improve our number of customers.	Matteo Bertelè - Fidentiis	Okay. Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Let's now move on to the next question, please.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Jerry Dellis from Jefferies. Mr. Dellis, please.	Jerry Dellis - Jefferies International Ltd.	Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. With your fiber targets you're targeting FTTP across our 30 main cities by the end of 2017 and 50 main cities by the end of 2019. Could you tell us, please, how many households those equate to?	And then when you talk about the upgrade in VDSL to deliver 200 to 300 megabits per second, could you also indicate, please, how many households that upgrade would cover by the end of 2019? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	About 4 million households are foreseen in the plan for FTTH in Italy. Essentially, in the part of the city where the demand is strongly for the dimension in terms of not only in download, but also in upload, the center of the city where there is office, business center, this is the main area where we intend core with the FTTH. For the residential use, we think that we have the return of our customer. The speed is sufficient, not only 300 megabits per second, but we are already in very up stage, but also 100 megabits per second or 200 megabits per second. And for the residential consumer, I don't believe the FTTH is the right solution if you compare the investment, the noise for the clients and so on. Even because when a customer have already a fiber, don't need the upgrade because this speed cover all the needs.	Jerry Dellis - Jefferies International Ltd.	Thank you. So just to confirm, the 50 cities equates to 4 million households?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	50.	Jerry Dellis - Jefferies International Ltd.	Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	You're welcome.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Next question, please.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Stefano Lustig from Equita. Mr. Lustig, please.	Stefano Lustig - Equita SIM SpA	Yeah. Good afternoon. And first of all congratulations for the result. And I look and I think the slide number 30, that in terms of multimedia you are anticipating the negotiations ongoing on Sport. I wonder if you want to share with us not exactly the kind of negotiation but at least the philosophy you have in looking forward to this kind of content. And more in general for multimedia, if you can tell us the reasons for the demerger of TIMvision? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	For what concern the content, our intension is realize TIMvision or create a new quality of TIMvision with premium content in exclusivity, blockbusters and Italian product, very attractive stars and name because this support not only the penetration of TIMvision obviously, but TIMvision – it is a driver. It is a key for attract new customers. Obviously, in this way, there is also the sport and we are different negotiation but I can't disclose at this stage, but our strategy is clear.	Content is an important part even though we don't pay an incredible price. I know, I think, well, this sector and there's also (01:04:34) show our ability to a dealmaker in this sector that we have paid, I think, a very unexpensive price for 20 important premium Italian movies. This is more important. The rationale for the merger – it is because in some case for reach not only the result on quality but also the result in terms of investment is better to enter also in production or co-production as a team – was according to the Italian law even because there is some financing, wasn't impossible. For this reason, we have created a company, even because we have an agile and very lean subject for redesign all these offer of TIMvision. Not only the question how many title do you have, but which title you have in your basket – in your bouquet. In this case, we need to improve, but we have already started.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, Stefano.	Stefano Lustig - Equita SIM SpA	Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Move on to the next one.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Singh Mandeep from Redburn. Mr. Mandeep, please.	Mandeep Singh - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Thank you for taking the question. It's really relating to your cash flow and leverage outlook. And the sort of two moving parts I'd like to understand a bit more. So it is a sort of two-part question. One is on the CapEx. You say €11 billion. You've given us the 2018 and 2019 number. Obviously, that implies a very big number in 2017 even if you adjust for the spectrum. So, is the €11 billion like an approximate number or you're leaving yourself a little bit of headroom because it looks like it could be about €4.4 billion in 2017? That's the first part of the question. The second part of the question is really on the interest charge. I mean, you've got a lot of gross cash. Your interest charge is still quite high. Can you give us any sort of outlook for how you expect your interest cost to develop over the next few years? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Piergiorgio will take your question, Mandeep.	Mandeep Singh - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Thank you.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah hi. So, first question on the CapEx, on the €11 billion of CapEx in the domestic. So these are, of course, only limited to domestic. If we include also the Brazil, our cumulated amount is in the region of €13.5 billion. This is what we are targeting at the group level. In terms of the €11 billion, we include everything in this amount. We include also the investment that Mr. Cattaneo was referring to mainly in the previous answer of the direct investment in the C&D areas and so-called in infratel area and it includes also the spectrum.	On the interest charge, this year we've not given, let's say, the reconciliation between operational free cash flow and the net financial positions. Let me maybe comment also at this point, maybe could be useful. We are showing a €2.9 billion operating free cash flow. From this, of course, you have to deduct €2 billion of M&A and mandatory convertible which is as you know mandatory convertible in the sale of Argentina. And we have a bulk of valued items of €2.3 billion of financial charges, taxes, foreign exchange and other amount arriving to a net cash flow before dividends of €2.6 billon. Then dividend for €0.2 billion of the (01:08:59), on the savings plus €200 million of year 2017 impact on domestic real estate projects in Brazil and you arrive to a net cash flow of €2.2 billion.	On financial charges, you arrive in the usual amount in the region of €1.5 billion of the cash interest charges which is the sum of the interest charges net of the profit on the liquidity. And this year you will have also a positive effect of the mandatory convertible, which is slightly lower than €500 million, which means that this year we will have an accounting financial charges below €1 billion. But this is as I said there is a cash component of €1.5 billion and a non-cash component of slightly lower than €0.5 billion.	Mandeep Singh - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Can I just please follow-up on the CapEx?	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah.	Mandeep Singh - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Okay. So just so I'm very clear. Your three-year cumulative is at €11 billion. If I deduct the specific guidance you've given for 2018 and 2019 that leaves €5 billion in 2017. If you assume €600 million for spectrum renewal, then – just to make it clear, are you looking to spend about €4.4 billion domestically in 2017?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	So, as you know, we are not giving the number of the total amount, because we don't want to disclose the amount of spectrum. But I will say that the overall area of what you are targeting is correct.	Mandeep Singh - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.	Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Next question?	Operator	The next question comes from Mr. Saeed Baradar (01:10:54) from Louis Capital Market. Mr. Baradar (01:10:58), please.	Unknown Speaker	Thank you very much. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and first of all congratulation on turning quarterly execution into a clear longer-term positive trend here. My question goes back to content. We all agree that content is critical to incremental revenue growth and obviously customer retention. Within that context, would you say that the spinning out of TIMvision actually allows TIMvision to act in both local and cross-border content consolidation? Is this the vision and are you looking at potentially your largest shareholder providing you with further content? And within the local market, isn't Mediaset Premium potentially a good fit in terms of getting some sport products behind your entertainment content? And any more color – I know you just mentioned a few questions ago on some part of it, but any more color on the content, because I do think this is a big area now and it will be very much appreciated.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you. Essentially the content even though – I don't talk about only the Italian content, also the international content. You take into the consideration that we – in case, we are co-producer, we are for the entire life, the owner or a part of the owner of the rights. In case, we have the pre-buy of the rights, we have for certain amount of the year, but it is important to point out that we buy only for the video – the IPTV, also the fiber using. And in this case there is a possibility to divide or sharing with other broadcasting company in terms of buying or realization, the content.	Obviously, the fact regarding TI would be limited in comparison with the other because the value for our sector is very, very different. You take into consideration also that the penetration in Italy of Pay TV is one-off, the less in Europe. And this is another important element because we intend offering bundled content. And the bundle is very attractive for the customers because we give to them a possibility to have many things at the same price. If they buy in with the different company mobile, fixed, fiber and IPTV or sports and so on, they pay more than the bundle offer. For this reason, we cover this sector. Regarding the cross-border, we can participate in co-production also internationally but only for what concerning our part of utilizing for our country, where we are substantially.	Unknown Speaker	Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you for your question.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Welcome.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Next one please.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. James Ratzer from New Street Research. Mr. Ratzer, please.	James Edmund Ratzer - New Street Research LLP	Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Had a question specifically around your line loss target, which I'm encouraging you essentially get back to parity during 2018. Would like to get some kind of thoughts behind the drive as you are seeing on that at moment. I mean the line losses you're seeing today, is this because you are seeing customers going to mobile only or is this because you are losing lines as they go to other broadband competitors? I mean so then what gives you confidence about getting back to stability by 2018? Thank you.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	There is many element to support the reduction on line losses. One of them is the reorganization of the process, because, as you know, we have internally, let me say, a gap between the acquisition and deactivation. There are many factors. There are many factors. We have already started the reorganization. We think when we have reached this more efficient organization, we reduce this gap. This is the bottom, because with the same number we increase the customers.	Secondly, the convergence, convergence support fixed line, because fiber, the content let us the opportunity to reach a new customer, because in comparison with the past, where the fixed line was using only for the voice and the ADSL was not in line with the evolution of the mobile speed. The fiber instead allowed the customer using the Wi-Fi or the content or the other things and support the increase of acquisitions. This is another important element.	Another important element that support, it is the bundle offer. In this case, the difference is between what they pay, for example, with pay-TV, with satellite, the other element, and the mobile without the only-voice fixed line today is completely covered with bundle offer that at the less price offer the same thing. There is an attraction.	The question is, reach as soon as possible the quality of the other competitors or the acceptable quality. And in this case, there is part of the market or today with other operator or to new customer, new market, an enlargement of the market of the fixed line, because it's completely different from the previous one where it was only voice-only.	James Edmund Ratzer - New Street Research LLP	So, I mean, last year you lost about 450,000 lines. I mean, do you know how many of those were lost to your competitors and how many of those went mobile-only?	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Sorry, I didn't understand the question. Please, can you repeat? Because there was noise.	James Edmund Ratzer - New Street Research LLP	Okay. Sorry. So last year you lost about 450,000 lines. I was trying to get an idea of how many of those you felt were homes that went mobile-only, and how many of those were voice lines that actually took up a broadband package with your competitor instead.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	20% from the competitors. The remaining was market.	James Edmund Ratzer - New Street Research LLP	Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you, James. We can move on to the next one.	Operator	Next question comes from Mr. Will Milner from Arete Research. Mr. Milner, please.	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Thank you for taking the question. I had a couple of questions on some of the smaller domestic revenue line items that have improved a lot over the last few quarters. Firstly in the fixed business, it looks like other revenue in the sort of fixed traditional business, data revenue line was – you booked €117 million of revenue this quarter, and the year ago that was only €40 million. So I'm just interested in terms of what has driven that big increase and whether that's something you can hold on to going forward.	And then in the mobile business, clearly the mobile wholesale revenues are over €100 million now, is up I think 36% year-over-year. And so, again, I just want – I suspect some of this is the fast with MVNO, but I just wanted to understand is that sustainable at this level or is it going to increase further going forward as some of that business is transferred over. Thanks.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	I think this one to Piergiorgio, and this will be final question.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Sure. I was looking at the Excel file just to understand if I understood [Technical Difficulty] (1:20:16). Sorry, I was really taking the Excel file in order to check if I understood correctly your question. So you are looking in revenues innovative service broadband for €471 million, this is the amount you were looking at in the total revenues. I don't understand your...	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Sorry, I...	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	The data revenues are related to – particularly there is an important component related to the – revenues are related to modem, a router that we are selling in the business division, and this is highly correlated also to the increase of revenues in the ICT. So I'm just wondering if you're referring to that number.	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	I was referring in the Excel spreadsheet to the section where you list out fixed revenues, traditional services, and you say which business, data and others, and then there is below that another others line, where the revenue is €117 million.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah, exactly. Sorry, sorry, I – from €83 million to €124 million.	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Yes. It's part of that €124 million...	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah, exactly. This is about exactly referring to this condition. These are all revenues related to modem, routers sold in the business division. There are no wholesale revenues from Fastweb and anything else. This is just pure asset revenues related to what we do in the business division.	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Okay. So zero margin modems, routers, okay.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	No, I'm not saying zero margin because of -	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Why zero? There is a margin.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	So you have to consider and to lean closer to the ICT revenues that you have in innovative service, because these are, of course, binding in contract. Of course, there is a limited margin on the asset, but you have to look at all the other contract. And you see that consistently with this increase, we have also increase in ICT service of €149 million to €172 million. So it is not all right to say zero margin. These, of course, very much related to the migration to new technologies.	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	Understood. Thank you.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Sorry, which was the other one? Maybe if you want, we can do offline. Which was the other one?	Will Milner - Arete Research Services LLP	It was on the mobile wholesale revenues.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Yeah, the mobile wholesale revenues, also in this case these are wholesale services, so we have here the visitors, and the consulting and hiring services for INWIT. So this explains the increase that we are having. So, also last quarter we were having from €72 million to €96 million, and from €96 million to €106 million. These are all related, as I said, very much with visitors and INWIT consulting and housing.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	All right. If this is fine, I will move on to the last question please.	Operator	The last question comes from Ms. Carola Bardelli from Deutsche Bank. Ms. Bardelli, please?	Carola Bardelli - Deutsche Bank SpA	Yes, good afternoon. Just a clarification on slide number 12, because if I look at this chart on the right on CapEx, basically what we imply is that the underlying CapEx to sales is below 25% in 2017. So, I would derive is something that would be below the €3.8 billion. So if I sum up these, I get something that is below €10 billion, something maybe in the region of €9.7 billion, €9.8 billion.	So the question is, you spoke about flexibility for spectrum, but should we assume that the spectrum expenditure could be above €1 billion or is it that you are keeping probably more flexibility in the plan compared to what you currently are budgeting?	And my question also relates to the other slide on page 24 where basically you are suggesting that the 2017-2018 free cash flow would be €700 million per year, including spectrum. So if we add up the €600 million – something that we thought would be around €600 million, we are getting to approximately €2 billion. So if the spectrum is to be even more, that means that the underlying free cash flow would be even more. So any further clarification on that point would be really helpful. Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Yes.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Carola, on the €700 million, this is an yearly number and includes the spectrum and, of course, this is an average of only three years. In terms of the CapEx for spectrum, as I said in previous answer, we don't disclose the number, but we have in our number – in our plan a figure before – well below the €1 billion that you were referring to. I don't know exactly the consensus for this amount. I mean, if I remember quite by heart, the number that we in the plan is not so different from what we have in the consensus.	Carola Bardelli - Deutsche Bank SpA	Okay.	Piergiorgio Peluso - Telecom Italia SpA	Then if you want, we can discuss offline, but as I said this is the straight answer.	Carola Bardelli - Deutsche Bank SpA	Okay, very clear. Thank you.	Alex Pierre Bolis - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you Carola and thank you everybody for participating and have a good rest of the day.	Flavio Cattaneo - Telecom Italia SpA	Thank you. Goodbye.	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is over. Thank you for calling Telecom Italia.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].	I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.	Kathleen Quirk	Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and presentation material for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.	Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our Web site homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.	Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.	On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer. Red Conger's here, Mike Hendrix's here, as well as others from our management team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who'll go through the slide materials located on our Web site. As usual after our prepared remarks we'll open up the call for Q&A.	Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $292 million, $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. As detailed in the press release the fourth quarter net income included net charges of 59 million or $0.04 a share reflecting estimated losses on assets held for sale and oil and gas restructuring related charges partly offset by gain on a redeemable non-controlling interest in plains offshore. After adjusting for net charges fourth quarter adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled 351 million or $0.25 per share.	Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter totaled 1.7 billion. As you'll see in the press release FCX took aggressive actions during 2016 to restore its balance sheet strength and we had an active fourth quarter. We completed $5.2 billion in asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2016 bringing the full year asset sale transactions to 6.6 billion.	Importantly, our net debt was reduced by 8.4 billion during the year and currently approximates $12 billion. Our sales for the quarter totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper, 405,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. And we sold 4.65 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.1 million ounces of gold and 74 million pounds of molybdenum.	During the quarter we completed the Tenke sale in November and our previous guidance had reflected Tenke volumes for the full year. Excluding that variance copper sales were approximately 7% below the October 2016 estimates reflecting lower mining and milling rates at PT Freeport Indonesia. Our fourth quarter realized copper price was $2.47 per pound that was 13% above the year ago, average of 2.18 per pound.	Gold prices averaged 1,174 per ounce and were about 10% above the year ago quarter of 1,067 per ounce. Our unit net cash cost for the quarter was a $1.20 per pound, that was lower than the year ago period of a $1.45 per pound, that reflects the higher byproduct credits and also the improved volumes and efficiencies from the Cerro Verde project and higher volume for PTFI.	We generated operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the quarter which exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly 500 million. For the year our operating cash flow totaled 3.7 billion which is in excess of our CapEx for the year of 2.8 billion. As previously reported we completed the at-the-market offering of common stock during the fourth quarter and raised a total of 1.5 billion in gross proceeds through the sale of 116 million shares of FCX common stock.	Our consolidated debt totaled 16 billion and cash balance at the end of the year was 4.2 billion, net debt was below $12 billion at year end. We ended the year with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. At the end of December we had 1.44 billion common shares outstanding.	I'll now turn the call over to Richard who will be talking our outlook and updating you on current developments in referring to the slide materials on our Web site.	Richard Adkerson	Good morning everyone, as I started thinking about my presentation today I recall a comment that Jack Welch made several years ago and it was, 'don't be giving bows for Act I when the audience is looking for Act II', and I know everyone here is focused on Indonesia. It's the focus of our senior management team as we go into 2017, but having said that I'm very proud of what our team did during this past year. A year ago at this time our share price was well below $4 a share, our credit revolve swaps were 2,700 basis points, we were announcing a plan to reduce that and sell assets. There was a lot of uncertainty about our ability to do that and the values that we would realize.	We were completing the construction of our Cerro Verde project and ramping it up and it was a big project, $4.6 billion and big projects in our industry have been challenging in general. We're very pleased that we successfully executed that construction project and ramped up Cerro Verde in a very effective way and today it’s a long-term cash flow generating asset for our company and a core asset.	We've had a year of really strong cost and capital management, 19% reduction in consolidated copper unit site production and delivery cost year-to-year, 56% reduction in CapEx year-to-year, 17% below our year ago estimate for CapEx as we manage our capital spending. This call last year in response to a question I indicated a goal of reducing our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion, I didn't really set a time frame on it at that time, but we have reduced our net debt from last year to the end of 2016 by roughly $8 billion.	We refocused our business under the direction of our restructured Board of Directors to focus on our mining business and on the copper industry and we were able to come out of this process of selling assets and raising capital with that high-quality copper portfolio that situates our company for creating long term values for our shareholders.	Kathleen mentioned our asset sales, they're detailed on Page 4. In the first quarter soon after our year end conference call last year we announced the sale of an incremental interest in Morenci to our long-time partners Sumitomo for $1 billion and in the fourth quarter it was a culmination of a lot of work that went on throughout the year with the closing of the Tenke Fungurume transaction, the resolution of uncertainties of that transaction within the Democratic Republic of Congo, and our partner Gécamines is there.	We closed oil and gas transactions to sell the deep-water assets and the California production price is well below what our company paid for them, but at prices that were very reasonable in terms of the current marketplace. Took a lot of work, each one of these transactions was very complicated and beyond that there were a lot of alternative transactions that we put a lot of effort into to give us a set of alternatives before we settled on doing these particular transactions.	Page 5 looks at the management of our cost and capital, you can see the 19% decline in our unit cost ending the year with a unit cost net of byproduct credits of a $1.26 for last year, our free cash flows increased, our capital expenditure is decreased as expected, as a result of the completion of the Cerro Verde project but moreover by the in-effect exit from the oil and gas business where we had spent roughly $3 billion of capital in 2015 and over a $1 billion in 2016.	Copper market, in the fourth quarter, all of us have been pleasantly surprised by the recovery in copper prices as you know copper lagged behind other commodities. During 2016 it was up roughly 17% for last year, but as we ended the year we improved market sentiments supported by fundamentals in China and the U.S. and the global marketplace and global economic conditions improved.	Supply growth continues to be constrained by yearend, we were seeing more impact of supply disruptions which had been uncharacteristically low during the first half of 2016, the price required to develop new supplies is $3 a pound or better the incentive price that Wood Mack points to is $3.30 in real terms. So even at these prices, the industry is still not undertaking new supply development projects. When those projects are undertaken, it takes years to get them to the point of developing supplies, so we're in an inevitable move of reduced supply.	The question mark is demand, demand has been better and that points to a bright future for copper today we have relatively low inventory, clearly deficits in the marketplace are in our future, the question is what will the timing and extent of those deficits be and that depends on the global economy and particularly events in China, but we remain -- throughout all this, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for copper and to position our company to take advantage of it.	The world's leading copper producers are on Page 7, you can see that we rank in terms of net interest of production behind Codelco, this is excluding Tenke and adjusting our ownership interest in Morenci, if you looked at the operations that we manage, we're roughly equivalent to Codelco taking into account minority interest in the operations that we manage.	Our assets include seven copper mines in North America where we supply roughly 40% of the downstream copper to the U.S. economy, two copper mines in South America with the Cerro Verde project in Peru, El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile, which has a potential for a massive expansion in the future and then of course the Grasberg operations in Papua and Indonesia.	You can see in terms of reserves, they're basically equally distributed among those regions, so we got good diversity in terms of copper resources. Our molybdenum only mines are in the U.S. We have byproducts in the U.S. and in South America as well and then our gold sales are associated with the very large gold byproduct in our ore at Grasberg. Cerro Verde commenced operations in September 2015 and achieved operating capacity in the first quarter of 2016. The large-scale long-live reserves net unit cost decline 19% year-on-year, this is a great project and is operating very well and we're very proud of our team for accomplishing it.	Our reserves are shown on Page 10. I mentioned earlier when you look at our proved and probable reserves, they are equally distributed by region and beyond that we have substantial mineralized material that we’ve identified in conjunction with our existing mines of substantial amounts, 100 billion pounds of contained copper and then beyond that there is potential that we are qualifying now of very large amounts. What this shows you is that our company is situated with reserves that provide for a very long term future in the copper business.	We will have a steady stream of growth projects that will only be initiated when the market indicates a need to for it and we can be very disciplined about where we spend capital looking for attractive rate of return projects and looking for projects with relatively low execution risk, other brownfield expansions. So, our company is well situated. We don't have to make -- enter into the M&A market, but with our balance sheet improving with copper price outlook improving, we’ll be positioned to participate in that marketplace either as buyers or as sellers.	Now, we have our large development projects listed on Page 11. They're in alphabetical order, this is not an order that we might pursue them, but it includes six projects with major sulfide opportunities which would be each major expansion opportunities for concentrator projects.	Interestingly, five of the six are in the United States and as we look at the relative economics of investing in the United States or outside the United States, in recent years, investments in the United States have become increasingly attractive. The energy situation here with the abundance of energy and the cost of energy, because of the shale oil and gas developments in the United States has provided us low cost of energy.	We have a work force in the United States that is much more flexible. We have a none-union work force, we have communities that support our employees, whereas outside the United States, often we have to provide all the community support. So, it’s an interesting situation, what a change over the last 15 years, when this industry was thought to be dead here and now it’s a place for great investment opportunities.	Also, El Abra is on this list and it’s got a very large resource that we are doing advanced planning on with our partners looking at potential consolidation of interest in the area and it would be a very large project, but potentially an attractive one and I believer one that ultimately the industry will need to meet the world's needs of copper.	So, we've had a great Act I, turning to Act II. At Grasberg from an operations standpoint we have had continuing issues with, I'm going to say an element of our workforce and that is the workers in the Grasberg pit itself. The Grasberg pit has a known depletion point, it's been moved out to now where it will be -- we expect it to be completed in 2018, upon completion we will continue mining the Grasberg ore body as a very large block cave -- is located -- the ore body extends below the limits of the pit. We are currently operating underground in a significant way in our DOZ mine and our deep MLZ mine.	We have been operating large scale block cave operations since early 1980s at the Papuan operations of PT Freeport Indonesia and we're very comfortable about technically being able to do that. But as we've approached the completion of the pit, workers have been raising complaints, grievances and have simply not been meeting productivity standards.	We're taking steps to respond to that, the effect of this is not a loss of resource, this resource will be realized through mining activities, but what's happening is we're having lower production now which is extending the life of the pit and we're working with the union, with the workers, with our management team to take steps to rectify this and in our outlook, we give you the best estimates that we have going forward.	Now I want to spend some time going over matters that many of you are familiar with, some of you may not be, but I think it's appropriate to do it now because the Indonesian government has just issued new regulations for mining operators broadly, and it has implications for us, but it's for the industry as a whole. So, I want to take a few minutes and set the stage for putting this in perspective with what our situation is given our current contract with the Indonesian government.	Freeport signed its first contract in 1967 and then after the discovery of the Grasberg, signed a new contract of work in 1991. And this contract provided legal and physical certainty through 2041. And it was on the basis of this contract that Freeport has made a multibillion dollars of investment and we began that on signing of the contract.	In the mid-1990s we formed a strategic partnership with Rio Tinto to advance the development of the new Grasberg resource. We had a major mill expansions, we undertook underground mine development and expanded the mine capabilities for output significantly and Rio Tinto remains our partner and we have a great relationship with them.	In connection with that original contract we had a commitment to build a smelter in Indonesia, provided that was economic. And we fulfill that commitment. We’ve aggressively went out to find a partner, we found a partner in Mitsubishi, which had new smelter technology at the time and we’ve constructed a smelter in eastern Java at Gresik. And we have an equity interest in it, the majority owner the Japanese and Mitsubishi is operated -- it's operated very effectively and safely over almost 20 years of operations. Been one of the world's best smelters, have not made any money because of the economics of the smelter industry.	In 2009, the Government of Indonesia passed a new mining law and implement new regulations over, the law was passed in 2009 and it took time to put regulations in place and really the governing regulations were not completed until 2012. The law provides specifically that existing CoWs remain in effect until they expire. It also instructed the government to seek amendments to the CoW make contracts of work more consistent with the new mining law within one year.	We actually, began discussions with the designated senior representatives of government in 2011. And in 2012, the government established an evaluation team early that year to review CoWs. We’ve been in discussions with the government since 2011, 2012, but have never been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on reconciling the contract of work with the new mining law. The law says that the contract remains in effect.	In early 2014, concentrate exports were halted for more than six months following a troubling January regulation on exports. We didn’t export for more than six months. It cost the government roughly a $1 billion in taxes and royalties, it cost us slightly less than that. But a very substantial amount. In that year, we resolved the ban on exports by entering into an MOU with the government, in July, that covered six main points. Exports, smelter development, divestiture, all of these were subject to negotiation of legal and physical certainty and an extension of our operations from 2021 to 2041.	It was contemplated that that MOU would be resulted amendments to the CoW in six months. The government changed in late 2014, the MOU was extended in 2015 and we continued discussions with the government. That led to the government providing our company a letter of assurance regarding extension of the CoW, regarding legal and physical certainty beyond 2021. And it was that assurance, in that letter and in the MOU and in the CoW, the government has, in Freeport have honored this CoW since the first one was signed in the 1960s, and the new one signed in 1991, that has given us the confidence to make the ongoing level of investments that we’ve been making and developing our underground resources.	Now just in January of this year the government has introduced new regulations and these new regulations require CoW holders to convert to licenses called IUPK in order to export, and with a license in and of itself there is no assurance of legal and physical certainty and we have been unwilling to give up our CoW to go to strictly a license. And so, what I want to do now is, and this is in our slides and so you can review this and follow up with questions, but I want to point out what our contract of work actually says.	It says that we shall have initial term of 30 years from 1991 going to 2021, and that we shall be entitled to apply for two successive 10-year extensions of this term subject to government approval and that government approval cannot unreasonably be withheld or delayed. So, we have the rights to extend the CoW on its existing terms for another 20 years beyond 2021. We made application for this extension and have not yet received approval.	With regard to export, there is a specific provision in our contract that says without in any way limiting the Company's basic right to export, that we shall be -- we'll be subject to a reporting -- administrative reporting and non-monetary provisions. With respect to taxes the CoW at specifically that we shall not be subject to any other taxes, duties, levies, contributions, et cetera, except for those expressly provided in this CoW, which provides for an income tax rate of 35% which is higher than the standard rate in Indonesia and provides for royalties.	With respect to divestment, there's a specific provision that said, if after signing this agreement the effective laws and regulations of the government's policies impose less burdens on divestiture requirement than those that were in the CoW, those less burdensome requirements apply to our -- to the parties of the CoW. And what happened after CoW was signed in 1991 Indonesia in general adopted new laws and regulations that eliminated requirements for foreign ownership that triggered this provision and we have a letter from the government through its investment board called BKPM in 1997 saying that we have no future divestiture obligations.	Then there is general provisions that says the government will take no action inconsistent with the CoW, adversely conductive to the enterprise and including without taking any action or condemnation or nationalization of the enterprise or any parts there under. Later on in this CoW is an act of expropriation and nationalization. So, that's a matter that's strictly covered in the contract. The CoW also said the agreement shall have the full force and effect of law and the law that governance is the law that was in effect at the time of the contract 1991.	So, that is what our position is, is that this contract establishes rights and obligations of each party, Freeport and the government and that the government cannot change its obligations by adopting new laws and regulations. And this is part of just the general rule of law, you can’t do that in the United States or other countries around the world. If laws or regulations are changed, then any government has the right to adopt laws and regulations.	You can’t avoid obligations under contracts by the government by doing that. And if they do do that, then the government would be responsible for financial losses or damages from the breaches of these contracts. And so, as we enter into discussions with the government, that’s the basis for our position, and the government points to the 2009 mining law, and that’s the element of disagreements that we’ve had.	I mentioned this October 7, 2015 assurance letter. And it’s very important because in that letter, which was issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, it talks that the government warrants -- now this letter is in Bahasa Indonesia, and warrants is a term that we’ve translated to. I’ve been advised by our people that the law itself could -- you could use the word guarantee or warrants or assures to reflect it.	But it says that we would be able to submit proposal of contract extension immediately on implementation of the regulatory amendment and the government will not reasonably withhold or delay it. It is further understood that the approval will ensure, and this is really important, the same rights and the same levels of legal and physical certainty as contained in the Contract of Work.	So where are we today? The government issued these new mining regulations on January 12, 2017, which under previous regulations was the date that prohibited exports beyond that date. The regulations that allow our continuation of exports, subject to conditions, including conversion of the CoW to the special operating license called an IUPK. We are working with the government to deal with the reconciliation of these regulations with our contract. And what we’ve agreed to do is convert our contract to an IUPK subject to obtaining an underlying investment stability agreement, similar to what we have in other countries, which provides us this legal assurance of physical terms and other rights.	The CoW remains in effect until it’s replaced by a mutually satisfied alternative. And we have requested the government to allow us to export, while we immediately begin to discuss with the government this new license and stability agreement. Our recent discussions, we have not yet been given an export right, our very recent discussions with the ministry indicates that we will be given that right, and we will target dealing with the conversion to the license and the stability agreement within a three-month period.	So, we’re committed to start working immediately on that. We’ve been given indications that we will be allowed to export, but I want to note specifically, we have not yet been approved for that. If in fact, we are not allowed to export, the significant impact on our company. Each day, it’s 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 each month -- 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold for each month.	The nature of copper concentrate is that it's bulk material and we don’t have the ability to inventory this to any great extent. We would be allowed to ship domestically to the smelter at Gresik and we would have to restructure our business to allow us to do that, but it would be a major curtailment of our business. Unlike 2014, at this point where our company is not in a position to maintain the existing operations without being able to export.	So, we would have to take steps to curtail operations, curtail costs, that means very large layoffs and the cutbacks in capital spending, and we have developed plans to do that. I will say we don’t expect to have to do that based on very recent discussions with the ministry. But we -- it still remains for us to get these exports approval and we've been given assurances that we will.	I just want to close this discussion of Indonesia to make just some very general comments. We are one of the oldest and largest foreign investors in Indonesia. And over the history we have had a very positive relationship with the government and together we've done great things in Papua. This is I would suggest the most technically challenging mine to operate in the world, because of its physical setting and the nature of its ore body and how we have to deal with environmental issues and disposals of tailings and waste material, and the development of underground resources.	And we take great pride in what we've accomplished there, and we take pride in the positive relationship we've had with the government and our goal is to remain a positive partner with the government, but while we firmly represent the interest of Freeport's shareholders. We take pride in the benefits that our operations have provided to the government and local communities over our long histories.	We produce over $50 billion of economic benefits to the Republic of Indonesia and our future impacts would be even greater. Under our current physical terms, Indonesia receives more in taxes and royalties than any other country would receive if we were to take this mine and put it into U.S., Canada, Chile, Peru. The deal for Indonesia is very fair by international standards.	In summary, it is in the best interest of both Freeport and the government to reach a mutually accepted resolution and I believe both sides recognize this and I have confidence that we will reach this resolution that is fair to all parties and we're going to commit all of our time and resources to achieve that goal.	We'll answer questions, but I want to just point out our 2017 outlook is for over 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.2 million ounces of gold, 92 million pounds of molybdenum. The copper and gold presumed we will continue to export in Indonesia. Our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits would be about in the range of $1.50, after credits this is a $1,200 gold and $7 molybdenum would be a $1.06 for the year, this upcoming year, the year we’re in and about $1.15 for the first quarter.	At $2.50 copper, we’ll have $4.3 billion of operating cash flow each $0.10 change in copper, plus or minus $2.50, is $385 million. Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, which $1.1 billion is for major projects. The vast bulk of that is for the underground development in Indonesia and then our sustaining capital is $700 million.	Our sales profile for the next three years is shown on Slide 19, net of Tenke and Morenci transactions, we were at 4.17 last year, this year would be 4.1 and roughly 4 in 2018. And you can see our gold increases as we complete the mining of the Grasberg pit [ph] in 2017 and 2018 and our molybdenum sales, which we manage to a certain degree in response to the marketplace, and we’ve done a great job, by the way of processing our molybdenum and our downstream operations to reach a chemical grade where realizations are substantially higher than from metallic molybdenum.	Our models for EBITDA and cash flows are shown on Page 20. EBITDA between $2.50 and $3 is $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Operating cash flows are roughly $3.5 billion to $5 million between $2.50 and $3, with limited amount of free cash flow. This gives us a clear path for making our debt targets.	The sensitivities to price changes for our business is shown on Slide 21 and capital expenditures on Page 22 were without oil and gas now we will significantly reduce capital this year and next and continue to constrain capital until market warrants moving forward with new projects.	This balance slide is something that looks great to me. I mean, we went from $20 billion to $12 billion net debt from last year, from year before last to the end of last year. And then if we look forward next year with the range of $2.50 to $3 you can see our debt dropping below $10 billion. And that’s a big positive change for us.	And we’re committed to a strong balance sheet now. A strong balance sheet in this industry allows you to be protective of your Company’s shareholder values. It allows you to make investments when their warranted, it allows you to take into account operating risks and risk such as the one we’re facing in Indonesia. We’re much, much, much better prepared to deal with those risks today than we were a year ago. And it’s a major accomplishment for our company to have met the challenges of having a massively overleveraged balance sheet and getting down to where we have a strong balance sheet.	I’m really excited about our future. I mean, we’re industry leading copper, and copper in my view is going to be a great commodity to be in. We’ve got a great team of operators and developers. We’ve done all these different projects, spanning the globe, there is not a project in our industry that we could not do effectively. We've got this long-lived geographically diverse attractive cost structure resources, and now we are financially strong to be able to run our business in an effective way. So, Act I. We are working every day on Act II, as we work to keep our business safe and produce volumes and control our cost.	So, thank you for your attention and I felt -- I know I've taken some time on the call, we'll answer your questions, but I felt under the circumstances reviewing some background was needed.	Kathleen Quirk	Operator, we'll take questions now.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.	Chris Terry	Hi Richard, couple of questions from me, just trying to cut out a few of these more details on Grasberg. Maybe to start on the underground development you're going through with the deep MLZ zone and most of it the Grasberg block cave. At this point has there been any slowdown on that? I'm just looking further out to some of your guidance and comparing it to past periods. I think the 2019 guidance for example has changed a little bit, have you changed anything there or are you still waiting for resolution on the near term before you make any decisions.	Richard Adkerson	It’s a good question Chris and there's two factors here. First of all, with the fact that the pit has been extended because of the labor productivity issue that we faced, then that pushes back the ramp-up of the Grasberg block cave. We are proceeding with the development of the block cave and that has gone very well. These labor issues and so forth have not carried over to our underground operations or mill operations. And so, we are on schedule now, we slowed things down a bit to conserve capital and to make this fit in with the startup following the completion of the mining of the pit.	With respect to the Grasberg block cave development, we will not get to the point of initiating cave activities until we get the contract issue settled. But that is scheduled to occur in the future in any event, between now and 2018. Because once you start the caving, you got to stay with it or you lose resource.	So, we're progressing with the underground development, we're timing it to coincide with the completion of the pit and to a certain extent we're looking at the contract situation before we go forward with it to get to the point of actually beginning caving operations leading in production. The deep MLZ mine development is complete, we have one cave that's in operation with a number of draw points on that cave. We have had an issue related to underground stresses associated with the advancement of the cave. And that has caused us to have to put in more extensive ground support than we had originally contemplated. And that has resulted in a delay in some of the production that we had originally projected for 2017, '18 and '19.	So, we’ve had a bit of a slowdown in the development of the mine itself to make sure that we’re comfortable with the safety factors for their underground support, and that’s taking some time and pushing out some production. No lost resources, it does involve some incremental cost, but it’s something that once we identified this and this occurred during the fourth quarter, then we are taking the steps to ensure safety and the ability to produce this thing over the long term.	Chris Terry	Okay. Thanks, Richard. And then just in terms of the now, so you’re continuing to produce. So, can you just give us some guidance may be on how much storage capacity you actually have, and then when you have to make decision on that? Is that early fit that you can keep operating until before you’d need to get to losses?	Richard Adkerson	Yeah, coming into this January 12th date, we scheduled shipments to take into account the potential for a delay in granting of the export license. So, by mid-January, we had shipped our exports out under our previous license authority and shipments for the upcoming weeks are scheduled for the Gresik smelter.	Now Gresik smelter is undergoing a strike and is currently having to deal with that. So, that has an impact. We have a limited amount of storage spaces, as I indicated, and we would need to take steps no later than mid-February, if in fact we're not granted for license. So, it is something that looms in a very short time horizon.	Chris Terry	Okay, thanks. And then just the last one for me on the CapEx. Just noticed into 2018 the part that’s not the growth capital, I assume that's the sustaining capital, the 0.9. Is that representative to the business now that you’ve divested most of the oil and gas, or is that still work in progress? Are you under-spending there or can we look at that as more of a steady-state number?	Richard Adkerson	Well, we are aggressively constraining spending. And our team was just here last week with all of our mine managers, and necessity is the mother of inventions, but it’s -- we’re sharing inventory, sharing equipment, sharing people and doing every step we can do. This is not going to be sustainable at that level forever, but we're not having to increase it in the near-term horizon. But this is an aggressively constrained level of maintenance capital spending. But it is what -- we can meet our production targets with this level of spending.	Chris Terry	Okay. Thanks for the color.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS, please go ahead.	Andreas Bokkenheuser	Thank you very much and congratulations on the fantastic job on deleveraging last year. That was certainly quite impressive and I don't think it was a small thing at all. At the risk of you know being slightly predictable I also have a question on Grasberg. You've obviously highlighted your willingness to potential convert to an IUPK assuming you get the fiscal and legal certainty attached to a CoW.	If you assume for a second that you get this fiscal certainty but the government digs their heels in and says, no, you still have to divest 51% ownership. Would I be right in assuming that you will not commit the vast amount of CapEx to Grasberg if you can't be no have majority control of the mine, is that the right assumption?	Richard Adkerson	The government currently owns 9.36%, and that goes back prior to the 1991 CoW. In terms of negotiating with them over the past five years and it was an element in the 2014 MOU, we agreed to divest up to 30%, which was another 20% roughly over the current government's ownership, with the proviso that that divestment be at fair market value. And a year ago, in January we supplied to the government a valuation of PTFI based on valuation parameters of that time, consistent with the negotiations we were having with Morenci and ultimately with China molybdenum on the Tinke sale, which valued PTFI at that time at $16 billion.	We have not had any interaction with the government to review that valuation and clearly today copper markets are more positive than they were a year ago. The government has expressed over time an interest in having Indonesian ownership over 51%, but they have indicated they would want to see Freeport continue as operator and to be in control of operation. And so, the thought process as I understand it with the government, is to have Indonesian nationals in some form owning 51%, but not to be in control of the business.	Now we believe we have gone a very long way to meeting their aspiration with agreeing to this 30% and at current time we've just noted our opposition to the regulation that requires 51% for all companies, but in our case our contract requires no divestiture. And we have documentation from the government supporting that. There's no question that had we had a requirement to divest 51% from the start of this contract, we would not have invested in the way that we did.	While there has been indications that government officials, certain government officials accept the fair market value concept, my point is, you just don’t develop an asset and sell it to somebody else at a fair market value at certain point in time. And so, that remains a matter of disagreement between us and the government. And clearly, if that were a requirement, it would affect negatively our future investments for this business.	Andreas Bokkenheuser	That’s very clear. Thank you very much.	Richard Adkerson	Let me just say, while I expect that we will get the approval to export and some time to deal with developing this IUPK investment stability agreement, we will still have to deal with this regulation for 51% divestiture and the government’s intention to impose export duties and the level of those duties has not yet been published. So, we have work to do.	Andreas Bokkenheuser	Right. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. That was good.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.	Tony Rizzuto	Thanks very much. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I also want to congratulation on Act I as well. And Richard, when I listen to you detailing the articles in the contract of work in the specific areas, I couldn’t help but think that I was hearing increased frustration as to be expected in your voice. And my goodness, you look at all these -- the details in the articles and how it’s been violated over time and just your response to the last question about this 51% divestment stake and so on and so forth and the question is about operate control and all these types of things.	And I clearly heard you say earlier about this kind of very critical date, as you come up upon mid-February, which is not that far away. If these issues in Indonesia persist, would you consider, in addition to reigning in investment there, could we see Freeport look seriously at perhaps restarting some of your [technical difficulty] idled capacity elsewhere in the world?	Richard Adkerson	Well, I really think that those are independent decisions. And I don’t think we would start idled capacity just because something was happening in Indonesia. We’re going to look at the idled capacity in investment of developing new resources based on market conditions. And Tony, one of the advantages of having a stronger balance sheet, which a year ago, we were really dealing with the situation in Indonesia and other potential risk in places we operate outside of Indonesia from position of weakness. Now, our canons are loaded, and we can represent our shareholders much more strongly then we could have then, and that’s really important.	Tony Rizzuto	Okay.	Richard Adkerson	We have the rights to pursue claims against the government in the form of international arbitration. And our legal team advises us that our case is very strong in doing that. We have consistently represented to the government that we don't want to do that, I don't believe that would be advantageous for us, but I also think it would be very negative for the Government of Indonesia.	So, we have and as long as we have the opportunity to try to resolve these matters in good faith we'll continue to do it through trying to reach an amicable mutually agreeable situation. But if we get to that point where we can’t and that point would include not being able to export, then we would be left no choice and we're prepared to do that.	Tony Rizzuto	Richard just on the labor situation you mentioned, I was unaware that the Gresik smelter was dealing with a strike situation. Your own situation there as it relates to the mining operations, is there a labor contract which expires there this year? It seems like the two year -- I notice every two years.	Richard Adkerson	It's every two years and we have to again this summer begin the negotiation of a new CLA agreement with our labor union at Grasberg and that's -- under Indonesian law that's required every two years, as you pointed out.	Tony Rizzuto	Is that the expiration on that Richard, is which date?	Kathleen Quirk	September.	Tony Rizzuto	End of September, and that's to all of the workers at the mine, mill, everything?	Richard Adkerson	Well, there is you know -- our total work force, is 30,000 to 34,000 people. Half of those roughly, little less than half are employees, and a majority of employees are members of one union, and that’s the contract we're talking about. The others are contractors and certain of those contract companies have separate unions and separate negotiations, but for the major employee union, that is the contract that we've just been talking about.	Tony Rizzuto	Got it. That's very helpful, thank you.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank, please go ahead.	Orest Wowkodaw	Hi, good morning, more questions on Grasberg, specifically your guidance for 2017. Just curious what throughput rate that assumes at Grasberg, because obviously, it’s been tracking kind of below expectations given the productivity rates that you talked about.	Kathleen Quirk	Orest, this is Kathleen, the big driver of our metal in 2017 comes from the Grasberg open pit and we are using an estimate -- an average of 140,000 tons a day of mine rate and during the third quarter of 2016 we averaged a 170,000 roughly. We had forecast 160,000 going into the fourth quarter and we had some work stoppages and some productivity issues that we dealt with in the fourth quarter and so we averaged 122,000. The 140,000 that we're estimating for 2017 is very doable, but it is at risk for issues related to productivity and work stoppages, but we think it's very much achievable and potentially we could do better than that.	Orest Wowkodaw	And is that -- in your guidance reduction for '17 is that driven purely off of the productivity issues or is there an impact from the ban in the current -- the export ban in the current change?	Kathleen Quirk	It’s principally related to the lower mining rates and to the delayed start up or delayed ramp-up at deep MLZ that is affecting 2017. We do have some allowance for the concentrate delays, but we’re expecting under this plan to be exporting in February.	Orest Wowkodaw	I see. And just finally on Grasberg, Richard talked earlier about your relationship with Rio Tinto. But can you just please outline, I think to everybody, how the 40% interest is going to work with Rio Tinto starting in 2021 and how that pertains to -- whether that pertains to their stake in PTFI or at the asset level and how we should think about that?	Richard Adkerson	Okay. They do not have any stake in PTFI. The operation, even though we call it all Freeport, is actually a joint venture between PTFI and Rio Tinto’s Indonesian subsidiary. And so, they own no shares of PTFI. The numbers we present are proportionately consolidated. So, it excludes Rio Tinto’s interest in current operations, which is very small. But it also, when we report reserves and resources that’s net of Rio Tinto’s interest.	And they have an assignment of our CoW, and so it is really a joint venture and they had a varying level of participation from the time it began in -- the production began in the joint venture in 1998 until 2021. Now there's been some extensions of that date for force majeure items. And after that date, they have a 40% interest.	Orest Wowkodaw	And if you, like last time you previously talked about selling down 20% to the government, did that -- so would that have included pro-rata share from Rio Tinto or was that strictly Freeport share?	Richard Adkerson	That’s strictly Freeport share. We only negotiate with the government with respect to Freeport’s interest. So -- and for example, when I referred to this $16 billion of valuation, that is exclusive of the valuation attributed to Rio Tinto. There’s only one CoW, they have an assigned interest in that CoW, we cannot make any amendments to that CoW that’s adverse to Rio Tinto’s interest.	And we’ve been great partners since the start of this operation, and we’re in very close communication with them on all aspects of our business, technical, safety issues, the government relations issues, and so forth. So, it’s that partnership and I want to be clear, we represent PTFI, we have a joint venture partner Rio Tinto that represents their interest.	Orest Wowkodaw	I see, and is Rio funding it’s proportionate share than of the underground CapEx and the future smelter?	Richard Adkerson	With respect to the CapEx at Grasberg in the underground development.	Several years ago, we reached an agreement on how those capital expenditures would be shared. Certain of those costs are deemed to be replacement capital and there are shared on the same basis as operating costs. Some of the costs are considered to be expansion capital and their share 60:40.	Kathleen Quirk	Like the deep MLZ.	Richard Adkerson	Like the Deep MLZ project for example. Certain projects that -- for example the access -- there is a common access deep MLZ and to Grasberg and we have an agreed upon sharing. So, the capital that we report, that all these numbers in our presentation we report are report only. They don’t include cost share by Rio Tinto, those costs are relatively small right now, but will grow to 40% once the conversion to the 40% interest comes in play.	Orest Wowkodaw	Okay. Thank you very much.	Operator	Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	Andrew Quail	Good morning Rich and Kathleen. Thank you very much for the update. Just got a couple of few questions, I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but I'm talking about Grasberg again. Obviously, from that mine rates in Q4, and it probably had something to do with labor as well as mine sequencing. Can you just give us some context about what -- how much does the workforce flex down as you guys transition to the block cave?	Richard Adkerson	It's more of a transition than a flex down. Because actually underground mining is labor intensive, and over time as the open pit moves towards completion, the mine rate drops, we're moving much less waste material now than we did in the past.	So, there is less equipment, less people and we sought to transition workers from the open pit to the underground through train where we could, we also will have ongoing after the pit is completed, material moving activities associated with the waste management of the waste material that will -- that’s been taken out of the pit and placed around the pit. And we have to manage that for long-term environmental reasons.	We have activities in the loans, where we have a tailings disposal area that’s quarantined off with dikes and there is a constant effort on-going to build and maintain those dikes to execute our tailing management plan. So, I would say, Andrew, that is more of a transition than -- what was the word you used --.	Andrew Quail	Flex down.	Richard Adkerson	Flex down.	Andrew Quail	Okay. Second question was about, you guys obviously are talking about a surface water tax. Which was about 470 million. Can you give some color on that and if that was to be paid would that come this year? I realize you guys haven’t made any provisions for it, but what's the background of that, is that the government sort of playing games?	Richard Adkerson	This is a clear-cut example of why we have to protect our CoW.	Andrew Quail	Yeah.	Richard Adkerson	Our contract says we’re only subject to taxes that are specified in the CoW. And what happened here is the provincial government, not the central government, has sought to impose a water tax on us, that we’ve resisted paying because it’s not part of the CoW. And we didn’t pay it, and the provincial governors sued us. It’s gone through the Tax Court now and there was a very recent ruling in the Tax Court that was in favor of the provincial government. And it’s one of these kinds of things that we face in other countries, whereas the amount of the tax I think was on the -- was less than $200 million.	But there are penalty provisions in the law that are very aggressive and so that’s where it’s grown-up to the $350 million, $400 million level. We have made -- we have taken steps to appeal this Tax Court decision. We believe it’s wrong. We are considering submitting this matter to arbitration. But that’s what would happen to us if we went to a license without having an investment stability agreement. Under a license, you’re subject to prevailing laws and regulations. And any government can’t come in an impose taxes, fees, import duties, export duties, et cetera, et cetera, water taxes, surface taxes, vehicle taxes. And so, obviously, governments around the world needs funds of these days, and operational like ours is an attractive target, so we had to have some protection against this.	We have made very significant voluntary contributions to the Papuan community, beyond what we’re required to pay under the CoW. We began in 1996 to voluntarily contribute, along with Rio Tinto, 1% of our revenues to a Papuan development fund and that’s accumulated, the last that I saw was $650 million, it's one of the largest community development funding activities on the globe.	Freeport was just recognized in Forbes by being among the Top 50 civic mining companies, and that’s part of it. The fact that we voluntarily make this contribution each year for Papuan community development. So, it’s not like we’re trying to ignore our neighbors in the province, but we have to resist opening the door to being -- to having taxes imposed on us that’s not part of our contract. There is a real danger of that being a never-ending stream.	Andrew Quail	Richard, thanks very much. I've got one more, and it’s not in Indonesia, how about that. Switching to North America, Look, obviously copper prices have rebounded. Is there a some -- is there a price in your head that you guys will start looking now that balance sheet is pretty much fixed? You guys have done a great job there in the last 12 months. Is there -- how much of the capacity do you think is in North America that you guys could sort of may be flexing and maybe bring back on in time?	Richard Adkerson	We had an interesting situation with our scale back. operations. We went through and evaluated each project and Red Conger's here and led this effort with Kathleen looking over his shoulder. But we reviewed every operation, every segment of every operation when copper prices dropped so low to see what would be cash flow positive. And we talk about cash flow positive, it includes maintenance capital as well as operating cost and really, we did this in 2008-2009 adjusted some operations and this time when we reviewed them like operations in New Mexico, they withstood that. We shut down production that was really reclamation activities in the Miami-Globe area, the Miami mine, that's not going to come back on, that's done. And we've adjusted it to make it purely a reclamation management effort.	At our Serrida mine in Arizona it is a very, very low grade copper deposit, but a significant molybdenum component to it. And because both prices dropped, we started a plan to curtail productions significantly, we're targeting 50% or more. Well as we got into it the team there started finding ways of reducing cost to such an extent that we never cut it back as much as we initially intended. And so now we're just monitoring that. We're not making plans to take steps to invest right now to increase it, it does have future investment opportunities. But we're just managing production to meet cash flow objectives.	We did in South America, I know you asked about North America, but we did cut the mining rate in half at El Abra and that remains curtailed. And we're looking at the future development opportunity there, but we don't see stepping that up at the copper prices expected for 2017.	Andrew Quail	There's something about [Multiple Speakers].	Kathleen Quirk	We have and I think we've commented on this in previous reports, but we have ongoing work that Red and his team are doing looking at each site to see if we can change pit designs to get more -- to reduce costs and to get more production. That's not an easy exercise, but that's the kind of thing we're looking at. It's things that don’t require significant investments, that maybe we can do on the margin. But we're doing those kinds of things right now which would have a very high return.	Andrew Quail	Thanks very much guys, good luck for 2017.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.	Evan Kurtz	So, I just had a question on divestment valuation, I've heard all sorts of different conflicting reports out there and I know at one point you were hoping to get some sort of clarity on whether you could use an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and it seemed like maybe that wasn't going to work out and today there was a report out that kind of suggested that maybe that could be an option. I've also seen some other reports about the government only having to pay for replacement costs and none-entity [ph] ore and that sort of things. So just wanted to get your views there. Is that something we could see; how likely could you get most of the acquired divestment done through an IPO do you think?	Richard Adkerson	Well, Evan we believe an IPO would be an attractive step in achieving divestment plan. Because it results in a market based valuation of the business. And the Indonesian Stock Exchange is growing to be a fair market and I know from discussions with investors there would be people interested in investing in an asset like Grasberg. So, we and others in Indonesia are supportive of that. It would not be a sort of thing that we could do a 20% investment in one step on the exchange, simply will be too large. And so, we think an IPO would be maybe 5% or slightly more than that and we would work with the bankers and all of that would be dependent on market conditions at the time we launched it.	So, we think that with respect to these comments about replacement costs, there was some articles earlier this week about somebody saying we wouldn’t get any credit for underground reserves, which was a pretty wild statement. All of those things are just press comments. As I said, we have not been approached by the government to sit down and review our valuation. But with the government officials or financial advisors and we prepared to do that at any time. But we are -- there was a prior regulation that they had, they talked about replacement costs. But our agreements with the government in the MOU and other discussions have always included a requirement on our part that it be at a fair market value and we wouldn’t be prepared to enter into any kind of divestment without achieving that.	Evan Kurtz	Thanks for that color. And maybe just one follow up, if I may. Just with respect to Rio Tinto and them taking their 40% stake as you look out past 2021. How is that kind of -- how discussions evolve between you and Rio as far as if you were to pursue a path with the IEPK and maybe one of the -- those paths includes having to divest up to 51% of company in exchange for some of the other protections that you’re looking for.	How would Rio Tinto fit into that picture? I mean assuming they take 40%, would that come out of their stake, I know it’s 51% of the assets and not a PTFI that they’re looking for. So how do they fit into the picture and have you had any discussions with them on that front?	Richard Adkerson	Well, the way they fit into the picture is, there one CoW, they have an assignment in it and for any changes to that CoW, we basically have to reach an agreement with Rio Tinto on it. And we talk with them constantly, we've had good positive discussions with them, so any decisions we reach would be within. I want to go back and repeat what I said earlier about divestiture.	We only can talk about divestiture with respect -- we at Freeport, can only talk about divestiture with respect to PTFI and our interest apart from Rio Tinto, we can’t represent their ownership and that's their business in dealing with the Indonesian government on it.	So, the divestiture discussions that we’ve had to-date and the $16 billion number and all the other things strictly relates to PTFI, which is an entity that Rio Tinto has no interest in. They're a joint venture partner just like Sumitomo is our joint venture partner at Morenci and Codelco is our joint venture partner in El Abra. Rio Tinto is our joint venture partner at Grasberg and even though it’s commonly referred to as, the total operations as being PTFI because we manage them, they have certain rights with respect to operations, which we work with them on and reach a meeting of minds on plans and investment and things of that nature too. So, it is a true joint venture.	Evan Kurtz	And would they have say in the conversion from a CoW to IUPK? Since most of their rights are with the CoW? So, you have to get their sign off as well?	Richard Adkerson	Absolutely.	Evan Kurtz	Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I'll hand it over.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.	John Tumazos	Thank you very much for taking my question. Richard, could you clarify the production rate at Sierrita, is it more like half the capacity, 75% or 100%?	Kathleen Quirk	It’s about 75%.	Richard Adkerson	It’s about 75%, John.	John Tumazos	Could you tell us among the six possible sulfide mill projects which one or two are more likely to go forward first, and whether we’re talking about things that are [technical difficulty]?	Richard Adkerson	Okay. I think the first one, John, that we would pursue would be the Lone Star project, which is adjacent to Safford. This is an enormous sulfide resource with an oxide cap and the Safford operation itself is facing the end of its resource life. Although there is a deeper sulfide project there.	But what we can do as an initial step at Lone Star is mine the oxide cap using the Safford oxide production facilities and that would serve as a stripping of the material for a long-term sulfide project, which conceivably could include the sulfides at Safford as well as the sulfide at Lone Star, but that would be a major mill investment. So, I think the first thing you’d see us do is move to start mining the Lone Star oxide, which would not require the kind of major capital expenditures that a sulfide concentrator mill would require.	Kathleen Quirk	It's essentially a stripping project and would use the infrastructure that is currently in place at Safford.	Richard Adkerson	Then beyond that, you start getting into these trade-offs between Bagdad and El Abra, would be I think the two that would be right now competing for that first step.	John Tumazos	Thank you very much.	Operator	Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.	Chris Mancini	Just a quick question on North America, how would a change in corporate tax rates in the U.S. potentially affect your cash taxes paid out of your North American operations. And then also would a change in Republican administration -- but with a new Republican administration change your decision process regarding any of these potential expansion projects going forward, make it easier or would it make it more likely that you would go ahead with any of them?	Richard Adkerson	Hi Chris, that's a very complicated question, it's got really broader implications in Freeport. But let me just talk about a couple of things that applicable to Freeport. You start out by saying, because of losses that were triggered by this oil and gas activities we had, we're not paying cash taxes in the United States, and we have a very large carry forward that would shelter cash taxes for a significant amount of time in the future. And so, one thing we're watching is, in this tax reform are they going to do anything with carry forward. There is just a lot of questions about it, but I don't want to get into this because we could talk forever, and we a conversation at the business round table, but this border adjustment provision that they're talking about could really have interesting implications.	Right now, we supply 40% of the copper to the U.S. market and we pay -- it results in taxable income which right now is being sheltered. Under the way this thing is structured as I understand it, if we export that copper we pay no taxes on it. But right now, if we buy a Caterpillar haul truck and we'd use it in Bagdad, Caterpillar would have to pay taxes on that. If we bought a Caterpillar haul truck and use it at El Abra, since it’s exported, Caterpillar has to pay no taxes on it.	If we bought all the big -- right Kathleen's telling me to stop. If we were to buy all the big grinding equipment made in Germany, under this cross-border thing if we bought it for Bagdad, we'd get no tax reduction for it. If we bought it for El Abra we could deduct it in determining taxes in Chile.	So, we're just one example of it, and so this debate over tax reform and particularly this cross-border situation is really going to be an interesting one to follow.	Kathleen Quirk	But the bottom line on a change in the corporate tax rate in the U.S., right now given our situation with NOL is just a simple change in the corporate tax rate, wouldn't impact us.	Chris Mancini	Right okay and the border, it's all just so complex that it's tough to really say what the net effect will be.	Richard Adkerson	And we're also not one of the companies that’s affected by having cash off shore that has been taxed, you know repatriation issues and unified tax structure cuts, we pay more taxes outside the U.S. than we do in the U.S., the typical case is reverse of that. So, we don't have that issue facing Freeport.	Chris Mancini	Okay, okay great and then I mean right and I guess that a new administration -- I mean that in Arizona it's very favorable to mining and expansions of mines and this kind of thing and so the new Republic Administration would necessarily change your minds and I don’t think relative to expansion projects, but I guess it wouldn’t hurt -- there is the potential to stop them going forward, might be a little bit lower or does it really matter?	Richard Adkerson	Well, I would say we’ve been here in Arizona for 10 years. 10 years ago we acquired Phelps Dodge and Arizona is an excellent, excellent state for us to operate in. We’ve had Democratic governor when we first moved here, we’ve had two Republican governors now and they through both administrations have been very supportive of our business. We do things the right way for communities and the way we run our mines and so they appreciate that. So, we’ve got tremendous support by the state.	The area that we’re watching that could have a big influence on us is EPA regulations. Because we inherited legacy environmental obligations all over this country from historical operations that go back into the 19th Century. And we just entered into a settlement that you may have seen with EPA and the Navajo Indian tribe in the Four Corners area with some significant historical uranium clean-up sites. We were very pleased with that, the government I going to pay significant part of that and we’re going to deal with some of those obligations on behalf of our company. So, these EPA regulations which is a big focus of the new administration is important to us.	Chris Mancini	Okay, great. Thanks a lot.	Operator	Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.	David Gagliano	First of all, I’d actually like to start-up by saying, I agree with some of the comments earlier. It’s unreal to me how the Indonesian government is constantly changing agreements and rules over the year. But nevertheless, I guess it is, what it is. So unfortunately, I actually two -- I have two Indonesia follow-ups. Both I think are probably more clarification.	But first of all, does the investment stability agreement that Freeport would propose to the Indonesian government, which my understanding is would be the core to converting from the contract of work to this IUPK. Would that investment stability agreement include basically the same six articles that are included in your slide deck, that are included in the contract of work now or if not how with those differ? That’s my first question.	Richard Adkerson	Okay. We go back to this October 7th letter, this is a slide deck as well. And in that letter, the government gave us assurances, warranted or guarantee that under the new regulations, we would get the same level of assurances on legal and fiscal matters that we had in the CoW. So, that's the starting point and the endpoint in our view of where we go with that.	So, the answer is yes, it would continue all the important provisions related to fiscal and legal certainly that are in the CoW, they would now be in the stability agreement. And our analysis shows that the government has authority under the law through its investment laws to enter into this sort of an agreement.	David Gagliano	Okay, great. Thanks for clarify. And then back to the Rio Tinto discussion, just for a second. Another clarification question, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. If Freeport was required for whatever reason to divest down to that 49% ownership. After Rio Tinto comes in beginning in 2022, does that essentially mean the net result for Freeport would basically be that the company goes from having the rights to essentially 91% of Grasberg’s volumes today down to about 9% by the beginning of 2022 or am I thinking about that the wrong way?	Richard Adkerson	Well, if you would look through it, after what is the net Freeport interest in this, today, as we sit here today, PTFI has let’s just say virtually all the interest through 2021. Rio Tinto has a small piece of that. After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40%, PTFI has 60%. FCX owns 90% of PTFI, so it would be 90% of 60% would be 54%. If we divest --.	Kathleen Quirk	Half of our interest [ph].	Richard Adkerson	Well, if we divest, let’s say, 30%.	Kathleen Quirk	So, it's still the 20%.	Richard Adkerson	Yeah, so if we divest 20% in Indonesian interest, we'd own 30%, FCX would own 70%. So FCX would own 70% of 60% or 42% net interest. If we divest it half, FCX would own 50% of 70%, or 35%.	David Gagliano	Okay. All right. That’s helpful. Thank you for that.	Kathleen Quirk	And David, I know your speaking questions more from a big picture standpoint, but because of metal strip adjustments, the 60:40 split will probably be more like a 2023 event.	Richard Adkerson	Yeah, because that’s been adjusted for -- for example when we had the almost seven months inability to export. And we’ve had some other interruption in operations over the years that triggered an adjustment to the effective date of Rio Tinto’s 40% interest.	David Gagliano	All right. Appreciate. Thank you for clarifying.	Richard Adkerson	Okay. Thanks, David.	Operator	Our final question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.	Lucas Pipes	Yes, thank you very much for taking my question and sorry to belabor the point, but it’s about Indonesia. Richard, I think you mentioned that you are prepared to go to arbitration. And I think you also mentioned that it’s a function of whether you obtain the export license. Could you clarify as to what is the timing, let’s say, a month from now, mid-February, you don’t have an export license, would that be the time that you go to arbitration?	And then secondly, you also mentioned that arbitration would have negative consequences or there are a number of downsides for Indonesia. Could you tell us what those are? Thank you.	Richard Adkerson	Okay. To coin a phrase, I don’t want to draw a red line here. I mean, we are -- if we got to the point of where the government is just arbitrarily saying they’re not going to grant us export license unless we convert to an IUPK without conditions, then we would have no recourse other than going into arbitration. But we believe we -- I want tell you what I believe, I believe we will be granted export, and we’ll have a period of time to negotiate these things. That's what I believe is going to happen.	But the point that would trigger it, Lucas, is if the government just said no we're not going to talk with you anymore, we're not going to negotiate, you either have a choice of going to the IUPK and not exporting, then we're not left with any room on it. So that's the key.	And then, from the Government of Indonesia's standpoint, you see advertisements here of the government encouraging foreign investment. They had a section in the USA Today, you can their ads in the Charlie Rose most nights. You know they -- the country needs international investments to achieve its economic goals and I've listened very carefully to President Joko Widodo on his trips to the U.S. and at APIC and I feel very positive about his philosophy about investments and so forth. So here Freeport is among the oldest and largest investors in the history of the company -- country, and it's almost history of the company too, but I meant to say country.	And so, for us to have to a very public dispute over things like this would be negative for both of us.	Lucas Pipes	Okay, thank you, thank you very much for that clarification, I appreciate that, good luck.	Richard Adkerson	Thank you very much Lucas, and listen everyone long call, for those of you still on, thank you for your interest and I appreciate that you have a lot of questions about this Act II. You can tell just how focused we are on it. It's good to be in a position of our company, where it is -- it was a priority all during the year, I made five or six trips there year in the midst of all this other stuff. I was just there and we're going to stay with it and work to resolve this problem and then next year I think we're looking at Act III and hopefully that will be looking to invest in all these great resources that we have from a very copper market.	So, good luck to all of us and thank you for your interest.	Operator	Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today, thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

22,Sky PLC (ADR) (OTCQX:SKYAY),RIO,Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call,"January 26, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives	Jeremy Darroch - Group CEO	Andrew Griffith - Group COO and CFO	Analysts	James Dix - Wedbush Securities	Alan Gould - Brean Capital	Larry Haverty - GAMCOI Investors	Allan Nichols - Morningstar	Bart Crockett - FBR Capital Markets	Operator	Thank you, and welcome to the Sky PLC Second Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Hosting the call will be Jeremy Darroch, Group Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Griffith, Group Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This call is the property of Sky PLC. It may not be recorded for broadcast without the written permission by Sky PLC.	This call may include certain forward-looking statements with respect to the Group’s financial position, business and strategies. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, further details of which are provided in Sky’s 2016 Annual Report. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Jeremy Darroch. Please go ahead, sir.	Jeremy Darroch	Okay. Thanks good morning everybody, and thank you for joining us today. As you heard, I am here with Andrew. Now, just as I can say that we are obviously currently constrained by the take of code as a result of the 21st Century Fox approach, and therefore we’re limited to what we can say about that. So, you will understand if we can't answer all of your questions. But there is new information of course we will update the market accordingly.	In terms of the agenda for the call, I am going to quickly take you through the top line results and some highlights on the year so far. Andrew will take you through the details of our financial performance, and then I’ll outline our priorities for 2017, before we move to questions. It's been a strong first half across the Group with good performance in all of our markets, and we’re delivering well, I think, on our strategy. Revenue growth was strong up 12% and giving the benefit of a stronger euro and 6% on a constant currency basis.	Now, as you know, this year is one in which we obviously saw the full effect of a number of program renewals, including the new Premier League contract here in the UK. Despite the additional cost of £340 million in the period due to the step up of this contract, our operating profit was down just $65 million to just under £600 million, I think demonstrating the underlying progress we’re making. As the highlight of our performance is good customers and product growth with a strong Christmas trading period right across the Group, adding 500,000 new customers for the half year versus a year ago, and around 2 million additional products.	Our investments on screen are working. In the last quarter, our channels reach over 100 million people that’s up 12% from just two years and we had had a number of highlights across the portfolio. Sky 1, which is our flagship entertainment channel launched in Germany and Austria, reaching 2 million viewers in its month. Our Sky Cinema service, which gives customers a new premier every day in the UK and Italy, is proving very popular. In sports, we had record audiences to Formula One, Moto GP, International Rugby and the English Football League.	Germany, we’ve had a good start to the season with viewing of their premier domestic football series and the Bundesliga, while as one of the Premier League audiences here in the UK start the season slowly, they since been increasing and we expect the stronger second half. Our investment in on-demand is working well. In the last year alone, we’ve added over million connected homes, and we’re seeing record levels of on-demand viewing, particularly to our own channel brands. One of the challenges we have is being churn, it's higher than we would like but it's not holding back our growth.	In the UK, its 11.6%, reflecting an increased mix of broadband within our base and the promotional environment we’ve been operating in. In Germany, it's 10.6% due to the peak of customers coming to the end of their 24 months contracts. In Italy, it's down to 9.5%, here is reflecting the improvements and the customer offer that we’ve been making, and the success of our loyalty program. We have a strong set of plans in place going forward. We’ll launch a major new loyalty scheme here in the UK that offers customers loads of rewards and a host of benefits.	We ensure customers have best equipment in their homes without more volume into our customer subscriptions. We’re increasingly using analytics to right size customer to the most receivable package, and we share best practice between our attention teams right across the Group. We’ve also made good progress in our future growth plans. So we’ve expanded into new markets with the launch of Sky Mobile in the UK, and our targeted advertising service, Sky Adsmart in Italy. We’ve opened up new customer segments by broadening our offer, and obtaining to the whole household to develop our pay lite services, Sky Ticket and NOW TV. We’ve given sports to more customers with new basic channels, Sky Sports Mix, and the new Sky Sports News free to air in Germany.	We developed our products and services, Sky Q, which is our most advanced TV platform in the UK we’ve launched a whole host of new features, including Ultra HD. We’ve developed our Sky Plus program - platform with the launch of Sky Plus Pro in Germany and Austria. And there all of these services are proving are very popular. So, in total, our businesses performed well across the first half. We’re making good progress in line with our plans.	And I’ll hand you over to Andrew to talk through the detail of the financial performance.	Andrew Griffith	Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. So, as Jeremy said today, we’ve reported a good set of first half results. That started with revenue, we’ve delivered a 6% revenue growth as our fastest rate for three years, in line with the guidance that we set out at our Investor Day in October. Both for the Group as a whole and within this for each individual market too. As you look at the components of revenue in more detail, subscription revenue was up 4%, benefiting from 800,000 customers we’ve added over the last year, as well as the price rise in the UK.	Transactional revenue, by which meaning revenue generated from the sale of NOW TV sports passes, sports pay-per-view event and Sky Store with up 34% over the last two years. And in the half, it exceeded a run-rate of £200 million per annum for the first time. Over 4 million people transacted with Sky across the period. We also delivered a strong performance in program and channel sales, adding nearly £100 million of revenue, and a good example of how we can monetize investment in programs. Revenue was up from the sale of our original productions. I want to give one example we sell the second series of Fortitude into 150 different territories, recouping nearly an entire cost of the program.	We also saw an increase in demand for Sky premium channels on third-party platforms, and in Italy, we sublicensed the rights to the Rio Olympics. Against the context of a slight decline in the UK ad market, our advertising revenue was up 4%, and we outperformed the market in each territory. We currently see the outlook for 2017 at mixed with little market growth in the UK and Italy, while some more positive on the outlook in Germany.	Moving onto costs, the big impact this year is the new Premier League deal. We’ve taken an additional £314 million of cost in the first half, and there’ll be a similar amount in the second half. After which the cost to be flat for the next two years. We continue to tightly manage operating costs, and made an absolute saving this period of £24 million, that’s a particularly strong performance given that at the same, we’re rolling out Sky Q, and Sky Plus pro to every new customer in the UK and Germany, and also that includes some of the costs relating to Sky Mobile for the first time.	On the integration, since completing the final part of the merger, in June 2015, we’ve had productive 18 months. And really we’ve transformed almost every aspect to the Sky Group. Today, across our five markets, we have common product roadmap and we’re well down the roads towards the single box and a single streaming platform. Our customers see a single brand, the same channel lineup and similar marketing. We’re acquiring and creating content together, tapping into different created cultures, and sharing production across borders in sports and news. And we’ve got a set of Group’s functions, allowing us to be faster and more effective. By doing this, we’ve unlocked a deeper layer of cost efficiency. We’ve achieved our synergy target of £200 million six months ahead of our plan, and we’re well placed to double this over time.	Bringing all this together, operating profit was just under $700 million that’s lower year-on-year, but exclusively due to the step up in Premier League costs. In terms of cash flow, we’ve maintained the EBITDA of around £1 billion, whilst the working capital was lower as a result of the second Premier League in Storment falling for the first time at the start of December instead of the previous date of January, and that brought two payments into this period. However, this impact will reverse out by the full year as no payment now forsee in the second half. Looking through this, on a like-for-like basis our cash flow was pretty flat.	Net debt increased by £1.1 billion year-on-year to £7.3 billion. This is primarily due to the two Premium League payments following the first half, which was an impact of £700 million. And there was also a non-cash movement of around £250 million, predominantly driven by the decrease in sterling on a euro denominated debt.	On an average exchange rate basis that’s the basis we use in the Group's banking covenants. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio increased to 3.1 times, whilst on an accounting spot basis, it increased to 3.4 times. We continue to have a strong financial position with ample headroom to financial covenants, including excellent liquidity with cash of £1.3 billion and access to £1 billion revolving credit facility, which remained wholly undrawn for the period.	So in summary for me, today’s results show we’re executing our clear financial model well. We’ve once again delivered sector leading revenue growth, and we’re investing where customers see value on screen. I think we’re doing a good job on cost, and we’ve achieved our synergy target early. It's been a good six months, and we remain on track for the full year. So I now hand you back to Jeremy.	Jeremy Darroch	Okay, thanks Andrew. So, moving on to 2017, I always do think that the consumer environment is likely to remain some more uncertain as the impact of the many events in 2016 start play out. Against our backdrop, we intend to say flexible, remain focused on executing our own sets of plans well. This morning, in London, we talked about our plans for the year ahead. We have a strong growth agenda, clear market objectives, and a consistent strategy.	It's going to be a great year for us on screen. This will include the broadest range of exclusives for the movies that we’ve ever had. In entertainment, we will continue to showcase the best of the U.S., including the return of Billions, Ray Donovan and of course Game of Thrones. On original productions, we have that biggest year yet. 11 Sky dramas, major Sky dramas will have this year with full returning series, including Fortitude which premiers this evening, starring Dennis Quaid and Gommorah, a most popular drama in Italy, which scores over double the audience to Game of Thrones. We’ll also have a strong set of comedy, including the return of some much loved favorites, and in total with half, 100 series in production, building our pipeline throughout 2017.	In innovation, we’ll continue to roll-out Sky Q. We already have more than million boxes, now over 600,000 homes, and the viewing partners we’re seeing already encouraging with customers watching on average 10% more content, and doubling the number of Sky Store transactions they make. Sky Q will continue to get better this year with a number of new features, including voice search and control, increased personalization and the ability to record six shows whilst watching a sub.	We announced today that Sky Q will provide the platform for our first ever TV service without the need for satellite dish. It reflects our masked approach to how we deliver TV. We’d like to spend our reach and address an estimate of 6 million customers across Europe overtime, recall that won’t have a dish. Our aim is to launch in the next one or two year, probably first year in the UK with Italy and Germany to closely follow.	In service, we’ll continue to expand our leadership position with the launch of a new My sky app. It will reduce the time it takes customers to resolve their issues with the easiest and best way to manage their accounts, and to find the support they need wherever they are. We will press ahead in our new markets. We launched Sky Mobile earlier this month. It's got a range of distinct features, while customers can change their plans every month and keep any unused data to use wherever they wish.	We’re giving Sky TV customers free calls and texts with any package, a new way to add value to our subscription. And once its early days, we’re very pleased with the progress so far. Sky Sports has a 30% market share, and our aim is to be the number one digital retailer by the end of the year. And we’ll do this by expanding our retail partnerships, but also driving usage through newer platforms such NOW TV.	And then finally, we’ll be advancing towards our £1 billion adverting revenue target by rolling out targeted advertising service, Sky Adsmart into Italy and Ireland, and also launching on NOW TV, as well as extending our service to more channels with Channel Five becoming the first public sector broadcaster to join the platform next month.	So in summary, there is a lot going on. It's been a strong first half across the Group. We have a good set of plans in place for 2017. We’re taking major steps forward in the areas that matter the customers, and we’re on track for the full year. So, thank you for listening. And as we move to questions, I’d like to remind you that we’re currently constrained by the take of the code as a result of the bids, and this means we are limited on what we can say. I’m sure you’ll understand, if we can’t answer certain questions at this time. But we’d be more than really happy to take further questions.	So, now I’ll hand you back to the operator for any questions you may have.	Question-and-Answer Session	Operator	Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we’ll take our first question from James Dix with Wedbush Securities.	James Dix	I’ve three questions, I guess, first just going to your outlook for TV ad growth by market, is there any important assumptions that you could share with us including relating to the audience share that you’re expecting to get on to your channels, and your markets. Second, with regard to Adsmart, in particular, how do you see that growing in the UK market relative to the growth of the video market? Is it gaining losing share? What do you think is driving that? And are there any innovations which you would highlight on the product roadmap there on the advertiser facing side of the service, in particular? And then thirdly, just any important trends you’re seeing in the audience share for your own channel brands in the UK, and what do you see as drivers of those -- of that share going forward? Thanks.	Andrew Griffith	James its Andrew, I’ll take those. There is lot of additional color, I can offer on the TV ad growth to my comments. I think we’re very pretty cautious on the UK and Italy. There is lot of uncertainty in the general business environment. I think people -- that tending to people not to commit their budgets too far forward. And we see single-digit declines for the first quarter of the year, but we’ll see how that trades. Germany, we’re much more optimistic, I think there is broad TV market growth of around 2% and the overall. But our own ratings, the equivalent of Nielson AGF in Germany, has recently admitted that they’ve effectively understated our ratings by 16%, and they’re going to correct that from the January 1st, that we should see much faster rates of growth in Germany, both from market growth and from a bump in our own ratings as a result of that.	For our own channels, generally we’re holding our linear market share fairly flat, where we’re investing it typically in quality for customers. So, high-end content sort of thing that we run on our Sky Atlantic and that you would see on HBO, perhaps Showtime. So that tends to be not as much about driving mass market audiences. And of course, as Jeremy said, a little of that assumption is not linear. So, something like Sky Atlantic in many case is up to three quarters of the consumption were now be on on-demand basis, so it doesn’t drive as many -- as much ad meritage. We’ve got a really, I’ll just finish let's say, we’ve got a really busy year for Adsmart. Adsmart landed really well with clients in the UK, we’ve had over 7,000 campaigns from 1,000 different clients.	This quarter, we rolled Adsmart out to Channel 5, which is one of the big free to air networks in the UK, run by Viacom. It’s been improving its own ratings since Viacom bought that business, and invested in it. They are great partner of ours. And so that would add significantly to both the inventory and the weekly reach of Adsmart, four out of every five homes watch Channel 5 every single -- on a weekly basis.	Secondly, we’re going to deploy in new markets. So it's being deployed this quarter in the Republic of Ireland, and in Italy. So, it will go from one market to three markets over the first half of this year. And then finally, there is lots of small innovation that we constantly drop in for clients. So typically, that would be new data assets, the ability for clients to target campaigns sequentially, because we’re not just a linear platform in the UK, customers can see on their mobile devices as well as on the Web. We have the technology and the targeting for ads to be at follow consumption across all of those different platforms. So, they are really full like in many other areas of our business, is actually already full pipeline of innovation to drop through the close of calendar 2017.	James Dix	Just one follow-up on Adsmart, so did your infrastructure allow you to offer fairly similar service when you roll-out in Ireland and Italy as you have in the UK? Or is it going to take a little time to offer the kind of full set of features and targeting just into different markets?	Andrew Griffith	A bit of both, and the platform in Ireland is essentially the same platform, the same hardware and software and middleware as in the UK. So, that will have the same feature set on day one. In Italy, it's more of a modular approach. So, we’ve launched now with a regionally focused Adsmart targeting capability. And we’ll drop through it overtime to bring that up to the same feature set as the UK.	Operator	We’ll take our next question from Alan Gould with Brean Capital.	Alan Gould	I have got a few questions here. First on Adsmart, can you give us some idea what the CPMs you are receiving on the Adsmart product are relative to your typical advertising? Second, give us some sense of what the Sky Sports penetration is, and how that’s been changing? And third, I missed the first minute of the call, so I apologize if this was discussed. But how much of your viewing is done on the Discovery channels?	Jeremy Darroch	Alan, why don’t I take the last one and then Andrew can take on two. The Discovery channels are actually a very small part of our overall portfolio, and actually in the linear channel environment the viewing share has been declining over a long period of time. So, just as our scope is, it's done in an aggregate, something like 20% here in the UK versus where it was in 2006. The flagship channel is down 33% versus where it was in 2006. And when we translate for to an on-demand world, their performance falls off even further. So they typically deliver a share of viewing on- demand, less than the third of that that they achieved in linear. So, they’ve been a somewhat declining part of our mix for a long period of time, and that’s at the heart of our different view really around the discovery portfolio, particularly here in the UK.	Alan Gould	Andrew, just with…	Andrew Griffith	The CPMs range for Adsmart, because we’re targeting often against the clients next best available alternative, whether that’d be press ads, which is becoming less efficient overtime. Sometimes it says a piece of direct mail, if you’re looking at financial services. What we saw actually is on average, it could be careful there is quite of spread. But on average, the yield is up to 8 times, the standard industry CPMs in the UK market. So, it’s a very high yielding, little bit more what to do on the campaign delivery and the targeting upfront. But we can often get yields on the same spot of up to 8x.	Alan Gould	So, when you say standard industry CPMs, is that TV or is that all media, just kind of clarify…	Andrew Griffith	That’s TV, and in the UK that was crudely be and moved around but very crudely be 25 CPMs. So, we can get up to eight times of that on Adsmart. Look on the Sky Sports, we’ve got a very strong business in Sky Sports, around half of our customers take a premium sports channels from us. But it's also true that that’s not been the fastest growing part of our business. So, where we’ve been growing fastest is by effectively the big basic tier, and that’s driven, in particular, by the desire for a lot of the Sky’s original content, Sky Atlantic being really good example of that. So, Sky Sports is relatively stable, and it's about half of our base that takes the sports service.	Operator	We’ll take our next question from Larry Haverty with GAMCOI.	Larry Haverty	Couple of questions, one following-up with Alan on the Discovery situation. Can you give us some kind of a range of current price versus what you think of value on a monthly basis to this network? And are your negotiations there at all influenced by the fact that 21st Century Fox is increasing its investment in NatGeo, which is a direct competitor? And then I have a second question.	Jeremy Darroch	Larry, so no really, we’re not going to obviously breakout kind of commercials. But in no way shape or form of influenced by 21st Century Fox’s investments in NatGeo, or anything. Frankly, sadly, but they’re influenced by customers who pretty much voting with their remote really.	Andrew Griffith	And those discussions have been going on since April ’16 intensively. So, there is no change in any dynamic, just because of the last few weeks.	Larry Haverty	And then the second question, you guys are in the content production business, and so is everyone else. And usually when you get so much demand for realized content, the factors of production, raise their prices there. Are you worried about the cost that you’ve developed original programming? I just can't see what Netflix business, investing $6 billion, how everybody is going to have free content, but there just isn't enough time to watch it. It looks like there's some increase here.	Jeremy Darroch	So, I wouldn’t say we’re worried about it. We design our model with having a whole range of either content from other providers, which is an important. And then supplement that with our own released content. And our own produced content is locally focused, is very complementary to what we buy throughout good deals or in the spot market, typically from the U.S. And it's also a very highly and topped in terms of Europe. So actually, I think, what we’re finding is that we’re getting more ideas and we were able to develop those, but very specifically with the local content eye, because you’ve got businesses in each of those markets, and then we can do that. We’re obviously starting from a pretty low base as well, so relatively, it's small in the overall envelope of cost that we’ve got.	Operator	We’ll go next to Allan Nichols with Morningstar.	Allan Nichols	You mentioned that the Premier League viewing is up since the slow beginning. Could you give us more color on how that is comparing versus last year, and as you look at the upcoming games, how those compare versus last year and how that could affect viewing going forward? And then on the deal itself, do you have a bit of a timeline, what regulators may need to review at what timeframe they have to make decisions by? That would be very helpful. Thank you.	Jeremy Darroch	Sure. On the first one, we were down in the first quarter quite sharply, that came back. We were still down in the second quarter, but less than we saw in the first quarter. And in January, we’ve actually moved to being positive gains, so we’re up something like 6% in January in terms of viewing. Now, there was some as we talked in the first quarter and some specifics there and teams have been relegated the affect of that at the start of the season, which was affected here in all markets, actually by the Olympics. So, the good news is I think the Premier League is shaping up to be another close contest. So I think we’re hopeful as we move through the second half of this year that viewing trend that we see and will continue to move in our favor, but obviously, we’ll need to see how that develops. And it is nothing really that’s what we can say on timeline, it's all laid out in 2.7 announcement really, where we gave our view on timing. So, I just refer you back to that really, Allan.	Operator	[Operator Instruction] We’ll go next to Bart Crockett with FBR.	BartCrockett	I appreciate you’re hosting this call in our time zone. I was interested in two things, one is a little bit more color on the Discovery situation. In the U.S., when you’ve seen meaningful programming groups dropped from pay-TV operators, there can be an initial period of notable churn as people perhaps drop the services, and switch to another service set that has the content. I was wondering if you'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that you might see some of that if you have a blackout with Discovery. Or alternatively, has their viewership dropped so much that you don't think there'd be any subscriber impact?	Jeremy Darroch	Obviously, we’ll have to see. I think it’s -- our motives for these conversations is that -- commercial conversations is that the best and behind closed doors, but obviously this one spilled out, which is unfortunate. And my -- we’ll see what the effect is, my impact, there will be more the later than the former in this market. And just to be clear, if Discovery do leave the service, any money that we pay them will just going to be reinvest back into other quality content, probably with more of a local focus here in the UK. So, we don’t anticipate any diminishing in the service for customers.	Bart Crockett	If I could just be a little bit clear on this, is this dispute just for the UK carriage of Discovery, or does it stretch into Germany and Italy?	Jeremy Darroch	We’re currently talking to Discovery, both about renewals in the UK and Germany. Discovery has sought to link those. I mean we’re very open-minded about those. It didn’t cover Italy. So, at the moment, it's probably at its most acute in the UK, but we’ll see what it means elsewhere over the coming days and weeks.	Bart Crockett	And then One final thing that's a little bit bigger picture, but I'm one of these U.S. analysts covering Fox and also covering Netflix, and trying to get a little bit smarter about Sky at this point. And I was wondering if you could describe, from your view, how Netflix and S5 viewing is similar or different in terms of its impact on the pay-TV bundle from where you sit over in Europe versus the U.S. in terms of as a headwind for subscriber growth, as a headwind for viewership? And to what degree your subscribers are also using Netflix? In the U.S., there seems to be Netflix is more a complement, although it does seem to impact viewership somewhat.	Jeremy Darroch	Yes, I think here it's very much a complement. So, I mean, we don’t really see as a substitution at all. And at the heart of it, I think, it's important to remember that the relative Netflix offering in Europe is really very different I think in quality terms to the U.S. So, we see it more as a complement to existing pay TV subscriptions. The other thing to say as well as though, we have quite as different situation here in relation to the big bundle, this is essentially no big bundle in Europe as there is in the U.S. So, we offer a range of prices over satellite and cable OTT. And in fact actually we really stopped selling the big bundle probably eight years ago, quite deliberately. So, there is less of that prevalence here in Europe relative to the state.	Bart Crockett	Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you very much.	Jeremy Darroch	Okay. I think, we’ll wrap it up now. And just say thank you everybody for joining the call today. It's obviously been a busy first six months here at Sky, but I think the business exits 2016 in good shape. And we’re on track for the full year. So, we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you very much.	Operator	This does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
