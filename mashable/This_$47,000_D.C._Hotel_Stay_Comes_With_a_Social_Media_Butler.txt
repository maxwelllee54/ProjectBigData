This $47,000 D.C. Hotel Stay Comes With a Social Media Butler
Don't you hate it when you're planning to spend $47,000 for a four-night hotel stay in Washington, D.C., but you're afraid you'll be so busy with luxury that you'll forget to live-tweet the experience?
Finally, the Madison Hotel has you covered.
To honor, somehow, the luxurious experience of being one of the roughly 750,000 people who'll watch President Obama get sworn in for his second term, the hotel now offers a "Inaugural Town and Country" package.
That includes, in addition to a $5,000 gift certificate for clothes and a night in a different hotel, the exclusive services of a dedicated "social media butler."
According to a Madison press release, digital marketer Victoria Devine will "chronicle your Inaugural experience so your friends and family can follow your adventures on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest."
It adds that she will "post on all of your accounts so you donâ€™t have to fumble for your phone to catch that perfect Facebook profile picture!"
Devine told the Daily Dot that though she's never butlered before, she does have experience live-tweeting conferences for previous clients.
She noted that she hadn't worked out what, exactly, her services would be, like whether a Social Media Butler works every waking hour, or if she'll be required to come up with witty tweets on the spot.
"We haven't really figured out the details," she said. "I guess we're waiting to see if anyone buys it."
