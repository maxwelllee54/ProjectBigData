Obama Holds Boombox in Ad for Israeli Radio Station
The Israeli elections are coming up on Jan. 22 and President Obama is tuning in to news station Shapam 95.5. At least, that's the conceit of this ad campaign for the radio station. 
One, however, would think Obama had a better means of tuning in the station and that he wouldn't be listening on the front lawn of the White House with his dog Bo in tow. Another ad in the series from Y&R Israel (below) shows Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad listening to the station in his bathtub. Finally, there's Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who is shown with his radio cradled next to his ear in his bombed-out office. All three ads contain the caption "When it's important to you to know what's really going on with the [Israeli] elections."
