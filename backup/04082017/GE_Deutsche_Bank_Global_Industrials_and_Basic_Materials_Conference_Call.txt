John Inch
So, it gives me my great pleasure to introduce the management of GE, Bill Ruh. He has been with GE for four years. He was previously with Cisco Systems and he is Vice President of their Software business, I think is the simplest way to state it. So, this is going to be fascinating. This is just the rise of the machines or machines talking to machines. We are absolutely at the forefront of what could be just very powerful trends. And everyone on their phones today think of where things were even just a few years ago and where these are going to be in the next 10 years, it’s really exciting stuff and this company is at the forefront of the thought process and I think putting their money where their mouth is. With that, let me hand it over to Bill.
Bill Ruh
Well, thank you very much. So, if you look at the last decade, I think we could call that the decade of consumer internet, you have seen what happens when the internet based technologies is used to transform those businesses. I think that when we talk about the industrial internet, we are now looking at what does it mean for companies to do the same thing in the industrial space is that same transformation going to occur and we would say that yes and we are at the early stages. If we were in a baseball game, it’s probably inning two of a nine-inning game. And what that means is that instead of just the physical world, you selling machines, you are going to have to be good as an industrial company at physical and analytical. We are going to see that a product is going to be sold with much more software. And this idea of a digital twin where you can create a model of a product and test it for efficiency before you make a change is going to happen. Companies are going to have to put more sensors, more capability in their machines. Machines are going to become much more intelligent. We are going to see that companies have got to be really good at managing large volumes of data. And then finally, you are going to have to deliver that to people to actually make a difference. So, we look at the future, this idea of the industrial internet is – industrial companies being able to do this beyond just the mechanical engineering of making great products, great machines for big industries.
When you look at GE, we got started four years ago when this was not obvious and a lot of people wonder what is this all about, but I think we have recognized this idea was going to take hold and it was the next great productivity efficiency gain and a way for ourselves and our customers to add value to what they produce. So, we started that investment. We put our headquarters in the Bay Area, attracted talent, not only technical talent, business model marketing product management, grew to about 1,200. I will talk more about this, but we have delivered about 40 of these new style services into our businesses and last year generated over $1.1 billion of net new revenues on those services in our service business. So, we are on this journey to think about how to capture the value in the Industrial internet.
I would simplify this down that the – when we talk about this, there is sort of the equation is this that when we look at it, it’s how do you combine large volumes of data about machines and processes using statistics and machine learning and artificial intelligence and then couple that with deep physics knowledge around how the machines and the plants operate to achieve an outcome. And this is a little different than the consumer world and that you have to have that deep physics knowledge in order to be able to play this game. You cannot just have data and analytics. You’ve got to have the physics-based knowledge. But if you do, you can start to provide outcomes that increase the time on wing of a jet aircraft engine or significantly reduce the fuel usage on a gas turbine or provide better medical outcomes. So, for us, we see this as the next generation industrial company is going to have to have this as a core competency, because the physical and digital world is going to come together and customers are going to expect it to get these kinds of outcomes.
So, I focus every day and get measured on this area. When I think about what we do with that equation, we go to customers and talk about how to get more out of their assets through asset performance management. We talk about how they can get more out through their operations by optimizing the way a plant runs and we talk about how to help through the supply chain, how do you maintain and operate those machines more efficiently. When you look at how we value this, it’s in terms of the increase in the software sales. I am going to talk about that in a minute and show you how we see the growth in this inside the company. It’s about providing our customers more outcomes and competing at a totally different level out there and learning more about how to make our products better. And then finally, we see this is that in the future, it’s going to be about taking analytics and making that a core part of our product line just like a turbine or an engine or an MRI.
Now at the center of this, we decided that we would have our own platform that is the connective tissue to how we make all of this work. It is how we build, operate and deliver these services at a scale globally that we think is going to be necessary to do this. If you sell something into China or Kazakhstan or Kenya or here in North America, the service has to be delivered globally and has to be done cost effectively. So, for us, this idea of the cloud technology is something we can take from the consumer world and use, but we add capabilities that are strictly oriented towards the industrial world. You would never build the ability to distribute music, video or build over on this. This is meant for how you are going to manage an asset, how you are going to look at the efficiency, how you are going to control that asset better and how you are going to deliver better outcomes on a plant or on a turbine. So, this cloud is purpose built for the industrial world versus other clouds being purpose built for the consumer or the enterprise world. And from that, we think we are going to – and I can show you we are seeing more dollars per installed base because we can sell net new kinds of services on top of our services we sell today. We are seeing greater revenues out of our predictivity offerings, which is these net new services. We are seeing increase. This does accrete to the margins and its part of the margin plans we have.
We get more product feedback at a quicker cycle time that goes right back into our engineering teams to design those products better and we are going to continue to see new service offerings. As I have mentioned, we have already launched 40 through 2014. We are going to continue at a fairly large pace of providing services, because there are literally hundreds of kinds of services that can be delivered to provide these kinds of efficiency.
The other thing and then in terms of how we begin to measure this is first metric is really about revenue. When you look at what we had in our software business combined with the increase that we have gotten out of these predictivity offerings that we’ve built, we are looking and targeting this year a $5 billion revenue stream through software and services based on this kind of technology. We think we will increase that to $8 billion by 2017. We don’t just use this to sell net new. We use it for productivity gains all dropping to the bottom line productivity to our services. This year, we are targeting $300 million of net new productivity gains in our services, growing that to $500 million per year. We have been bringing assets under management. We have 225,000 assets under management. We will grow that to 0.5 million assets under management. Now in the grand scheme of 20 billion assets, you might think that’s small, but these are the assets that matter. It’s not just the small valve. These are big machines and the ones that generate value for our customers.
We will launch the Predix platforms to the market and we’ll open it up for our customers to use as well. And then we are going to continue to drive net new customer outcomes through our services businesses. Digital Wind is a good example one we launched a couple of weeks ago. It’s an upgrade to one we called PowerUp before. And we are talking about generating through software and analytics 20% more per wind farm through the use of software and analytics. We are delivering these to customers. You can see great customer stories out there, whether it’s Columbia Pipeline Group managing 15,000 miles of pipeline and making it safer and more efficient or the idea of how we take a wind farm and generate more electricity. So, some of the outcomes that we are seeing today are things like in aviation and the services productivity, we reduced the number of engine removals or these are saves on engines that we would have had to do doing it the old way using software and analytics and even talking to our customers about how they can get savings by doing water washes on engines. So these are real savings to us, real savings to our customers.
In transportation, we are doing things like service robotics, where we have a project where we taking robotics and using it for inspection in the rail yards. That can stride great productivity gains all the way to how we automate train operations. We are doing it in our factories. We are taking 16 factories and using the technology on ourselves to make our factories more productive. And it goes from making the machines smarter all the way to making the supply chain smarter. So this is another example of using this internally.
We are very focused in the cybersecurity, it’s the number one area that we think that a customer cares about when we have this conversation. We acquired the largest at the time industrial cybersecurity company Wurldtech. We brought it into the company. And we are using that to rethink as a cornerstone what we do to secure this kind of environment and how we secure machines. As we are starting to partner with different kinds of partners when you do connectivity, you have to think about working with folks like AT&T and SoftBank and others around the world who provide communication. We are integrating with Cisco into the network as a way that we can connect to machines. We are working with Intel and how to take chip technology and use it in new ways. And we are both an investor and a partner with Pivotal and their technology is that the – is an underpinning to our cloud. So we are beginning to build muscle into these – into partnering and building out these ecosystems.
And finally, very new and different is beginning to bring – to become a player in the consortiums that impact the direction this technology goes. So everything from helping to create the Industrial Internet Consortium, being a key founder of the Cloud Foundry program all the way to being involved with Intel and their Open Interconnect Forum. So when you look at it, we are making all the moves we think that are necessary to be a leader in the Industrial Internet drive productivity in our services revenue, bring out new offerings and continue to build this kind of business and then finally drive this technology to have the best products in the world for the most intelligent and able to operate more effectively and efficiently than anyone else out there.
So thank you very much. And I am willing to take some questions now.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - John Inch
Let me kick things off. And again if anyone has a question just put your hand up. We have a roving mic. So can we take a step back and talk to me about Predix, I am not sure I have – fully get the concept, so the idea is that Predix is the operating system and these apps run on Predix or just maybe a little bit of Industrial Internet 101 might be a little bit helpful?
Bill Ruh
I think John, that’s a great way to look at it. It’s the idea that if you think about iOS or Android for our smartphones, think about easy – without it, think of how hard it was to load an app on to manage a device. Think about the equivalent for industrial machines, that’s what Predix. The ability to take an industrial machine and an industrial plant, be able to capture that information easily and efficiently to be able to analyze that data and then to provide insight to maybe someone in the field to be able to operate it more efficiently. So it is the equivalent of an Android or iOS, but for the industrial world.
John Inch
So a machine has sensors that capture operating data and the data in turn is fed into what a handheld device or something with Predix running the software on it, that in turn goes back and gets crunched, just again how does the flow mechanic really work, it’s a little...?
Bill Ruh
Well, parts of Predix actually sit in the machine.
John Inch
Sit in the machine, okay.
Bill Ruh
And allows you to know where are all the sensors are, manage them. It allows you to have good hygiene and security at that machine. So no one else can come in and control that has the ability to know what to do with the data. Do I analyze it locally, send it back to the cloud, then it has the ability to get some insight from that and says if I make a change to the curvature of the blade on a wind turbine, I am going to be more efficient. So then that information actually turns into action that leads to greater outcomes.
John Inch
So if I am power customer of GE, I hire you, you come in and retrofit my install base with the Predix and the associated sensor that are required and then what on a regular basis, is the information real time monitored or do you have to come in as sort of part of a diagnostic effort to come in and then say, now we are looking to machine, we are going to run all this stuff and this is how you should be sort of operating your machine?
Bill Ruh
It’s real time monitor. And I want you to think about this way is that the old way you would take months and years to make these things happen. We think in terms of hours and days maybe weeks, the ability actually gets this installed, operating and running, because we think that the world has going to need these kinds of solutions at scale to be able to get the efficiencies.
John Inch
Okay. If I am the customer right and I could be a hospital customer or a power customer, what is that you are then going to tell me to do, you are going to get this diagnostic information per our agreement and then what do you do, do you in turn control the machine in some way remotely or do you give me a list of suggestions that say, hey run it this way, turn it off this way. I am just again trying to get down to basic practicality of how this is going to work?
Bill Ruh
It’s first, usually a customer wants to start with the first. They actually want to have their people see the results get comfortable with it that they believe it. And then they will automate some things not everything, but in the end you have to get an insight into a person that says this isn’t operating efficiently. And a good example is recently we went to a large LNG facility. We – they were looking to get more efficiency out of their entire operation. And we do an analysis that here is the analytics that we can – that we have that we can apply to the sensor data you have. And it’s going to tell you these five things. And we think if you do those five things, it will generate $100 million of efficiency or savings to you to your bottom line. Usually they want to see it. So then you got to be able to put it up and we did that from the start of that conversation to the first day we implemented and gave them insight to their field personnel in 60 days.
John Inch
And what could be some of those things kind of at a practical level, could it be the way the machine is turned on or something or I just?
Bill Ruh
A good example of this is how you in an LNG plant, they have a startup and a startup isn’t like flipping a light switch, it’s a very long process. There is lot of inefficiencies that can happen in that startup process. So you are analyzing everything from the beginning of what’s the best way to start it up, then you are monitoring it as it goes along so that people are taking the appropriate action to ensure that startup actually occurs, in a lot of cases these startups have a problem and then they have to start from the beginning. So we want to make sure that you never have a problem. So a good example was it always starts up and it starts up in the most efficient least amount of time so you are generating your revenue as quickly as possible.
John Inch
Now is Predix, is it an open architecture platform, in other words I am trying to think of the example of Apple versus Windows or something, is it – can you run with it sort of – are you trying to – I mean, how do you make it like somewhat ubiquitous, I guess that would be the one of the ways that you could if you created these networks actually now a days that you kind of put GE at the forefront of what’s obviously an early innings transition in terms of the technology pertaining to these big installed bases of these companies?
Bill Ruh
There are – certainly we use a lot of modern technologies, the same technology a lot of the cloud people use to be able to manage their cloud visibility. So Cloud Foundry will be a good example of advanced technology. We both invested in and used out of the commercial world. We have created a lot of technologies. So security is unique, now we protect the machine and the connectivity to that machine we build out. So, those things we make available to people to use openly to anybody in the world who wants to use that technology.
John Inch
And this just doesn’t have to be for GE machines, is that correct, this could be anybody’s system although...?
Bill Ruh
Yes. Let’s take the Colombia Pipeline example. We are using sensor data from our sensors and from a lot of competitors’ sensors. We are analyzing all that data. We are pulling data from their SAP systems and pulling that together into a risk model that looks across that pipeline and tells them what are the highest risks we have – so they can begin to optimize where they send their people to work on first. They can look at a long-term strategy say for 12 months as to what capital would be most efficiently spent in which areas and these pipelines you have some of these things are 40 years, 50 years old the equipment in it. So being able to manage that complex an environment, it’s not just our equipment, it’s a lot of people’s equipment, it’s a lot of people sensors where we bring is our knowledge about how the physics if all this work as we usually have some of the most important equipment that is being brought in.
John Inch
Well, this was sort of my concept of open architecture, in other words, Predix will work with anybody’s hardware, is that fair?
Bill Ruh
Absolutely.
John Inch
It doesn’t have to be configured in some sort of a manner…
Bill Ruh
It’s agnostic to the equipment in the plant.
John Inch
Okay. And then what are the – if I am a customer right and I have this equipment in my installed base, what are my options to like if I want to use Predix, what else could I be doing?
Bill Ruh
Well, the biggest – the two biggest options today are do nothing and do-it-yourself and because the industrial world hasn’t been an area that people have put the attention into. So, if you are starting a consumer base application company, you have got lots of choices. If you want to go on the industrial world, there hasn’t been any choices that existed. So, it is all do-it-yourself or do nothing. And now I think that we are seeing some of our competitors are making moves out there and announcements out there, we think that’s good for where the world is going.
John Inch
No, this maybe a faulty analogy, but think of it wasn’t that long ago that we had how many search engines available to us 25, maybe more and then we kind of have one. So, this is starting almost from offices point, I mean, unless I am wrong, we don’t have 25 Predixes that are competing. We simply you are a first mover. I am assuming the Japanese and possibly the Europeans are trying to do this too. I mean, is there a sort of a framework that everyone eventually kind of gets together and Predix becomes a standard because they are not so much selling Predix as your ability to leverage Predix and manage sensor rate data. It’s not kind of correct?
Bill Ruh
Yes, I think that what we are going to go through is the phase now, where there will be a couple of choices, probably much more than a handful, let’s say of choices that we will have here. We are seeing early indicators of several other clouds coming to market. And like anything, you will start to see a lot and then the market will start to boil down to a handful of choices. We think like the mobile market you will see two, three, four choices that will appear. And so I think first mover advantage is very important. We however also we help create the Industrial Internet Consortium as a way to show interoperability and work with everybody’s stuff. And I think that, that will be important. So, we are open to joining consortiums and other things to help to set standards or be a part of standards, incorporate those into what we do, but we think what’s going to happen is there will be a bunch of choices that will come out and then like every market it will come down to a few over time for the industrial base like we have seen in the consumer and the mobile market.
John Inch
And Bill, you mentioned GE offers 40 applications I believe today.
Bill Ruh
Yes.
John Inch
And I think you also in your pitch referenced there were hundreds of thousands of prospective users sort of dynamic interfaces or something. I mean, how do you sort of manage I guess bloatware of apps?
Bill Ruh
Yes.
John Inch
I mean, you don’t really want to be in a situation where GE offers a menu of thousands of applications that just seems somewhat mind-boggling and problematic in terms of managing the complexity perhaps both on your end and the customer end.
Bill Ruh
I think that if you were in 2007 and you said you were going to have 1 billion apps available to you on your iPhone, you would have said that, well, isn’t that too many? I think that the fact is that I think we are moving into a world where there is always going to be innovation, small apps and what people really want is the ability to choose and connect. And if you go in today’s world, the traditional world of software in these plants is the spoke applications that don’t integrate that take years to implement and we are going to have to move on what is essentially what the consumer world is the ability to very rapidly connect and create these and pull them together to solve your problems. So, I think that the reality is that there is going to be lots and lots of apps. There already are. There just has to be a way to structure them for speed and for integration. And today, that doesn’t exist like it does on a consumer world and we are going to see that in the industrial world over the next decade.
John Inch
Now, this is perhaps a little far out. I mean, on one hand, there is a parallel with social networking. On the other hand that we are just at the consumer side of this versus the industrial, on the other hand, the endgame of this is to optimize a customers’ assets that they have invested in right in some respects to drive greater efficiency, perhaps to prolong the extended life or just it’s about profitability and maximizing income don’t you get into a stasis where down the road there is going to be limiting returns, because all of the owners of the installed base have more or less adopted this stuff and in turn, you can only kind of get so much efficiency out of an old power turbine or an old aircraft engine or something. So, I am just wondering if in contrast to the future of social media, right, is there almost a start and kind of more of an endpoint for the industrial side of this?
Bill Ruh
No, I think that Moore’s Law, which is the law about how the processing power doubles and gets cut in half the price, yes. So, Moore’s Law applies here as well. I think what we are going to see is that people have been really innovative about collecting data and getting insight and we can call it magic, but we are going to predict events before they happen. So, we are going to predict the part failure. We are going to predict demand in ways that we haven’t before. If I had perfect knowledge, now you might say when we reach this, we have reached the endpoint. But if I have perfect knowledge on operating so nothing ever breaks and I have perfect knowledge about demand curves and how I can optimize myself for those demand curves to make the most, yes, I reached that point, but I think we are pretty far way from that. So, with that said, I think we are going to see this idea of magic predictive analytics is going to continue to move forward. So, the point where we finally do reach that nirvana, but there will be the next set of innovation and the technology to deliver energy or healthcare in new and different ways that will come out.
John Inch
Now, isn’t one of the risks from GE standpoint is though that you are extending customer lives in many ways right of their installed base, which more or less takes away from the company’s ability to sell them new product. And I guess where I am going with this is, is there an angle not only just on the installed base of older equipment, which would seem to be ripe for being targeted for Predix, but what about a new equipment too? So, you can kind of make a sale so that you are not ultimately cannibalizing your own sales of new products, you can work with new to kind of get those efficiencies into the field, if you will?
Bill Ruh
Well, I think that these things work hand-in-hand, right? I think that yes, people want to get the most out of it, but you are still going to have generational physics-based upgrades via materials or whatever else to get better fuel savings that will be used in combination. So, what you want is to be able to have the net new next generation product like our H turbine come out that is just game changing in the market. Then you want the ability to take the existing installed base or once you have sold that to have more dollars per asset and services that gets sold. So, I think you will – you won’t see the end of those upgrade cycles. I think what you are going to see is that they will probably exist for about as many years as they are, but I think what you will do is you will have greater efficiency that you will continue to bolt on over that course while you get to the next major materials upgrade or greater efficiency and the design and so on.
John Inch
And just to be clear, this stuff is mostly sold for existing installed older basis, is that correct, like for instance, if I wanted to buy an H turbine or a Tier 4 locomotive, am I – can I also – are you trying to push like the Predix package with this to optimize it kind of from day 1? Is there an advantage to that or do you really should just wait and let the equipment age for a little bit and then come back to GE and say, hey, how can we make this run back to the way it used to run?
Bill Ruh
It’s day 1.
John Inch
It is day 1.
Bill Ruh
Because actually when you look at it we are getting – when we talk about some of the productivity gains, they come in the warranty period, because we are using it for ourselves in the warranty period, we are demanding that when we sell it, we can actually reduce our warranty cost, because we get insight into how to better service them in the warranty period. So, some of that does accrue to us and is required, but that is exactly why you want to do it on day 1 is for yourself to get a better product out there and to reduce kind of costs you are going to have in the warranty cycle.
John Inch
Can we go back to you did $1.1 billion, is it $1.1 billion this year or that was last year?
Bill Ruh
2014.
John Inch
2014, you think you are going to do how much in ‘15?
Bill Ruh
I don’t think we have announced that.
John Inch
Okay. I mean, what was...
Bill Ruh
We will have double-digit – we do announced double-digit growth on this in this area.
John Inch
Okay, of the $1.1 billion I assume is there way to break that down insofar as like how much of that comes from service versus equipment? Does it even delineate in that manner or not necessarily?
Bill Ruh
It’s almost all in services.
John Inch
It’s almost all in services.
Bill Ruh
Yes, because that’s – you have existing products out there, right? We are going into the installed base. So, the services, this is natural place to begin to start this kind of exercise. And so everything is about the installed base, it’s almost all – if you look at that across it I think the power and water business has been a big beneficiary of this. As I mentioned, we just announced the digital wind farm and that’s a service where we are going to the customer, we sell it as a offering up to 20% more power generation, where we share those end results.
John Inch
I assume all of these revenues are for GE today, right. So there is no – there can’t be very much Predix on other non-GE products or is that not true?
Bill Ruh
That is – well, it’s all for GE. We do like if you take the intelligent pipeline at Columbia, that is across many, many customers, but I think we at our Minds and Machines, we did announce last year at Minds and Machines, we would make Predix available to customers. We are – we have not announced who, but we are using Predix with other industrial companies who are putting it on their machines and we will discuss that at Minds and Machines when we go general availability with Predix.
John Inch
Okay. How many people are in California?
Bill Ruh
1,200 in California now.
John Inch
And is that the right complement or do you see that to truly tap the Predix sort of vision here, do you kind of double that or triple it or drive is that at sufficient scale today?
Bill Ruh
Yes. A big part of our focus now is how do we upgrade the 10,000 other people that exist around the world and make them and bring that kind of skill set, because when you move into this cloud world if you look at the way you do development it’s foundationally different than the Silicon Valley style approach of agile and screen programming things like that. So we are taking those skill sets and we are now bringing out to the 10,000. I think what you will see is we will probably continue to grow at some pace, but a lot of the emphasis now is how you scale it out globally.
John Inch
The critical mass is more or less…
Bill Ruh
Yes.
John Inch
Okay. And then how does this work, if I am a customer do I sign a multi-year agreement with GE or are they significantly 1 year agreements or are they add-ons to contractual service agreements that may already have existed for power customers, like is there a defined formula yet, but kind of makes up the $1.1 billion?
Bill Ruh
I think it’s there is multiple business models. I would say the subscription is the – this is all becoming subscription based.
John Inch
It is, okay.
Bill Ruh
And I think that when you look at it…
John Inch
So I don’t choose from a menu, look I want Predix in this app and then you can come in twice a year or something like that that's more of a…
Bill Ruh
I think you can choose apps on Predix and expand the subscription. Usually they start in one area, that’s the biggest efficiencies and then continuously adding more capability over time.
John Inch
Okay. And then how – you have all these partnerships with all these companies?
Bill Ruh
Yes.
John Inch
How do those fit into this in a way – does it mean that you are reliant on other companies or are you trying to leverage sort of advances in their own technology or trend or I mean just trying to understand, it’s almost a question of how integrated is GE in terms of rolling out these products and services versus reliance on other companies per se?
Bill Ruh
Well, a good example is the service provider, telco partnerships. We aren’t going to provide the communications between all this. We need somebody to partner with to do that. So those partnerships are natural for us. Then you move into – they also help us go into non-traditional GE Industrial customer. So with SoftBank we are already working with a large number of customers who we hope to make them Predix customers, who would use to do – to enable their own businesses in the same way in technologies and business we are not in, whether it’s in elevators or other kinds of technology.
John Inch
And those customers I mean in terms of the infrastructure, they are going to be sharing in the revenue, is that correct, in other words if I am customer, I am going to be paying GE for certain pieces of it and then I probably have to pay for the communications side, so in theory the market today in terms of what you carved out is much bigger than $1.1 billion, it’s probably significantly bigger than that?
Bill Ruh
That’s – if you look at the cloud platform that’s the whole idea of the cloud platform is the ecosystems or the ability, you are never going to build all the application whenever you build the best applications, but much like what we see in the consumer world the ability to take the subscription fees on what others do, enable them to do it faster than they could by themselves. And – but take part of that those revenue streams is certainly a part of what it needs to be a platform for.
John Inch
And how far penetrated are we within GE’s installed base would you say today?
Bill Ruh
About 50% of the $5 billion of revenues based on Predix today and by the $8 billion we will have everything based on Predix. All of the businesses are participating. We even announced with the lighting that with lighting they are putting sensors into the light. We are pilots for example, San Diego and Jacksonville with – where they are using those sensors to build the smart city. So parking, looking for parking problems, safety problems, air quality and things like that. The light bulb is no longer a light bulb, it’s a smart city for free with it. So you think about that idea of Predix being used in every product it is opened up their mindset about what it means to be in the businesses they are and how they can rethink their own strategies as well. And think about it, lighting going from selling a light bulb to sell an intelligent infrastructure, intelligent buildings, intelligent cities that’s a long path but they would move very quickly because of the Predix platform.
John Inch
And this could frankly move that much faster as it continues to be, Bill.
Bill Ruh
Absolutely.
John Inch
Great. We are out of time, fascinating stuff. Thank you so much Bill. I appreciate it.
