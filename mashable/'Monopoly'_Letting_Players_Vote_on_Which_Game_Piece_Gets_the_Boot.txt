'Monopoly' Letting Players Vote on Which Game Piece Gets the Boot

Will this be the Scottie dog's last lap? Or will it be game over for the race car? Hasbro has invited fans of Monopoly to decide which iconic board-game piece will be replaced by a new token.
Using Facebook or Twitter, fans have until Feb. 5 to tell Hasbro if the battle ship, top hat, Scottie dog, race car, iron, wheelbarrow, thimble or shoe should go "to jail." They then have the option to the choose the replacement token from a diamond ring, toy robot, cat, guitar or helicopter. 
Those interested can vote on Monopoly's Facebook Page or by using the Twitter hashtag, #tokenvote, to share their favorite token. 
Monopoly was invented in the early 1900s by Elizabeth Magie, though the version we know today was popularized by Charles Darrow. According to Parker Brothers, Darrow's nieces originally suggested using charm bracelet charms as game pieces, thus the tokens were born. Six of the tokens were released in 1935, while the Scottie and wheelbarrow were released in the early 1950s; the lineup hasn't changed since.
After the votes are counted, Hasbro said it will discontinue the current version of Monopoly, and replace it with a version that includes the new token later in 2013. There will also be a special edition of the game with all the old and new tokens in a gold-colored box.
