And the day continues and our next presenter is General Electric, the biggest market cap here. And GE is a highly diversified global industrial corporation. You all know what GE does. And I’m very happy to have here, Mark Begor, Senior Vice President, Energy Management. And, Mark?
Mark Begor
Thanks, Andrew. I’ll take you through an update on Energy Management. You’re probably familiar with the GE portfolio of businesses. Energy management is our electrification business, one of eight GE businesses that we run in the portfolio today.
I think you’re also familiar with the pivot that GE is under to really move towards a larger industrial company and a smaller financial services company; and Energy Management, to be one in the industrial businesses is a big part of that pivot.
Here just to look at Energy Management, we go back to the roots of General Electric. One of the first GE businesses was transformer business and electric motor business, which is still a part of Energy Management today. We’ve been around for a long time. You look at our revenue, a little over $7 billion, very diversified across a bunch of industries. Utilities are about 20% of our space. The electric grid, both the transition and distribution space, but you see oil and gas at 10%.
Marine a new industry for us, which I’ll talk a little bit about a 10% industrial, another 10% at telecom and datacom center, where we do a lot of data center work, electrification of data center is about 10%, commercial and industrial quite large for us, where we’re powering factories, commercial buildings, all the low voltage products that go in there at $3 billion in our small military business; so really the generation, transmission, distribution, control, monitoring, protection of electricity everywhere from generation, which is another GE business, our Power business for the use of Energy Management.
Our solutions really expand the Energy Management value chain. Grid Modernization is a big part of what we do in the - with utilities. The Protection & Control is another big part of our business, that’s our Industrial Solution businesses, which I’ll talk about. And then the transformation of electricity, where we’re really turning motion into electricity and electricity into motion, and then managing and controlling electricity is our Power Conversion business.
We sell products directly to either OEMs or to customers. We do integrated systems, turnkey kind of solutions is another part of the business, and really focused on delivery, but a broad and deep expertise there, a very global business. U.S. is about 50% of our business. We’ve got about 29,000 employees. We operate really in every country around the globe. I’ll talk a little bit later about the Alstom Grid acquisition and what that does to Energy Management. We will be talking the Alstom Grid business into Energy Management and really we’ll change our profile globally quite positively.
It’s a - Alstom Grid is very big outside the United States. Energy Management is bigger inside the United States, or gives us a very large global footprint, but you can see where we operate around the globe and where some of our factories are. We like the fundamentals of electricity. You heard from Siemens earlier. You’ve got a lot of energy really the businesses here this week in electrical generation related businesses.
As you all know that electrical demand continues to grow. The fundamentals behind this business required attractive 78% growth by 2040, doubling by 2050, the need for electricity, so that’s a big deal. A lot of that in emerging markets, and I’ll come back to this point that Energy Management really has the ability to partner and piggyback half of our Power business, in our Oil and Gas business, our Distributed Power business and our Wind business is a big win to those markets and really bring our electrical products with it.
The aging infrastructure is another fundamental that’s attractive to our business. If you go to many developed markets around the globe, the grid infrastructure is 40 plus years old. They say that the grid infrastructure has a 40-year life, but it keeps living, but that’s going to be continued investment going forward. The all distributed power whether it’s from renewables and solar or wind also put infrastructure requirements on the grid and that’s an attractive fundamental for our business and the grid market we expect to grow.
The last one is energy efficiency that growth in energy efficiency really requires an infrastructure investment whether it’s at the industrial level, at the grid level, or even at the commercial level, that’s quite attractive. And we’ve got a lot of products that we’re bringing we have in the marketplace that really help the use of electricity more efficiently that is a fundamental.
So a lot of things we like about the fundamentals in the market are why we are in the Energy Management and Power business. Here more specifically about the Energy Management marketplace and environment, the way we look at it and like the products that we sell at the $150 billion market annually. You can see some of the growth rates next to that attractive. We’re going to spend some discussion this morning about oil and gas, I can talk a little bit about ours, which is our exposure in Energy Management is quite small.
There’s obviously larger exposure in other parts of GE, particularly in our Oil and Gas business. But Marine industry growing at 8%, technology, commercial and industrial, there is a lot of long-term fundamentals that are quite attractive to us to be in this space, which is why we like the Energy Management business whether it’s at the long-term, demand for oil and gas the global data processing boom. We’ve got a business that, as I mentioned earlier, that’s focused on servicing those data centers and providing electrical equipment to them. The renewable distributed power growth is a big deal and then the aging infrastructure.
Right hand side, you are familiar with our competitors, again kind of their like businesses to ours. You see us down at the bottom there at about $7 billion and roughly 3%, little bit over 3% pre-tax margins in 2014, obviously not where we wanted to be. It’s a kind of growth opportunities we have to take share in this marketplace, we view is quite attractive, and again I’ll come back to this in my presentation. But when you add the Alstom Grid business and we’ll go from $7 billion to closer to $13 billion of revenue.
And really our big focus is moving our margins up from that 3%, up in those teams that our competitors have, and I’ll talk about that, because those are the kind of profit pools that are available to better execution and the better kind of cost structure that we are driving in our business.
Three businesses inside of Energy Management. First, industrial solutions, it’s about $4 billion business for us, it’s our low voltage and medium voltage business. We have power equipment, power components, critical power, service business, and also some controls that sit inside this business. We fell into the industrial marketplace, the oil and gas marketplace, the data center marketplace, mining, and distributed power and power generation attractive to us is the connection with GE, which I’ll come back to, that’s a real leverage opportunity for us when our GE sister businesses are out selling distributed power piece of equipment.
There is low and medium voltage equipment and high voltage that goes around that. It’s a growth opportunity for us to really sell in partnership with the GE business, and I’ll talk a little bit about where we’re investing both here and the other parts of the business. Our Power Conversion is our - is an acquisition we made - that we married with our rotating machines or motors business a couple of years ago the Converteam acquisition, that those of you who follow GE are quite familiar with. This is a business that is a big growth market for us. We’re about $2 billion in revenue. We’ve got a $3 billion backlog. We’ve been winning in the marketplace quite successfully, three principal businesses in - or opportunities on how we go to market here.
The first is motion into electricity, where we are selling in whether it’s solar or wind or high growth power inverters and converters and also generators into the space, adjusting the frequency and electricity into electricity, as we call it, same thing, convertors, invertors, railway substation. In solar farms, the inverter that converts that electricity to go out to the grid is one of the products that we sell into the marketplace.
And then lastly, electricity into motion is really where we take our drives in electrical control equipment along with the electric motor business that we have and sell into the, whether it’s compressors and hoists into mining applications, into mills and pumps and oil and gas in pipelines, that’s really the business that we have there.
So this is a business that, a very global business. It’s one that we’ve been quite successful and winning in the marketplace. Just a few weeks ago, we announced $180 million deal here in the UK for a tidal generation business called Swansea that, we’re going to provide all the electrical equipment to, as well as the electric generation equipment, that’s about $180 million deal, it will be added to our backlog.
The third business is our Digital Energy business. This is our high voltage business that’s focused primarily with utilities there around the globe. This is a business where we’ll marry the Alstom Grid business together with Digital Energy. They are in the same space, and I’ll talk a bit more about that. But we sell the power delivery equipment, so the high voltage kind of equipment, the grid monitoring and control products very attractive space for us, and grid automation and also software is a very big business here, where we sell to both the transmission and distribution utilities on managing their grid and managing their infrastructure, that’s about $250 million business for us.
And then we also have a small projects business, where we are doing turnkey substations for the transmission and distribution marketplace. This is a place where we get much bigger through the Alstom Grid business, but $1.4 business and one that we’re excited about what Alstom Grid will bring to us, and I’ll talk about that.
A very broad customer portfolio, I talked about the different industries. You recognized a lot of names on here. What’s really a real opportunity for us and one that we are really taking advantage of is the connection that the GE Power team was in here presenting this morning, Steve Bolze or Lorenzo Simonelli who runs our oil and gas business was presenting. You can see a lot of these names on here also. So that GE connection, where we can go in with a full suite of GE products to an oil and gas customer, a power generation customer, and bring not only the generation capabilities, but also the electrical equipment capabilities is a big opportunity for us, and I’ll talk a bit more about that.
We’re investing in new products like every other business out there. This is a business that I would argue, I’ve been running the business for a year now, was neglected a bit inside of a GE System from an investment standpoint and products. And you can see, we’re ramping that up at about 4% of sales, which is at or above most of our competitors’ reinvestment rate in new product introductions. I’ll talk a little bit about our breakers investment, which is a big one, that’s a refresh of the whole product line. But switchgear, rotating machines, controls as well as software are some of the areas that we’re investing in, in order to drive not only product capabilities that’s going to give us a better position in the marketplace, but also cost capabilities, so it improves our cost position, that’s going to increase our margins.
FastWorks, if you follow GE, it’s one of the tools we’re using in our new product introduction process. We put it in place a couple of years ago. It really leverages off some of the Silicon Valley kind of a speed to marketplace, traditionally in replacing a product. In this case, this is our breaker product, we call it now GuardEon. We typically take five to six years to do that new product introduction, the engineering, the design, the manufacturing capabilities.
Through the introduction of FastWorks, where there is a lot more testing control, a lot more customer interactions through design process. We’re taking that five to six year product introduction that’s typical in the marketplace for a product like this, down to two years. And that’s really quite attractive to us to get the product in the marketplace quicker. It allows us to do it at a lower cost. You can see in this case, we’re taking our part-count down, which is going to drive cost. Our competitors have a part count of like 460 parts in the breaker. Our legacy product, that’s 580, and we’re going to introduce it at 440. That’s going to really drive our margins not only from a historical basis, but also give us cost advantages versus our competitors.
You can see our cost when we introduce this product later this year, it will be down 21% versus our legacy product. That’s going to drive margins, which you can see CM going up 700 basis points. And then we’re going to do it in a more efficient way through platforms, which I’ll talk a bit more about, but really consolidating a lot of our legacy manufacturing capabilities to drive efficiencies and cost is a big focus for us here.
So this FastWorks initiative is a GE best practice. All the GE businesses are using it to really get products into marketplace faster, with a lot more customer interaction that’s going to drive speed to marketplace. You may have heard in some of the GE presentations about what we call the GE Store, but really the benefits of being in a big diversified business like GE, where there are a lot of similarities in our industrial businesses, particularly around the energy space.
Some of the natural synergies in the GE world would be between our land-based turbine business and our aviation business. They’re very similar. There are a lot of synergies that take place from a technology and R&D standpoint across those businesses.
With regards to Energy Management, we’ve got a lot of capabilities, where for example, on what we call, GE2GE, where we’re really supplying Energy Management products to the GE businesses. For example, in Controls, if you look at any GE business that we have, there is a control element that to run the motor to run the drive, to run the power plant, to run the wind farm. And we’re really centralizing around an Energy Management control set of platforms that we’re supplying across the entire GE portfolio. The same thing with motors and generators, we sell those externally, but we also sell them into the GE business.
There are also drives, and controls, and switch gear; in all of our electrical products have inside of the power island of a distributed power aeroderivative or in some of the larger class gas generation equipment, they got control equipment there that comes from Energy Management. So that’s some of the synergies.
The other big synergy that I’ll go a little bit deeper on is what we call, GE4GE. And this is really partnering with our sister businesses when Steve Bolze’s power team is out selling in H Class turbine, there is a connection to the grid that comes with that. Historically, we would just sell the power island and not try to get the balance of plants that would come from the ability to sell that whole capability and that’s a big growth opportunity for us that I’ll go through in more detail.
Then last one is around software. GE is been investing very heavily in software. We have a software-COE with a couple of thousand people in it in San Ramon, California. All of the GE businesses tap into that for their own software businesses. In our case, we’ve got a $250 million software business that services the utility industry that I already mentioned. Very high margin high growth business for us, but we’re pulling in user interface capabilities from the software COE, so it allows us to really take advantage of the benefits of a big GE.
Little bit deeper on the GE4GE initiative. This is a multibillion dollar opportunity for Energy Management to really partner. You see some examples on the left hand side there, whether it’s in Thermal, Distributed Power, Oil & Gas. Historically, we would sell the equipment or the power island. Tomorrow and today, we’re really focused on not only selling the power equipment but also selling the electrical equipment that goes with that, the balance of plant. And you can see the pipeline that we have in partnering with the other GE businesses to really drive Energy Management’s electrical content into these capabilities which is really quite attractive. In this case a $1.6 billion pipeline.
After the Alstom acquisition, which we hope to complete later this summer, this EBoP kind of capability doubles. There is a lot more opportunity for us to partner not only with the GE businesses but also the Alstom businesses that will come in.
Here on the GE2GE side, this is really expanding Energy Management content inside of GE, whether it is switch gear, driven systems, controls inside of the portfolio. You can see, last year, we did about $600 million of internal business out of our $7.3 billion. We expect to grow that in 2015 and beyond. And this is a big growth opportunity for us in make/buy. We’ve got a very detailed pipeline in working with the GE businesses in order to grow our internal capabilities. And this also grows with the Alstom acquisition. There is more GE content capabilities internally that are quite attractive to our growth going forward.
On the growth side, I also wanted to spike out our growing presence in the marine industry. If you go back four, five years ago, GE didn’t play very big in Marine. We sold some aeroderivative motors into the Marine space. We really changed our market position in Marine through the Converteam acquisition, which is now what we call Power Conversion, where we’re selling electric motors into the Marine space.
Cruise ships today, navy destroyers, LNG carriers, drill ships are all powered by electric motors as you know, whether it’s in the positioning equipment or in the actual propulsion equipment, and also the drives and controls that go with that. This is a fast growing space for us. You can see in our orders, we expect to be up almost 60% in 2015. This is a big space that we expect we can grow into. It’s about a $12 billion marketplace, as you can see, we’re only going to get $750 million or so of orders today. So we see big growth potential in here and we’re investing to make sure our capabilities are quite strong in this Marine space.
And this is another area where we’re partnering with the other GE businesses in order to both pull through other businesses when we have a lead in a Marine opportunity where we’re providing the propulsion equipment on a drill ship and bring other GE content in there or vice-versa when one of the other GE businesses is the lead.
Like all the GE businesses, we had a big focus on costs, you probably heard over the last couple of years, our initiative that we called, Simplification. But it really was truly focused on our SG&A or overhead cost in really simplifying our structure and really taking a lot of the complexity out and costs out. You could see in the top left, our SG&A has been coming down quite positively, 200 basis points over the last couple of years.
We expect that to continue from some of the initiatives we have underway, which I’ll talk about. We’ve reduced the number of product line kind of businesses we have that take structure out. If you’ve got 38 product lines, you’ve got 38 CFOs, 38 infrastructures. We’re going down to 11, that takes a lot of cost out of it.
On the ERP side, we haven’t invested enough historically. We are now in going to really simplify our information technology infrastructure to run our businesses, going from 50 ERP just in Energy Management, down to five. We’ve invested $100 million in that ERP roll out last year. We’ll do close to another $100 million this year as we get out to 17, that will be behind us, that ERP focus and that’s really going to drive a lot of our cost improvement going forward.
We’re taking a bunch of resources out in 2014, about 2000 going out. We’ll take out another 2000 or so this year. A lot of that restructuring is in flight, meaning the benefits are coming as the restructuring is completed in 2015 and 2016 and 2017. And we’re doing some additional restructuring. Just in the first quarter, we did another $3 million of restructuring inside of Energy Management and we’re due close to 50 to 60 additional restructuring in 2015 as we work to improve our cost structure.
We’re also consolidating our plants. I’ll talk a bit more about that, but there’s opportunities to get real scale in taking two plants that maybe weren’t at full capacity and putting them together in one and really getting the efficiency to come from that you can see going from 76 to 45 plants over the next couple of years.
And we’re also focusing on improving our supplier base. We just had too many suppliers that really add a lot of cost into the system for qualifying products and managing that infrastructure and you can see a big reduction there. So a big initiative at GE, you’ve read a lot about the billion plus benefits that came from simplification across all of GE last year. This is an initiative that continues in 2015 and 2016 and 2017, but there’s real tailwind in Energy Management from the work we did last year and that we’re doing this year, that’s going to bring benefits this year, next year and into 2017.
We’re also focused on our gross margin, really inside of our full value chain. You can see on the left hand side, some of our plants, some of the 50 plus plants that we have around the world of where we’re applying lean manufacturing processes as well as some of the restructuring to consolidate into single facilities. We get big leverage when you do that, you can see our gross margin rate improving over the last couple of years and we expect that to continue. That’s going to be driven by the sourcing execution that I talked about whether it’s driving direct material or cost out or improved supplier negotiations. The restructuring $170 million of incremental savings in flight coming forward and that will continue in 2015 and 2016. A big focus on projects to drive our labor and manufacturing costs, and that includes moving manufacturing to lower cost locations, whether it’s from a plant, it’s very high cost in a portion of the United States to another section of the United States, it’s going to give us a lower labor cost, but also the consolidation that comes with it.
And then all the GE tools that you probably heard about at our GE Analyst Meetings, whether it should cost or brilliant factories and analytics. And brining also that SG&A cost benefit that I talked about earlier on simplification, where we’ve really been very focused on taking our overhead costs out, taking that same discipline into our operating costs, and really driving some margin improvements. So this is a topic you will hear more about from GE going forward, and it’s a big initiative, not only in Energy Management, but across the rest of GE.
A couple of quick pages on the Alstom Grid acquisition. As you know, we announced that a little bit less than a year ago, the Alstom acquisition. There’s really two pieces to it, there is the power and renewable side that will go to the GE Power business. And then the Grid side is going to come to Energy Management. The Alstom Grid business is about $5 billion of revenue, that will marry in with our Digital Energy business, that’s a $1.4 billion. They’re in the same product space, but the Alstom Grid business really expands our capabilities in a very strong way.
And we’re going to call it GE Grid Solutions, but you can see that really will expand our capabilities in the ultra-high voltage and high voltage space. That’s going to give us the ability to partner with the GE businesses even more effectively on some of that balance of plant, where we didn’t have a full product set. We will have that following the Alstom acquisition. And then on the Industrial Solutions and Power Conversion side really operating in the power supplies base.
One of the other synergies that’s going to be available to us now is today Alstom Grid, when they’re going to do a project, does not have the low voltage products that we have in industrial solution, they’ve got a source that from some other competitors, tomorrow that will be a part of the GE portfolio. So just have a broader capability to service some of that balance of plant.
Here is a chart that just look that what is it look like putting our $1.4 billion Digital Energy business together with a $5 billion Alstom Grid business. We’ll have a much stronger market position than we have today. You can see what it’ll do to our revenue as we look out, we see a strong revenue growth going forward, and then synergies, both on the growth, as well as significant synergies on the costs side.
What do we like about it, I already mentioned they really completes our transmission and distribution offering. We on the GE side had some real product gaps, particularly in the high voltage and ultra-high voltage space with Alstom that really brings us together. And then quite important is the ability to bring our low voltage products into some of those projects that are available that today Alstom Grid doesn’t have.
The scale is going to be quite attractive for us, inside it is ultra-high and high voltage space. The project is a new area for us. They have $2 billion project business. Historically, GE in the Energy Management side sells just product. We don’t do as many turnkey products - projects. In our $7.3 billion of revenue last year, we had about $400 million project business, where we’re doing substations on a turnkey basis. Alstom Grid has $2 billion business, so a lot more capabilities there. They’ve got a software business serving utilities. We do to combine that will be $500 million software business, so a lot of synergies and growth there.
On the Substation Grid Automation, Protection & Control business, we have sister businesses in Alstom Grid and in GE that combined will be an $800 million, high growth, higher margin business. And then as I mentioned, there is another $500 million to $1 billion worth of GE opportunities when we put the businesses together. The other thing attractive is the global footprint. GE and the Digital Energy space is strong in North America. Alstrom Grid is a bit weaker there, and they are much stronger outside the United States. So they’ve got strong market positions in the Middle East, in India, in Europe that we don’t have in this high voltage, medium voltage space.
I already mentioned project capabilities, they have $7 billion backlog today that will come in, they will execute. And we’re extremely excited about the cost synergies. We’ve got very detailed integration teams working on it. I think the best line is, we like the Alstom Grid acquisition more today than we get a year ago when we announced it after we spent time really looking at what the opportunities are going forward.
And then the growth synergies are quite real, both, I’m putting the two businesses together, where we’re going to have broader capabilities to serve their customers. But then also the connection with GE, both the GE2GE, where we’re going to be selling product in the GE, but even more importantly, the multi-billion dollar opportunity. We think we have to partner with the Power business, our Wind business, our Distributed Power business, our Oil and Gas business to bring those high voltage products out to the marketplace and really expand our capabilities.
The last slide to wrap up of, where this is all taking Energy Management. Energy Management has been an underperforming business inside of GE. You might argue that it’s in a turnaround which is one of the phrases I use with my team of what we’re working on. If you go back a year ago first quarter last year, the business broke even, which is a really quite challenging.
In the fourth quarter we made $130 million of operating profit. Good progress, more in the fourth quarter last year than we made in 2013, we ended up with $246 million of operating profit are up 2X, 3.4% pre-tax margins. But as you recall still well below where our competitors are, which is where we’re heading. Our real focus is to get ourselves from this 3.4% towards that margins in the teens, and we think we’ve got a lot of tailwind that takes us there.
The market trends are attractive to us, which is why we like the space. When you look at Energy Management post the Alstom acquisition we’ll go from $7.3 billion business, that’s a close to $13 billion. So we’re going to be a bigger player in this attractive fundamental market for us. We’re really focused on improving our margins. There is more to do with the similar tailwind than what we’re doing. The headcount reductions that I talked about on the SG&A side taking out significant structure and simplifying our business, give us a real tailwind in the 2015, 2016 and 2017. As we continued at the plant consolidations that we started in 2014, we’ll continue in 2015 into 2016 are quite attractive. The ERP investments are going to simplify our business and allow us to take more cost and structure out better execution.
And then the other one that if you follow GE you know, that we have pretty dramatically enhanced or revamped our incentive process, how we measure our business leaders financially. And really linked the business performance to how we’re paid and you might argue wasn’t that how you were incentivized in the past and it was yes or no, but it’s really quite deliberate and clear now. But the Energy Management goals around revenue growth, operating margin growth, margin enhancement, and cash generation are really how me and my team are paid today, and that’s the same with all the GE business and that’s a change that just went effect in January. And we believe it’s really going to engage our team, even more tightly around what you want of driving margins and cash inside of the business.
The product investments we’re going to make, the greater example I showed you where our margins are going to go up, our costs are going down on that product, your investments in there. Those are tailwinds that are going to help us drive this kind of margin growth going forward. That connection with GE is really another big growth driver for us, whether it’s partnering on the balance of plant, the GE4GE, or selling more GE content into some of the GE businesses on controls and switchgear and some of the other motor controls is a big opportunity.
And then the couple of pages I took you through on the Alstom Grid acquisition. We think it’s a highly complementary acquisition to our high voltage business Digital Energy, but it’s also highly complementary to the rest of the Energy Management portfolio. And then it’s also gives us some real leverage in connecting with the rest of GE and driving our margins going forward. So our goal in the business is really to get our margins up to where our competitors are. We’re going to make a step in 2015. We’ll make another step in 2016, but we’ve got clear sights, as well as tailwinds we think behind us, it give us a real path to improving the margins inside of the business.
So that’s the last slide I had Andrew, and happy to take some questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Andrew Obin
Sure. So I think the question I have [so, A, and to just] to understand this is not the first business you’re turning around inside GE, right? You’ve done it before.
Mark Begor
I’ve got a few of those, yes.
Andrew Obin
So I think it’s interesting that this is a business that used to be sort of the old GE, right, it’s a very historical business. And I think the issues that the business have sort of stands for a lot of issues that GE sort of have had for the past decade. And I think the turnaround process also shows the promise as to what can be accomplished. So can you go in deeper as to, why do we find ourselves to the business that sort of what’s the original GE being sort of like break-even? And at the same time, why do you think you can get to mid-teens and how - what are the cultural changes doing business that are really driving it?
Mark Begor
Yes, thanks. It - I’ve been around GE a long time, and as you mentioned, I’ve done a number of turnarounds and a couple of capital businesses, most recently the commercial real estate business. If you follow GE, you know, it was losing a lot of money, it’s now back to profitable, I did that over the last three years. A year ago I asked to come in by Jeff Immelt, our Chairman, and really try to do the same thing here. And it really is a matter of focus and execution.
And this team really wasn’t - is focused on driving the bottom line than it should be. Energy Management was a business that if you go back to where it was four years ago, there was a big GE Energy business. They had our Power business, our Oil and Gas business, and Energy Management fitting in it. And Energy Management kind of fell to the bottom with a - as far as my view, as far as attention and focused. We weren’t investing enough in new products. We weren’t investing enough in our factories, you see the kind of factory consolidation that we’re doing. There wasn’t enough focus on the cost structure.
The business - the multiple P&Ls that we have and that simplification focus that we’ve been able to bring to the business is really driving a lot to the bottom line. Even the growth focus wasn’t what it should be. And we’re really energized about that partnering with the other GE businesses with a huge Power business that we have in the turbine renewable and wind business. Energy Management wasn’t as connective as it should be with those businesses to really drive our product into those customer solutions. And that’s a big opportunity going forward, and we’re starting to move the needle.
We’re pleased with the progress in 2014. You should expect that to continue in 2015 at a similar rate. You said mid-teens, I would like to get the teens further, but our focus and our plan is to get to not only to competitor margins, but above.
Andrew Obin
All right.
Mark Begor
If you look at the rest of the GE portfolio, every GE business outside of Energy Management operates at above competitor margins. And with the right focus, applying the right attention, we think we can get there too.
Andrew Obin
So what about product, I think what we’ve seen recently, I think you had showcased up here. So H Frame, GE is doing quite well. If you look at the LEAP engine, if you look motor business compared to CAT [ph] you’re simply doing little bit better in terms of market share.
Mark Begor
Yes.
Andrew Obin
There really has been the few cycle of reinvestment inside of GE, where GE is final and now sort of getting ahead in terms of market share. Can you just talk to what has happened in terms of the product in…
Mark Begor
In Energy Management…
Andrew Obin
…in Energy Management and what has sort of caused you guys to reinvest and how far away are you guys to where you want to be?
Mark Begor
Yes. The - it’s clearly the business if you go back three, four years ago wasn’t getting the investment attention that should both in new products in the factories, improving our factories for efficiencies in information technology, having dozens and dozens of ERPs is very difficult to manage it at a lot of cost to the structure. So all of those are areas that we’re investing in - we’re investing heavily in new products. We’re investing in our factories. We’re investing in our information technology that all of those are going to drive margin growth. If you go just to the new product area, our breakers example is a great one.
Our current breaker design, which we were living off, it’s a design that’s close to 15 years old. During that 15-year period, our competitors refresh their product probably twice. And we’re fine we’re doing it. We should have done it maybe earlier. But the focus that we have to really take cost out of the breaker design that part count one are using the FastWorks process to bring that product to the marketplace in two years versus in historical four to five, which not only we did, but also our competitors still do today.
We think it’s really going to be an ability to be more efficient about our new product dollars. An area where we’re having some near-term success investing in products has really been our power conversion business. That’s one where it’s about a $12 billion market, where about $2 billion, so a lot of room to grow, very attractive margins, our competitors in high teens there in the Power Conversion space. So we’ve been investing in rotating machines, our motors, our generators, as well as our power electronics that manage the rotating machines and also a service into that space.
And we’re really picking up we think some share there. That’s a place where we’re growing and it’s reflected in the fact that our growth rates are much higher in the market. We’ve been growing in multiples of the market over the last couple of years. We’ve been adding to our backlog. The last two years we expect to do that again in Power Conversion in 2015, and it’s been like Marine and others. We’re really winning big in the Power Conversion space.
Andrew Obin
[And to conclude just part of your] [ph] question, but can you take us around the world and just tell us what are you seeing in the first quarter in terms of business, in terms of trends?
Mark Begor
Yes, sure. It’s a similar way you heard this morning from Honeywell and Siemens. U.S. is a quite solid for us, and it actually made it bit stronger than we thought, we look at the fourth quarter. I would say, Europe is a mixed bag. There are areas where we’re having some real success areas that are still lagging a bit, but Europe is still, I would say, challenged as a - from a market standpoint. The emerging markets, particularly where we’re piggy back off of the other GE businesses and a lot of the product we sell in. At GE business that’s selling in a Distributed Power turbine, and we’re bringing the electrical equipment in is very high growth. We have, our GE is winning there. If you’re close to following GE in the emerging markets and Energy Management, it’s really taking advantage of that. So Middle East, Africa, a lot of the other emerging markets we’re seeing some very attractive growth.
Andrew Obin
How would you see sort of the FX will drive Japanese and European players and in terms of the pricing dynamic in your business?
Mark Begor
Yes. We have the big European competitors that we play against. The good news is, we have a European manufacturing base, but it’s quite strong. It will become stronger, post the Alstom acquisition with the footprint they have. From a pricing standpoint, I wouldn’t say, we’ve seen them try to take advantage of versus the U.S. They have the same kind of global footprint. We have, so I would say, we’re kind of balance, the good news is we do have the footprint than we have in Europe to take advance of that.
Andrew Obin
And I think in the remaining time, I think you guys have a unique connection to this old Brilliant Factory initiative…
Mark Begor
Yes.
Andrew Obin
…inside of GE by the virtue of what you manufacture on the software you guys have, could you just talk a little bit about that?
Mark Begor
Yes. It’s one of the GE2GE connections that I talked a little about. We have both a software and a controls business, it’s focused in the industrial space. The software business is about $250 million, a little bit less than that, and the controls businesses is about $400 million. And as I mentioned, there is a GE play there, where we’re using it inside of GE factories or using it with customer’s factories, where we bring not only controls, but software into the manufacturing space around the Brilliant Factory. There is also a big play for us around the control, so really coming to a standard set of control products inside of GE, that are all going to be GE source.
Andrew Obin
All right.
Mark Begor
And we’re about halfway down the path of that…
Andrew Obin
And [when did those] [ph] product?
Mark Begor
That started about two, three years ago, where historically our Power business, our Oil business, even our Locomotive business, we buy controls from a lot of different suppliers.
Andrew Obin
All right.
Mark Begor
They do a lot of the same things. GE and Energy Management had a business doing it too selling primarily, externally. And we really invested some new product introduction dollars around making sure, we had the right set of products that could supply, not only externally, but also internally. And by growing the scale of the business, it gives us more scale to continue to invest in those products to really drive the volume, not only internally, but externally.
Andrew Obin
And you’re going to be closer to 100% versus 50% where you are?
Mark Begor
Yes. When we look forward, it keeps moving up.
Andrew Obin
All right.
Mark Begor
You pick up 1,000 basis points of internal kind of margin - of share growth over an annual basis. So you get out to 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, you’ll start getting towards full entitlement inside of the GE side, but again that also gives us a stronger product suite to sell externally.
Andrew Obin
Sure. Well, we’re out of time. Thank you so much.
Mark Begor
Thanks.
