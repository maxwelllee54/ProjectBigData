Moms' Mobile Shopping Skyrocketed in 2012
Although moms may regulate cellphone use for their kids, they definitely love spending one-on-one time with their own smartphones.
An infographic from pregnancy app BabyBump shows that 93% of moms spent more time shopping on their cellphone in 2012 than in 2011, while 34% did more than half their shopping from their mobile device last year.
When it comes to what they bought, moms relied heavily on input and recommendations from other moms (58%). 
And why shouldn't they turn to their smartphones? We've seen dozens of studies that suggest smartphones make parenting easier by lowering back-to-school stress to keeping parents organized and even acting as emergency kits. 
More than 1,300 people were interviewed for this survey.
