Thanks for joining us on the web today. It's Keith Bachman here, we're happy to have Xerox. I think the first thing we're going to do is a FD disclosure and then we're going to have the panelists introduce themselves. So maybe we'll do the FD firstly.
During this meeting, Xerox executives may make comments that contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. These statements reflect management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially.
Information concerning these factors is included in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We do not intend to update these forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.
Alright great, maybe we'll start and swing around, Dave if you want to introduce yourself and what business you are in charge of and then we'll just roll left.
Dave Amoriell
Thank you, Keith. So I'm Dave Amoriell, I have responsibility for the government transportation business. I joined ACS about five years ago, it'd be five years ago in January to run the transportation business. Prior to that I spent 25 years with a large services firm always in the government sector, so my background has been large complex services endeavors mostly application installment, systems integrations of BPO, sort have been with ACS Xerox for five years.
The responsibility under government transportation really breaks down into the federal government. It’s a business we kind of got back into in 2009, it was a business back in 2003 we had swapped the state business with Lockheed Martin for the federal business which really seeded a lot of our healthcare and transportation business, so we’ve been back in 2009 and it’s on a goodwill trajectory, I think it’s a very good business where very small in that business in a very large market, but very bullish on that one.
We also have state government business. To give you a flavor of what’s in the state government business, we do child support services. So payments to -- the child support payments we process those in various states where that is required. We do a lot of electronic benefit transfer processing. So for self security recipients particularly the unbanked right it’s really being able to provide a debit card, an open loop debit card to a young bank so they can get their benefits each and every month.
We have some select ITO that we do there for some very large cities at state level. And we also do a lot of our classic commercial BPO creating a paperless environment imaging and scanning and so forth. The third biggest piece of this is transportation. It’s probably the most mature of the three, kind of in the transportation business it’s very much a global business. We’ve been in 43 different countries there. Very mature both in Europe and U.S., but it’s around tolling, what we call fair collection of fleet management, so what’s mass transit, bus rail, trains and that kind of activity, it’s photo enforcement, red light, speed cameras, it’s on-street not free parking and in the trucking industry both in the commercial side and on the government side we are doing the commercial trucking.
Keith Bachman
Okay, fair enough.
Jeff Jacobson
My name is Jeff Jacobson. I am the President of Global Graphic Communications. I have been in the graphic communications industry for almost 27 years. Previous to coming to Xerox, for five years, I was the Chief Executive Officer of Kodak Polychrome Graphics which was a 50-50 joint venture with Sun Chemical which is the largest graphic cards ink producer in the industry in Kodak, back in the days when Kodak was about a $16 billion company. They were my other shareholder in 2004, in the 2004 they bought out Sun Chemical and then I ran Kodak Graphics which was a $3.6 billion division until 2007, and then I was the Chairman and CEO of a small cap company called Presstek until I joined Xerox in February of 2012.
So I am responsible for the Global Graphic Communications. So if you think of commercial print, high-end printing, everything from transactional printing where we helve a lot of our cut sheet black-and-white devices to 75 sheets per minute color devices. And then also very high quality devices for printing for photo as an example such as Shutterfly for example, would be one of our customers. So at this time a year when you order a lot of products, it’s probably coming off with one of our devices.
And then more recently in the last couple of years, we’ve gotten into some really high-speed, high-end production inject devices which we will talk about later.
Keith Bachman
Okay. And then on the very right, certainly not least is Mr. Jim Lesko who runs IR, I think most of you know. Dave, we will start with you, the perspective that you guys have heard me talk about Xerox are certainly concerns around top-line growth, so we are going to frame our questions around distilling that out a bit. And I wanted to hear a little bit about at Analyst Day, if I look on your slide deck I think your bucket is $12 billion and you’re about 17% of services.
And if I am not mistaken at Analyst Day it was suggested that the market is growing at 4%. I am not sure if that’s what you’re growing at or you’re growing better, so I would like to clarify that? And then specifically let’s -- if you could call out some of the areas that you think are driving the growth in your category and is that sustainable?
Question-and-Answer Session
Dave Amoriell
So I mean the market itself is growing around 4.5%, and that’s how the global basis is which pretty much reclaims a global market. In 2013 we will come in mid single-digits so at or just better than the markets, so that’s the kind of set perspective.
And if I take a look it down, particularly in the transportation side, the growth trends for us, and it really varies by market. But if I look at the tolling industry today technology is now shifting to more what they call all-electronic tolling where you can get rid of the toll booths and get rid of the transponders and you have the ability to drive highway speeds, collect a license plate, do the account reconciliation out of the financial distribution. We are seeing that trend come down the pike and the interesting piece there is what differentiates us is our back-office.
We have a back-office offer we built over the last 20-25 year processes with millions of transactions a day, right it did pretty much as technology agnostic from the front-end so we really think we have taken that technology in being able to drive that beyond the shores of the U.S. to where we have some of the business.
Another big part of our business is what we call fair collection of fleet management I mentioned earlier. But it’s all the technology that goes around the buses and the trains and the trams. The heart of that business really got formulated from a Company called Asdon we purchased in 2005. A European company with R&D centers out of both France and Switzerland, the deal there has been able to take that into the U.S. We’ve got major programs in at least, in Asia-Pacific.
So, really the focus around the growth areas there is the technology in U.S. is shifting to what we call open payment systems to build and use your Visa, MasterCard, whatever, to be able to right off multi-transportation versus the dedicated smart coder ticket processing. So we see that wave coming in and we have a major project underway there.
And including the other thing that we see, we’re very mature in both Europe and the U.S. market in that business. The idea there is to continue to grow in the mid single-digit range there, but well we see a lot of growth opportunities in the emerging markets; namely, Latin America, Asia-Pacific we’ve made selective investments in both of those regions in the last couple of years. And we’re starting to see some nice wins there. We had a recent win in Malaysia several quarters ago. So the idea there is to win those deals they’ll execute in our commitments and I really believe that that…
Keith Bachman
What’s your mix U.S., other I will -- I don’t know if you have any perspective on just ballpark, it doesn’t need to be precise?
Dave Amoriell
No, if I look at the transportation side we’re probably certainly double-digits on the percentages in terms of the double-digits that’s outside the U.S. in terms of the overall revenue.
Keith Bachman
But certainly I mean certainly less than 50%?
Dave Amoriell
Yes, significantly less. Yes like 1% to 10% to 20% range. So I really do see a good growth opportunity there and most of that like I said most of that’s in Europe or in Canada so our growth regions really are the emerging economies.
Keith Bachman
Are you gated on that international growth in other words is it a people resource issue because it seems like that would almost be I don’t want to say unbridle opportunity, but it’s just would seem that that’s a tremendous opportunity.
Dave Amoriell
It is, I mean the beauty of it is that is the technology is very transformative. So the technology we put on a bus or a train or a tram is very transportable, language translation is not a big deal. So it really is around deciding what countries have the appetite to invest in new infrastructure and making sure you have the what I would call the sales coverage and the architects and the expertise in country to be able to articulate your value proposition and grow it. So that’s the beauty of that part of the business. It allows you to grow the business with reasonable investments in these countries.
Keith Bachman
Okay, and let’s continue down I want to stay in your bucket and just don’t get lonely over there. I want to continue on your growth rate. So we did kind of transport in the state governments, what’s the potential there?
Dave Amoriell
Well, we still see the state government as a growth area, as folks are probably aware with the economy bouncing back we’re starting to see some of the state budgets or the tax receipts coming in, so that’s a good thing for us. The other key part of what we do in a lot of state governments itself is self revenue generating so it isn’t depending upon discretionary spend. I would say the state governments probably at the lower-end of that 4.5% in terms of growth it’s more than 4% we’ve exceeded that in 2013 at the state government level.
I think the big opportunities for us I kind of mentioned it earlier, but it’s getting into this what we call open loop car processing and once again think of open loop as the ability to get a debit card and be able to use that at any store where a close loop is if I got from state that only can use it for food stamps. And so we’re seeing that market which is a very good market for us kind of level off, but we’re now starting to see is this the open loop or the ability to use your debit card and in fact starting to grow. So we see that as a major growth area. We’ve done well in with the ITO, the government side has been -- at the sell it’s been a good book of business for us and have grown book of business.
Keith Bachman
Okay, I’m going to come back to that ITO comment so that’s important but it -- so if you look at your 17 points of business that can grow mid single-digits over the next couple of years?
Dave Amoriell
Yes, I believe, absolutely.
Keith Bachman
Okay. Jeff, I don’t want you to get lonely we’re going to, we’re going to come back to the printing business, what we’re going to do is bounce back and forth revenues margins, et cetera. So talk a little bit about your growth potential if you aggregate the market that you serve. What does that look like obviously I understand the starting point is investors assume it is dead, so let’s work from there?
Jeff Jacobson
Maybe that’s why they haven’t been in this industry for 27 years as I mentioned they ran a small cap printing company and many of my investors who were not in printing would ask me the same question, is print dead, what about all these iPad’s what about electronic devices. And I said we’re in this for the pockets that are growing. If you look at this industry basically it’s about a $6 billion market we have that $4 billion of the $6 billion is in color.
So color is growing at 9% compounded annually through about 2016. When you look at inkjet what I talked about before, you’re looking at about 20% to 22% compounded annual growth, so there is no question if you want to say transactional blank-and-white printing is declining, double-digits 12%-13% absolutely but when you look at color pages that are three times the value of black-and-white pages or mono-pages and you look at the growth that will come in production color where we have the market lead today in terms of market share and you look at the investments we’re making in inkjet and then that market is going to grow 20 plus percent. I feel great about it.
When you then look at the market from a page volume standpoint, there are 50 trillion pages printed per year, only 2% today are digital, so1 trillion pages, so we’re in this for it and what we are driving for everyday is how we’re going to take the vast majority of those 49 trillion pages and have them come to Xerox devices. We would expect over the next 10 years give or take the market will have about 10 trillion of those 49 trillion pages moving to the industry, right. And it’s our job to grab as many of those pages as we can.
Keith Bachman
Okay, maybe touch a little bit up on the competitive landscape and where Xerox sees, it’s competitive advantage or disadvantage to be fair I mean, I would summit I know Ursula disagrees with me on this that you guys are behind on inkjet and she strongly disagrees, but talk a little bit about where you guys see your strengths and weaknesses?
Jeff Jacobson
Yes, I mean, I will address the inkjet question as I remember you asked at the investor conference, so.
Keith Bachman
Yes, nicely done.
Jeff Jacobson
Yes very nicely. So where we are is we have the broadest portfolio in the industry. When I look at the printing business, I want to my customers to be able to print everything from true one-to-one personalization if that needs one page to millions of impressions which is where traditional offset printing goes today. And I would not want to be in traditional offset printing, but inkjet will be able to do. As good as xerography is and as great as the quality is you just can’t take xerography and get into the multimillion runs at the same cost point that our customers need. So when you look at our blank-and-white where we have over 50% market share, you look at our high-end production color where we have leading market shares.
We have the broadest portfolio in this industry, so now when you couple that with the service, the channel that we have, the service organization we have, the workflow and software and then the finishing, I don’t think there is another company in the industry certainly from a cut sheet digital standpoint that has what we have. And quite frankly I would go to with my feet because that’s why I came here 22 months ago.
Then I recognized at the same time and Xerox was already ending chip with CiPress which is our solid ink borderless technology yet, but there is no question customers were saying we would like Aqueous too, which is where some of major competitors where. And by definition if we’re not as effective on inkjet as we were in xerography, we are losing market share which we don’t want to do.
So with regards to your question Keith when we are late to the game, that's the analogy I give my team is, we got caught in a little bit of traffic and we got to the first inning of the baseball game just as they were planning the national anthem, it’s probably the way I would classify it. You don’t want to get into this too early because we got in it deeply two years ago. It would have been a lot of R&D dollar spent without a market ready to purchase.
So we just made a major or made an acquisition of a company really look at more as a research and development investment for us called Impika where for two years basically we were distributing our product in Europe. We acquired them in February and now what we feel is that we have a portfolio that gets us right in the game that goes very much alongside our cut sheet xerographic portfolio.
Keith Bachman
So how do you think about you are down on black-and-white probably for perpetuity I would think or maybe that’s flattened out sometime, don’t know, plus you’ve got color and then you’re selling, trying to ramp up inkjet, how do you think about the collective opportunity if you aggregated all those pieces?
Jeff Jacobson
I feel very good about it.
Keith Bachman
I was trying to get a number?
Jeff Jacobson
Well if you look at this way and you say the market now is $4 billion color, $2 billion black-and-white and we should see about $1.6 billion of growth in the market over the next three to four years of which 1.3 billion of that will be inkjet and the remaining 300 will be production color. So we’re going to have to make sure that we gain the appropriate shares to grow our business the way we need to.
Keith Bachman
Okay right. I want to come back to something you referenced it’s a broader Xerox question that I have but how important is ITO to your business?
Dave Amoriell
I mean for my business I use the ITO in one or two ways, one is in many cases will be part of my solutions that I’m selling to my clients, so if I have a hosted solution where I’m running a back-office operation.
Keith Bachman
Let me just interject ITO information technology business portion of Xerox, so you’re in the BPO world mostly and so you’re using a different part of Xerox, so…
Dave Amoriell
I am sorry about that yes so. We will leverage our ITO colleagues to provide the hosting capability from many of my operations. So if we do that that certainly is a benefit, and also in many cases the way we go-to-market in the government side is since we know the clients and we’re selling other elements to that client we also will drag through our ITO offerings also. So in some of the large cities in the various states we have done just that right we have brought an ITO to bear as an ITO offering for the states. And so we'd spend a growth part of my portfolio right, it certainly has given me more customer connections with those customers to sell other parts of the portfolio.
Keith Bachman
And how do you think about the competitive landscape, we didn't just get into specific companies on for jet but who are you competing against on a day-to-day basis?
Dave Amoriell
So, if you look at my business it’s while there is no in all seriousness there is no one competitor across my space, so if you kind of break it down a level. In the federal space it’s, the classic federal integrator CSC, General Dynamics with the acquisition of Evangent, right, Circos. And we tend to see them they tend to be more BPO oriented.
In the state government business, and then we'll see a Unisys quite a bit, when we see an IBM every once in a while given the kind of stuff that we do. And in the transportation business it really is very much it varies by the market so if I am in my tolling market it’s a TransCore ETCC. In the US, it's Captch, if I am overseas. If it's in my public transit business it's cubic domestically and it's, Dallas Refine, Bachman overseas.
So one of the things we're trying to do as these technologies converge overtime and these multi-transitions converge overtime we have the benefit of playing in all those markets. And where the technology converges so that’s what could take advantage of that. But it really isn't key to anyone player across my patch?
Keith Bachman
If I think about the level of penetration is there a way to think about share and your market segments about where you have share, we talked a little bit about GOs so I was trying to -- I think we already established we have lot of growth opportunities in foreign markets, but are you bumping up against share, the state governments or here domestically and then where are the green -- the most near-term opportunities as you think about your international expansion?
Dave Amoriell
So if I take a look at it domestically first, so in the transportation side on the tolling side of the business today probably about 50% of the revenue generated through tolls transaction runs through our systems. But with the market -- so we have got a very large market share on the tolling side today. Particularly in the Northeast with E-ZPass, out in -- on the West Coast in San Francisco and we have systems in Florida and in the Carolinas. So really the growth expansion for that market is and we did that recently we had a nice win in Texas about a quarter ago so it's really expanding there in Texas.
But there the opportunity for us is Europe, because the back-office really is agnostic to the technology whether using transponders here or GPRS also in Europe. So there is opportunities there, especially there on the tolling side, so hopefully that gives a flavor of the growth opportunities on that one to get on the transit side the fair collection and fleet management. To me that's more of the technology play going to open systems we are already in most countries today, I do see growth opportunities particularly in Asia-Pacific and Latin America because we're still building out new bus lanes, new rail lanes, new transits so I see growth opportunities there.
So really is a combination of both technology plays domestically, I mean another good examples on the tolling side the concept of what they call HOT lanes high occupancy vehicle lanes. So in the city of LA we want to over a year ago where they took their HOV lanes and they called one off to be a high occupancy toll lanes where an individual can pay to get into that lane. So we put the technology in and we run those operations and as long as we're maintaining a certain minimum speed there is certain charges that go with it.
We see the growth of that, so really tells us around advancing the technologies domestically whether it’s open road tolling, high occupancy toll lanes or doing it geographically.
Keith Bachman
Jeff switching gears to you how important is the yen to you and how are you using that and a different way to say that is how do you balance pricing and margin in your business?
Jeff Jacobson
I mean the market will determine the price for us, so certainly we don't, we're one of the leaders so we try to establish the price at the same time we have to understand our competitors well enough and our customers well enough to see where the market is going. So from that standpoint it’s continually an analysis of how much volume are we getting and how much price should we give based on the deal. We want to make sure that we manage our margins very carefully. So as we go forward for example the beginning of inkjet, I would see in the industry inkjet margins, gross margins will probably be less than xerographic margins. The same time the volumes will be more over time. So we’ll be getting more gross profit dollars, perhaps a little less gross profit percentage. So, we’ll have to take our cost down to make sure there are bottom line in fact does grow. And that’s the analysis that we’re working on now and that’s how we’re running the business. At the same time we’re going to start with margins in inkjet and then based upon work we’re doing on inkjet heads, media substrate, inks we believe we’ll be able to get the margins to appoint post to xerography.
Keith Bachman
And you mentioned M&A before, maybe talk a little bit about the deal you’ve done. But as importantly I think investors -- don’t take this wrong way, but would rather see capital deployed towards services, broadly speaking. Do you guys have what you need?
Jeff Jacobson
For us now with that acquisition, I’m speaking now for the high end graphic communications as opposed for all technology, in this case specifically. We have what we need and then maybe it gets to your point Keith that what we laid to the game. What the Impika acquisition did do for us on inkjet, it enabled us to probably expedite we could have done internally on Aqueous Inkjet by two years.
So, we had what we needed on CiPress which was the waterless inkjet technology, but we knew we need to go on Aqueous. This was a company as I mentioned before that we knew well, we worked with them for two years. So this got us to where we needed to be, and now it’s all about execution as we go forward.
Keith Bachman
Dave, at least a portion of student loan falls under your area, right? I don’t know if some of it falls out of.
Dave Amoriell
Well, there is two pieces to loans. One is the commercial side which falls outside of me and then there is the actual work department of education for doing student loans, that goes to department to education that falls underneath me.
Keith Bachman
Jim maybe you want to kind of collectively answer this, but Xerox has given some indication about what student loan impact is in '13 and then also what the impact is on '14 that maybe I think the characterization was 25 basis points in margins and maybe a point of growth if I’m not mistaken. I think on investor’s perspective, that’s fine. But confidence level -- how do you know because I don’t think investors want to see it get worse.
Jim Lesko
I think David could speak to us specifically his area which is declining the fast as the other as a pretty predictable runoff, but David why don’t you speak…
Dave Amoriell
My side, we have direct student loans and the direct student loans also came up for recompleting about four, five years ago. We chose thought to re-compete for it, they were going to -- they were breaking the program up and really shipping after enough of profits because the technology suffers more commoditizing, rights? So we chose not to apply. Our portfolio started running off significantly this year. But the last of it rolled off the end of August. So that portfolio is done, sold off.
Keith Bachman
So it'd be hard to get worse of it's all.
Dave Amoriell
It can’t get worse, it’s gone, zero. What's the point. It's gone.
Jeff Jacobson
And this fourth quarter was probably the most significant compare we'll have. And then obviously this time next year the compare is significantly zero.
Keith Bachman
Jeff for you and then we’re going to do some margins. Just work flow, how important is work flow -- is it a meaningful part of R&D. How does it help in capture deals?
Jeff Jacobson
You just hit the nail in the head when you said capture deals. So, when I was running this almost $4 billion division, my work flow component was only 6% in revenue. But I would, I couldn’t measure how many accounts that I held because of that work flow. I look at it as the hearts, the brain of the operation. Many of our customers have multiple devices, some might have 15, 20 of our devices. If you can have a common work flow that can speak and connect with all their different devices and machines, that’s just, I hate to use the term that you’re locked in with your customers, But it's very difficult for somebody else to come in, you also automate their operations, you put in your color management, you color assurance to make sure if they're printing on one device and one building versus another device another building, that printed pages is coming off the same color. And that's different than controllers. You could have digital front end controllers and you could then have work flow feeding those controllers.
Keith Bachman
So your competitors have the same work flow that you have?
Jeff Jacobson
Not the same that we have, but some have similar functionality.
Keith Bachman
Is your work flow a competitive advantage or competitive charity?
Jeff Jacobson
No, we believe it’s a significant competitive advantage. Because of this things could do with color management automation. If you were to look at our iGen device which is what we use in our highest quality shops, so for example the Photo Market. We believe that’s a distinct advantage for us that we’re able to sell against our competitors in a way that’s difficult for them to compete and I think our customers -- or the competitors machine will them, will tell us that their productivity is typically up to 20% greater because of the automation of the workflow.
Keith Bachman
So, Dave there's two parts to your story on services. You guys got to hit your mid single digit revenue growth and margins, so what are you doing to improve your margins as you look out -- now I just measured and investor just measured the aggregate services bucket, so I'm not holding you accountable for all that, but you're a piece of it. Xerox has improved its margins by call it 50 basis points, just using a round number. So what are you doing to improve your margins and is headcount part of that in terms of lower cost headcount?
Dave Amoriell
So, the answer to your last question is a part of what of what we’re doing, right? So Lynn covered the five-plank strategy. I'll kind of localize it more to what we're doing. So, first one about portfolio management right, we are structuring our investments today and targeting our acquisitions around those businesses that in other markets growing and we have high operating margins, right? It's, very conscious focus. And we're looking at potential pieces of business to divest, both of those were active on my side, important part of the puzzle.
Second one is the cost restructuring which is talked quite a bit about in the investor's conference and being I have the government business, transportation business, you have to do it in selective areas. Clearly I build products, there's nothing preventing me from building products where it’s in our best interest to build on this. There's a lot of activity going on there. The third one I would say that's equally important as operational excellence right? So we put a conscious focus in place several years ago to make sure we execute on our commitment and that's a two part statement, make sure we're bidding deals right up front and then we’re executing them right in the middle, because that can damage you as much as the other two if you don’t do it. So that’s a very important focus in the organization.
You heard a little bit about the analytics being the other part of the plank, broaden that and bid into innovation, one of the, I think the damages particularly my business has had because we're so intellectual capital based a lot of software assets is leveraging Xerox research. So we've done a lot of that, we've deployed fair amount of things into our platform, some of them are analytics oriented which I think is differentiated but what that does for me, it allows me to demand a little higher premium on my assets, right, which helps drive my margins. So it's not doing the analytics for analytics sake, it’s doing the analytics part of my back platform solution that allows me to command a little bit higher operating margin.
And of course the last piece is global, right? And global kind of cuts through all of those, right, but when I'm going into new markets with a competition maybe not as stiff, I have the ability to just drive a different profit. So it literally Keith is all five of those, and all five are almost equally important in driving to our overall operating margins.
Keith Bachman
How is the conversation, Xerox -- a lot of companies, Xerox included, revenues versus margins, there's always trade off. And how do you try to balance that, what do you, are you measured on anyone more specifically are you trying to -- is there a bias one way or the other in terms of that chip.
Dave Amoriell
I mean certainly the focus is on growing profitable revenue, right, there's not a lot of appetite for growing revenue for revenue's sake in the organization. So you know our incentive structure incentivizes folks to grow profitable revenue and the more profitable it is the bigger the incentives are to drive that behavior accordingly.
Keith Bachman
And then maybe the final one from me, as I'm officially out of time. Just sticking on M&A, you know we didn't come back and close that loop, but is M&A an opportunity for you and I think by Xerox's own admission M&A has not been as fertile ground this year as it was hoped, and so what’s been the bottleneck in your mind?
Dave Amoriell
Well, you know first and foremost, we're not going to lower our standards in what we’re looking for in a company, we’ve been very-very-very selective. I will say over the last three four months we've put even more of a full-court press identifying candidates, I feel good about the pipeline. But obviously we got to see that pipeline through and clearly that focus is going to be around ideally given the geographic footprint if I can ideally. It's giving me something with a platform, whether it’s analytics platform or software platform. And probably lastly, but probably most importantly it's got to be something that's not dilutive to my business from an operating margin perspective. So, I would say the focus has certainly intensified, right, I feel as good about the pipeline as I did a year ago. But we still got to make sure they're good properties at the end of the day, they got to be good, they got to be good acquisitions.
Keith Bachman
I'm remiss in seeing if there's any question in the field. We'll do that quickly. Dan you're not allowed to ask a question, so you can sit down. Alright, well why don’t we, I think that's probably it gentlemen, but we certainly appreciate it. Best of luck to everybody as we all close out the year. Thank you very much.
