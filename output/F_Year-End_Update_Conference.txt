George Sharp
Good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you. Those who are joining us either live here in the room or by webcast, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning for our year end briefing. I am George Sharp with Investor Relations at Ford Motor Company. Presenting today is Bob Shanks, our CFO, and also participating in the call is Stuart Rowley, our Corporate Controller. We’ve made copies of this morning’s press release and slides available on our website for everyone to use them.
Today’s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance, of course, I'm sure you all recognize that actual results could be different, the most significant factors that could affect our actual results are summarized at the end of the presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.
So, with that, I will turn the presentation over to Bob.
Bob Shanks
Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming to spend time with us this morning and on behalf of my colleagues that are here today, as well as the team back at Ford we’d like to wish all of you the very best this holiday season.
We are here today to provide you with an update to our outlook for 2013 and to share our views on 2014. Our updates for 2013 will not change our prior full year outlook for total company results, but we will provide updates on recent events that affect both North America and South America.
In terms of next year, 2014 will be another solid year for Ford Motor Company as we continue to make substantial investments across the world and implement our ONE Ford Plan to deliver profitable growth for all.
There are several factors, however, that will affect various parts of our business next year and as a result, our financial performance as well, and we will cover those today. We will also share with you our latest assessment of our outlook for the mid-decade period.
But before proceeding just one point of clarification, next year we will begin reporting a new automotive business unit, Middle East and Africa, and our outlook for 2014 reflect this.
As we carve out Middle East and Africa there will be some reporting differences between 2013 and 2014 results for North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, South America is not affected. But we do not judge them to be significant. We will share the impact of the creation of Middle East and Africa on the affected business units sometime next year.
With that, let's turn to the next slide which very appropriately outlines our ONE Ford Plan. As always, the ONE Ford Plan shown here is the foundation for everything that we do in Ford.
Across the enterprise, we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at current demand and changing model mix, accelerate development of new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet and work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global assets.
Our commitment remains the same which is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles small, medium and large cars, utilities and trucks delivering profitable growth for all.
Although, this year is not quite over we’ve clearly made excellent progress towards our goal of profitably growing and serving customers all over the world with outstanding products and services. It’s worth noting a few of the accomplishments, so let’s turn now to slide two.
First, let’s talk about growth. We expect to achieve automotive revenue growth of about 10% this year. As a result of increases in global industry volumes and Ford market share, including record market share for China, as well as for Asia-Pacific/Africa. We also benefited to a lesser extent from higher dealer stocks mainly in North America to support higher sales this year and in 2014.
The company's growth was supported by strong products, including many launched across the world this year. With more exciting products to come such as the recently announced all-new Lincoln MKC utility and of course, the all-new Ford Mustang.
We also made significant progress this year in addressing structural issues across our business starting with Europe. Our Europe transformation plan focused on products, brand and cost efficiency made great strides. Our new products contributed to higher retail share of the retail industry in Europe in each of the past 10 months.
We also closed two U.K. plants in July and reached agreement to close our Genk, Belgium plant at the end of 2014, and we began to relocate vehicle production at our remaining facilities for better cost efficiency.
We also announced in May our plan to restructure our operations in Australia, exiting local manufacturing by October 2016, while expanding our product line up and customer service.
And finally, in August, we shared our comprehensive capital strategy with investors, one that’s targeted to contribute -- to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, while delivering high levels of shareholder value. Based on our business performance and improving balance sheet, we now are rated investment grade by four of the major rating agencies.
Let’s turn now to our 2013 outlook on slide three. This is a summary of our present planning assumptions in key metrics for 2013 compared with the plan that we shared at the beginning of the year. This year, we expect to deliver outstanding results, meeting or exceeding all operational and financial metrics shown here with the exception of quality which is mixed.
Our performance includes increasing our market share in the U.S. and China, and sustaining our market share in Europe, including improving our retail share of the European retail passenger car market and improving our share of the commercial vehicle market.
From of a financial point of view, we expect to deliver a total company pre-tax profit that’s higher than last year and one of the best full year results we will have achieved in more than a decade. We also expect automotive operating margin to exceed last year’s level.
Importantly, automotive operating related cash flow will be substantially higher than a year ago, more than likely setting a record. So at the company level, our outlook for 2013 remains unchanged with this year expected to be among the best in our history.
Let’s now recap on slide four, our outlook by business unit, as well as for automotive net interest expense and our operating tax rate, because there are a few changes. And these changes affect North and South America, as I mentioned earlier, and our operating tax rate.
And in case of North America, we remained on track to deliver a pre-tax profit that exceeds last year's $8.3 billion. We now expect, however, North America's operating margin to range from 9.5% to 10% lower than our prior guidance of about 10% mainly as a result of higher warranty expense of $250 million to $300 million associated primarily with the Escape 1.6 liter recall that we announced last month.
In the case of South America, we now expect full-year results to be about breakeven. Recent government actions in Venezuela, including price controls and a very limited and uneven supply of foreign currency to support production have affected production adversely as well as the business and overall results in the region. Please note the outlook of about breakeven assumes no official devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar before year-end.
Finally, we expect the company’s full-year operating effective tax rate to be about 27%, largely due to the fourth quarter reduction in Ford credit's tax liability that we mentioned in the third quarter earnings call. Consistent with these updates, we expect the company's 2013 full-year pre-tax profit to be about $8.5 billion.
Before moving on to talk about 2014, we’d like to touch on another area in which we also made substantial progress this year and that’s pensions. Because of the strategic actions that we've been taking along with increases in discount rates, we estimate that the underfunded status of our global pension plans at year-end 2013 will be reduced to about $10 billion, nearly cutting in half the gap that we had at the end of last year.
In addition, as the funded status of our funded plans improved during the year, we progressively increased the mix of fixed income assets in our plans portfolios toward our long-term target of 80% with the objective of reducing funded status volatility. At year-end 2013, for example, the fixed income mix in our U.S. plans is projected to be about 70% compared with the 55% that we saw at the end of 2012.
Another major de-risking strategy that we began in 2012 will be completed this quarter, our U.S. salaried retiree voluntary lump sum program. For the entire program, we made payments to about 35,000 people, or about 37% of those eligible and we settled $4.2 billion in obligations or about 25% of the related liability.
We also recognized special item charges for the program of about $850 million, reflecting the acceleration of unrecognized non-cash losses. Of that amount, $600 million was recognized in the first nine months of this year, with about $150 million occurring in the fourth quarter. The remainder was recognized in 2012.
Finally, including the impact of higher year-to-date asset returns, we now expects average annual cash contributions required to fully fund our funded plans over the next three years to be $1 billion to $2 billion per year, instead of the prior outlook of $2 billion to $3 billion per year.
I’ll now shift our attention to 2014, starting with the business environment on Slide 6. In general, the 2014 business environment suggests improving business conditions across many markets. After growing about 2% in 2013, we expect global GDP for 2014 to improve 2.5% to 3% based on leading economic indicators.
In addition, monetary policies remain supportive of improving economic activity, particularly in mature markets. In the U.S., economic growth is projected to be around 2.5% next year, supported by continued recovery in housing and business investment spending.
In South America, on the other hand, higher interest rates are resulting in slower growth in Brazil while the business environment of Venezuela and Argentina includes significant policy related risks. European economic indicators are showing signs of recovery in the growth rate in the 20 European markets, we now track is expected to rise above 1% next year.
In addition, policy officials continue to work toward banking union and fiscal reforms and monetary policy support will be critical in limiting deflation risk. In Asia-Pacific, growth for China is projected to be in the 7.5% range for 2014, supported by improving domestic and external demand while policymakers focus on structural reform and transitions.
In India, on the other hand, modest growth is projected in the 5% to 5.5% range as elections likely will produce more pro-growth policies. Overall, we expect global economic conditions next year to be supportive of higher automotive industry volumes.
Let’s now turn to Slide 7 in the principal areas of Focus at Ford as we look ahead to 2014. Next year, we’ll see an absolute continued focus on our One Ford plan to profitably grow our business for the benefit of all of our stakeholders and underpinning everything that we do is improving our quality across the business.
At the same time, next year will be a very active year with a large number of major product launches across the globe. We’ll also be working to sustain the strong business performance of North America and continuing our migration to a nearly 100% One Ford global product lineup in South America.
In the region, however, our teams also will be working to manage rising risks in Venezuela and to a lesser extent in Argentina. Europe is all about continuing our transformation plan and Asia-Pacific will be progressing our growth plans.
As mentioned earlier, our team responsible for Middle East and Africa will be launching the new business unit, leading our growth strategy for this rapidly growing part of the world. As Ford Credit, we continue to leverage the strategic benefits of this important part of our business in support of our automotive growth.
And finally, we continue to execute our capital strategy to finance our plan, further strengthened our balance sheet and provide attractive returns to our shareholders. This includes providing shareholders with a regular growing dividend that is sustainable over an economic or business cycle.
In 2014, we also have an anti-dilutive option beginning in November next year to terminate conversion rights and settle our outstanding 2016 convertible debt with cash instead of shares. Our fully diluted earnings per share at the end of the third quarter included 98 million shares associated with this 2016 convertible debt. At present prices, this would be the equivalent to a share repurchase program of about $1.7 billion.
Let’s now talk about several major factors that we expect to influence our performance next year. Slide 8 shows the number of all new and significantly refreshed products, we expect to launch globally and by region in 2014.
As you can see, we expect global launches to more than double those of 2013, and of those 23 launches, only eight have been announced to-date. You can also see that we expect North America to have more than three times the number of product launches next year as in 2013.
The launches in North America will cover a significant percentage of the regions ongoing volume. As result of the transition to new products, we expect wholesale volume next year to be lower than in 2013 in North America.
Net pricing to be slightly unfavorable as we run out prior models, and assume a continuation of a more competitive pricing environment for small and medium cars and utilities due to the weaker yen.
We also expect manufacturing, engineering and spending related costs in North America to increase next year due to the 2014 launches as well as for products and capacity actions that will be launched in later periods.
The payoff for North America from the 2014 launches and investments we incur next year for future periods will be a stronger product lineup and volume and revenue opportunities in 2015 and beyond. As a result, we expect pre-tax profit and operating margin in North America to be lower next year than in 2013.
The second factor impacting next year is Venezuela, which is the focus of Slide 9. But most of you are aware the environment in Venezuela is volatile and increasingly difficult and unpredictable for business. Venezuela is a protected market with the government controlled exchange rate used in measuring business results. Results therefore presently include the favorable effect of what is now an overvalued currency until such time as a major official devaluation would occur.
The most recent official devaluation occurred at the beginning of 2013 and had a substantially negative effect on our results in the region. For 2014 planning purposes, we are assuming a major devaluation will take place once again early in the year from 6.3 to 12 bolivars to the dollar, with an unfavorable profit effect of about $350 million. If and when this occurs, it will be reported in our operating results.
In addition to currency volatility, another major issue in Venezuela is access to foreign currency to pay for imported components used in vehicles we assembled there as well as for imported parts that support our after sales service business. Foreign currency access is controlled by the government and supply has been uneven and unpredictable for some time and recently availability has been very limited. As a result, we reduced production progressively in 2013 and we are assuming in 2014, very low levels of production.
Finally, the government recently began intervening directly in business, including establishing for the auto industry, prices for service parts sold to dealers. These prices are below normal margins. We believe there is a risk that the government will take the same approach for new vehicle prices, but this has not explicitly been included in our planning assumptions for next year.
Although, we expect the One Ford Plan to drive improved profitability in Brazil and Argentina in 2014, particularly as customers continued to respond well to our new products. We expect this to be offset by deterioration in Venezuela. As a consequence, results for the region should be about the same as in 2013. There are risks to this outlook, given the volatility of the situation in Venezuela and increasing risks in Argentina. And we will keep you informed of developments affecting our business in South America and in these markets as 2014 progresses.
The next factor to highlight here on Slide 10 is Europe and our transformation plan. As noted earlier, our European transformation plan remains on track to deliver better results in 2014 and to achieve profitability in 2015. Next year, the Genk facility will close at year-end, significantly contributing to an 18% reduction in our capacity in Europe excluding Russia, and generating savings in 2015 and beyond.
During the year, however, we expect to incur restructuring costs of about $400 million related primarily to accelerated depreciation of plant assets and product relocations. These costs will be reported in Europe's operating results as they have been in 2013. In addition, we'll incur higher launch and engineering cost during the year as we bring more new products to market in 2014 than we did in 2013.
And plan for even more new products, consistent with our announced plan to add at least 25 new products in five years. And although not reported in operating results, we expect special item charges in Europe next year to total $400 million to $500 million, mainly related to personnel separations. In summary, the Europe transformation plan is progressing very well with better results projected for 2014 and on track to achieve profitability in 2015.
Let’s now talk about Asia Pacific on Slide 11. Our operations in Asia Pacific have been undergoing a transformation over several years as we've invested consistently for growth on our own such as in Thailand and India and with partners in our unconsolidated joint ventures in China. Our actions have resulted in strong growth, including record market share this year as well as a profitable business, including what we would expect to be a record of full year results in 2013.
In 2014, we’ll continue to execute our growth strategy for the region. As shown here, the company has six major facilities under construction across the region, with the two facilities in China starting production next year and two more in 2015. In India, the two facilities now being built also will start production in 2015.
Next year, we expect pre-tax profit in Asia Pacific to be about the same as in 2013, which reflects three factors. First, continued increase in investments to support growth in 2014 and beyond. Secondly, a slower rate of growth in revenue and volume than a year ago due to production constraints with some of our products and a more competitive pricing environment, including the impact in some markets of the weaker yen, and finally unfavorable results in Australia as we restructure the business and reflect the effects of a weakening Australian dollar. We remain on track for Asia Pacific to be a growing and significant contributor to Ford's results over the next few years.
Let’s now recap what all of this means for each of our business units. Here on Slide 12, you can see the 2014 outlook for each of our automotive business units as well as automotive net interest expense and Ford Credit. First, we expect North America to remain strongly profitable but at a lower rate than in 2013, with an operating margin ranging from 8% to 9%, which is consistent with our targeted ongoing range of 8% to 10%.
In South America, results are expected to be about equal to 2013, but with risks in Venezuela and Argentina. In Europe, we expect reduced losses, including restructuring costs of about $400 million that will be reported in operating results.
In Asia-Pacific, we expect pre-tax profit to be about the same as in 2013. Automotive net interest expense is also expected to be about the same as this year, but we are not assuming a repeat of this year’s favorable fair market adjustments on our investment in Mazda.
Ford Credit is expected to perform well next year with profit about equal to this year. Growth should offset the continued normalization of credit losses, the continued run-off of higher-yielding assets and the impact of our strategy to unencumber our balance sheet to build a stronger investment-grade company. Finally, we expect our new Middle East and Africa business unit to approach breakeven results.
Now, let's look at what this means for the total company on slide 13. For 2014, we project U.S. industry volume, including medium-heavy trucks to range from 16 million to 17 million units. In Europe, we expect to range a 13.5 million to 14.5 million units and in China we expect volume to range from 22.5 million to 24.5 million units.
For our financial metrics which have been revised to align to the key drivers of total shareholder return, we expect automotive revenue to be about the same as 2013; automotive operating margin to be lower, automotive operating related cash flow to be positive but substantially lower than 2013, including higher capital spending consistent with our mid-decade outlook of about $7.5 billion.
We expect pre-tax profit for Ford Credit to be about the same as in 2013 and company pre-tax profit, excluding special items to be lower than this year ranging from $7 billion to $8 billion.
The operating effective tax rate next year should normalize at about 35%. This is due primarily to the non-repeat of higher than normal research and development credits and the reduction in Ford Credit tax liability that were both realized during 2013. Overall, 2014 will be a solid year for the company and a critical next step forward in implementing our ONE Ford Plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all.
Now looking beyond next year on slide 14, we expect the company’s volume and revenue to grow in 2015, with pre-tax profit, automotive operating margin and operating related cash flow all improving. This assumes, of course, a general continuation of recent global economic and industry volume growth trends.
Speaking of 2015 and beyond, we remain generally on track to achieve our outlook for the mid-decade period. Our targeted global automotive operating margin is at risks. This is due to the severe structural downturn in Europe and more tepid GDP and industry growth rates in South America than we expected in June 2011, when we initially provided our outlook, along of course, with a deteriorating environment in Venezuela. Overall, we expect the company’s results over the mid-decade period to be strong and improving from 2014.
In closing, our ONE Ford Plan is delivering profitable growth and we continue to be absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business and contributing to a better world. 2013 will end as an outstanding year for Ford, the fourth year in a row of strong financial results.
Our recent successes have been enabled by our successful restructuring in North America, the actions and decisions that helped us survive the great recession, while continuing to invest for today’s stronger business and continued execution of the ONE Ford Plan as we deal with the ever-changing dynamics of the global environment in which we operate.
2014 is the next step and a critical building block as we move forward in building stronger global brands, a growing business based on outstanding products that are desired and valued by customers around the world and a better balanced business from the standpoint of source of sales and profitability. All of this is supported by a strengthening balance sheet that will enable us to continue rewarding our investors with attractive returns.
And to your attention, we would now be pleased to take any questions as you may have, but just one point first. This is not an earnings call. We are going to have that towards the end of January. So, I know you are going to have lots and lots of questions and you want to get into lots and lots of detail. I am just telling you upfront, we are going to save the detailed answers for the January earnings call and we have all the data in front of us. Okay.
Question-and-Answer Session
George Sharp
Okay. So, with that, we would like to open it up to questions from those that are in the room here, please limit the duration of your questions and please identify yourselves before you start the question. So we will take our first question here.
Michael Ward - Stern Agee
Thanks George. Mike Wards, Sterne Agee. Can you quantify at all the financial impact of some of the changeovers and launches that are going on in North America in 2014?
Bob Shanks
The only thing I’ll say is that they are significant and that they essentially explain the decline in North America’s results that we are projecting.
Michael Ward - Stern Agee
That explains the down volume as well.
Bob Shanks
Yeah. Absolutely.
Michael Ward - Stern Agee
Okay.
John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just first –a follow up on Ward’s question on volume and the changeovers? As we think about what you are talking about a down volume here for Ford in an up-market…
Bob Shanks
In North America.
John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
In North America specifically, they -- is that specifically because you’re capacity constrained and there is just no way to produce more volumes, so this is almost by definition not a call on the market?
Bob Shanks
I think it’s probably a combination of two things. One, you are right, let say, we are projecting a growing industry next year. There are certain vehicle lines that are probably going to be building everything that we can. But what is driving the decline is actually the product launches that we talked about.
We have a lot of product launches next year as you saw on the slide. They affect the significant portion of the volume and of course, there are down weeks associated with that and it’s going to impact our ability to deliver the ongoing level of volume that those new products will give us in 2015 and beyond.
John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Then just a follow-up, if you’re capacity constrained and demand is rising, why would pricing come under pressure?
Bob Shanks
Because, again, the number of, well, I would say two things, John. It’s a good question. One is the amount of volume that’s affected by the downturn, and as the launch - and as you know, when you are at the end of a cycle, you generally will see a higher level of incentives before you go into the brand new product.
And the second thing, while there is a price elasticity element that is there, particularly where we’re constrained there also are just caps within segment in terms of what customers are willing to pay, because there is a lot of great products that are out there for as alternatives if they should choose to go elsewhere. So there is some natural limitation in terms of what you are going to be able to price even in a constrained situation with that much competitive activity.
John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then just lastly, I mean, to characterize the outlook for 2014, it really appears that this is more of shoulder year for investment and product launches to drive really the out year mid-decade results, I mean, is that sort of a fair characterization, I mean, it does seem…
Bob Shanks
Yeah. I think, it’s a very good characterization. It’s – we’ve had four very, very strong years of financial results. We have grown over that period. We are going to have an increase in global market share this year. That’s quite meaningful and as I said, jumping over ’14 we do expect coming out of ’14 that we are going to see improving results, improving growth, improving volume as we come out of the year. This year is very much affected by the amount of product launches that we have around the world and the amount of volume that’s affected by that.
So we are going to continue to invest heavily. Some of that is to support this year but a lot of it is to support what’s coming afterwards and as you might recall from what I just mentioned towards the end we are expecting CapEx to be about $7.5 billion next year. That’s up substantially from what we are planning this year.
John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then just one last one because I can’t let an $8 billion to $9 billion swing in the asset base or in the pension [inaudible] go without a question on that. Is it a potential to freeze any pension plans going forward or execute some of these annuity contracts that other companies have done with Prudential to get this liability off the balance sheet or potentially even do a deal with the UAW in the negotiations in 2015?
Bob Shanks
Well, putting aside the UAW, I mean, all those things are options other people have done that. It’s not something that we are planning to do, but the options are already there. So our focus is on getting the global funded plans fully funded and we are doing that on an economic value basis. We'll probably look a little bit over funded on our U.S. GAAP basis once we get there. Those other tools that you mentioned are there, but not what we are planning to do. And in terms of the UAW -- as we’ve said before, that would be subject to discussions with them and we keep that between ourselves and UAW.
Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan
Hi, Ryan Brinkman from J.P. Morgan.
Bob Shanks
Good morning, Ryan. How are you?
Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan
Good. Thanks.
Bob Shanks
Good.
Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan
So, I think the outlook for flattish profits in the Asia Pacific region in 2014 will be come -- is a little bit of a surprise just because of the recent sharp improvement trend there. You make some comments about the mid-decade margin outlook and attribute a potentially softer outlook there to changes in Europe and South America relative to 2011 expectations. But you don’t mention Asia, so are you trying to communicate that the pressures on Asia Pacific profits in 2014, which limit further improvement in profits over the near terms that those are purely related to 2014 and you still expect Asia Pacific to be a material contributor to mid-decade profits?
Bob Shanks
Number of things in your questions, which are I think helpful to talk about. One, let me start at the top. I think I have mentioned many times, not just in the context of Asia Pacific but any part of the business, nothing is ever linear. Everything is quite lumpy in this business and it’s so big that when certain elements of it move a little bit here or there, it could have an effect on the bottom line.
We have grown so much in Asia Pacific over the last several years and it has been relatively linear, not every quarter but it has been quite strong. As we move into next year, we expect to still grow in Asia Pacific as I mentioned. But we are also continuing to invest in Asia Pacific and at the same rate that we have them. In fact, you will see an increase in cost in Asia Pacific, as you have seen over the last number of years as we continue that glide path towards a much-much larger business than even we will see this year or next year.
So you are going to see those rising costs. You will see an improvement in the topline. It just won’t be next year at the same rate as it was this year and that’s because we have fewer launches, the amount of volume that’s affected by those launches in Asia Pacific next year, because of the product lines that are involved aren’t as significant as they were this year. And the more significant launches that will take place in Asia Pacific are towards the very end of the year.
So we also have production constraints, a number of the new products that we introduced last year and frankly even I think the year before, we can’t build any more. We will have more capacity coming later, but we are probably going to be capped a number of those vehicle lines next year.
So for that reason, as well as, as we are going through the restructuring in Australia and a weaker Australian dollar, we are seeing a decline year-over-year in the results in Australia. All of that is going to conspire to give us a sort of a flattish kind of bottom-line in Asia Pacific. But it’s a business that really is still growing and projected to grow much more strongly in the future.
Now tying that back to mid-decade, when we did the mid-decade guidance in June ’11, at that time it was before Europe collapsed and there is no forecast of Europe entering what now is a very severe downturn that’s going to last in terms of more tepid rates of growth for years. We didn’t include that in the outlook. We also didn’t have any view of Venezuela being the issue that it is. And frankly, I think we thought Brazil would grow a bit more strongly than they presently are.
So it’s really more an issue around Europe and South America. I didn’t mention North America. We expect North America to deliver the type of margins that we have guided to for the mid-decade. We expect Asia Pacific to be a very strong contributor, just as we had back in June of 2011. It’s really around the external events of Europe and much slower rates of growth in Brazil primarily, and then the issues of Venezuela that are affecting the likelihood that we are going to be able to deliver fully eight to nine that we guided to.
And I think we still have a chance through this. Why we are just [saying at] [ph] that risk? When we look at our internal numbers, we are actually not so far away from that. I think we have a reasonable shot at getting there, but I think with those two sorts of things that have happened since then it’s just going to be a harder slog than what we thought back in 2011. Okay.
Doug Carson - Bank of America
Doug Carson…
Bob Shanks
Hey Doug.
Doug Carson - Bank of America
….Bank of America. On the question on the balance sheet big picture, I think you may have ruled out a mid-decade target of automotive data about $10 billion?
Bob Shanks
We are on track for that.
Doug Carson - Bank of America
And you run, I think around $15.8 billion right now on the balance sheet. Can you give us a cadence of kind of how you think you will get down to the $10 billion? You have some DOE loan, you have some long dated debt, you have a convert, how do you take out the next $5 billion and does this lower pension funding that now you are going to be looking at, $1 billion or $2 billion versus $2 billion to $3 billion, does that kind of help you get to your target and at what rating you guys targeting with that $10 billion of debt?
Bob Shanks
Yeah, I mean it’s -- we get there -- it just basically through the normal amortization of the debt that we have on the books. The DOE has been $150 million or so every single quarter. We’ve got to convert the 2016 convert that I talked about. We have got some other debt including international debt that we just expect through the normal roll off of the terms that we will be able to get to the $10 billion that we have talked about. The $10 billion was just automotive debt. It did not include pensions, so when you think about the fact that we will have the funded pensions fully funded by mid-decade along with the $10 billion, I mean that’s a really-really good and strong structure for business of our size.
Itay Michaeli - Citi
Itay Michaeli from Citi. Just a question, Bob, in terms of how we should think about cost in North America and perhaps Europe as well in 2015. It sounds like this year is a big transition year for you, lot of product, lot of investment. I suppose you also have some pension tailwinds coming as well next year. Should we think about cost in North America as flattish, maybe even down in 2015, how should we think about the cadence of beyond ’14, once we get pass these investments? How much did these cost containment or even improvement will get you close to that 8% to 9% mid-decade targets?
Bob Shanks
I think the way I would think about it, as the company has been and continues to be in growth mode and if you go back to the mid-decade, which was the slide before that. Let’s turn back here for a second. You could see we are going towards 8 million units by mid-decade. That will do six and half-ish -- six and half, somewhere in that range this year, closer to about six, three, somewhere around that.
So, I think we see a lot of growth ahead of us. And we don’t plan to stop at eight. So we are investing for that. So you are going to see -- at a company level, you will continue to see structural costs going up, like you will see it recurring in manufacturing and that’s driven by the investments in the plants but also more capacity. You will see it in engineering as we continue to expand the factory to support more products and more markets and more segments around the world.
Our spending related costs are going up and that’s because we are investing more but also -- and you will see the same thing in ’14 that we saw in ’13. The favorable impact from the impairments that we took back in North America during the restructuring is continuing to run-off and so that would be a bit of a factor in that number.
We are still continuing to divest a bit more as we get larger and advertising and sales promotions around brand building efforts and a little bit in admin and selling and that’s largely around the people that we are adding. We had an announcement last week about the numbers that we will be adding next year both in North America and in Asia Pacific to support not only growth next year but ahead. So it’s all very thoughtful, it’s very specific and it’s around growth.
At the same time that we're doing that, we're also looking very closely at our breakeven and trying to make sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves and as we kind of project out to the levels of revenue and volume that we're targeting that we are satisfied that we've got a really good breakeven for the company at that point, but also where we are today.
Again, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because you never know when the downturn will occur and there will be one sometime. So we’re keeping a very close watch of that, but we are very comfortable with the overall structure that we're building and it is consistent with the type of operating margins that we are targeting.
Itay Michaeli - Citi
And then just as a follow-up to that. Of the 16 launches you have in North America in 2014, could we share the rough split of redesign, refresh in all new? And then it might be early to talk about cadence for next year, but is some of the pressure more first half weightage? We think about the second half exit as a stronger margin to 2015 and maybe you can talk about that?
Bob Shanks
Yeah. I think we’ll provide more on that as the year progresses in terms of -- because we haven’t announced all the vehicles that are part of that launch outlook. But there will be some significant launches in terms of volume effect and so forth in the second half of the year. But we'll have launches throughout the year, but there is a very heavy impact in the second half of the year.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Thanks. Dan Galves from Deutsche Bank. A couple of housekeeping and I have a couple additional questions. I believe that there is currently about $400 million of accelerated D&A in Europe in 2013. Is the $400 million next year incremental to that?
Bob Shanks
Yeah.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay.
Bob Shanks
It’s another $400 million.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Got it. And then --
Bob Shanks
Most of that is -- this year, we had accelerated depreciation related to Genk and the U.K. facilities. U.K. facility is now redundant or closed. Next year, it’s around Genk.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Got it. And then, are you able to give us an update on kind of projected U.S. only pension underfundedness?
Bob Shanks
I think we will do that in January.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay. No problem. And then on the North America business, you said that the launches this year would be a substantial level of the volume. Is there any -- can you be a little bit more specific on that? I mean, are we talking 50% to 60% of North American volume could launch this year or is it more in the 20% to 30% range?
Bob Shanks
We will be more specific on that in January.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Thanks. And then the final question is related to China. It's a big part of the mid-decade walk potentially, particularly because it doesn't affect the revenue denominator. Is there anyway you -- first of all, are you considering at all splitting out and reporting the JV earnings separately? Second of all, is there any kind of rule of thumb you could give us on the profit impact of incremental volume or where you stand currently in terms of your JV profitability?
Bob Shanks
We are thinking about breaking it out. We haven't made any decisions on that. I don't think we'll do that for '14, but I think it's something that we are having discussions around. So we'll see where that goes, because it is becoming a bigger and bigger part of not only the Asia-Pacific business but our total business. So, I think it's something that is on our minds, but not ready to do that for 2014. And I think on the other things that you asked now, I think we'll touch on those perhaps either in January or maybe at the next Ford University event.
Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank
Okay .Thank you.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Brian Jacoby, Goldman Sachs. Over here.
Bob Shanks
Hey, Brian.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Two quick ones for you. One, just on the cash flow side, obviously operating related cash flow will be down year-over-year but maybe, we know CapEx is driving that lower earnings but when you factor in the pension contributions that are on in their cash restructuring. Directionally, are we still going to be down year-over-year and is the magnitude of decline more than what you are kind of thinking for the operating related cash flow versus total?
Bob Shanks
You mean total?
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Exactly. Trying to get an idea on how you are going to end the year with cash, so thinking about cash restructuring this year versus next year and again the pension is going to be lower in terms of contribution. So presumably the outlook for cash is still quite good when you factor in those puts and takes and maybe just directionally if you can comment then I had a question on Ford Motor price?.
Bob Shanks
I think we'll get into that more detail in January when we could actually see the full-year results and you can see the details of that. We do expect, as I said the operating related cash flow to be down. And obviously it's going to be lower profits and also higher spending. We have also got -- we will have restructuring related or that restructuring but the separation related cash flow will start I think next year as well. Right, Stuart?
Stuart Rowley
Yeah. We will have absorbed the cash effect some of the separation payments be higher. Also we’ve also got the changes in debt year-to-year…
Bob Shanks
Right.
Stuart Rowley
…will be different. We thought early this year it will be different.
Bob Shanks
But we will give you a better feel on that in January. I think it's easier and better to do that when we’ve got the actual results for this year. So we can kind of look at it at the same time.
Bob Shanks
Ill later give you a better feel on that in January and I think it’s easier and better to that way (Inaudible) but actual results for this year. And we kind look at the same time.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Okay. Fair enough.
Bob Shanks
And then, Row, one thing for sure, I mean it goes without saying, but I will say it anyway. We will obviously be above our targeted liquidity levels both in terms of cash and our total liquidity.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
And you can give those again if you could just remind us.
Bob Shanks
Probably about $20 billion ongoing and about $30 billion in terms of -- $20 billion in cash and about $30 billion in terms of liquidity. We'll probably be a little bit higher on that at the end of this year and also probably be targeting a bit higher than that at the end of next year.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Okay. And then last one just a quick one on Ford Motor credit just again on the dividend for next year, we’re not getting the dividend, is that right or wrong?
Bob Shanks
We’re not going to say anything about that today.
Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs
Thanks.
Bob Shanks
That’s something we talk about in January.
Eric Sally - J.P. Morgan
Eric Sally, J.P. Morgan, kind of ferreting out that question. Looking at pension, you have $1.5 billion of mandatory contributions. Are you guys going to go above that or wait to see what interest rates do to get to your $10 billion mid-decade goal. Excuse me, funding that $10 billion here?
Bob Shanks
Well, as you know, we will have made by the time the year is over the $5 billion that we talk about to our funded plans this year. I think we also will have put about $400 million into the non-funded plans. So about $5.4 billion in total in 2013 and we’ll talk about the details of what we’re planning to invest for ‘14 at the January earnings call.
Eric Sally - J.P. Morgan
Then just, and Brian’s…
Bob Shanks
Obviously much, much less than what we did this year.
Eric Sally- J.P. Morgan
And probably reflect what their rates do in the first half?
Bob Shanks
Absolutely because we’ve seen this year obviously the contributions themselves have been a big help in terms of funded status. We've had so far positive asset returns and we've also seen of course the improving impact of the higher discount rate. So all of that has put us in a much better place which -- which gives us a really nice line of sight towards that target that we’ve got for the mid decade.
Eric Sally - J.P. Morgan
Natural hedge on rates. And then on Brian’s question, I know you are going to update us on the Ford Credit dividend but you still will be paying, reimbursing for the taxes as you’ve done in prior years as well because there’s been kind of two payments from Ford Credit back?
Bob Shanks
Yeah. I mean it’s either the dividend or the payment for taxes and we’ll provide some insight on that in January.
Eric Sally - J.P. Morgan
Great. And then just finally, could you talk about the cadence of the European when there’s a cash severance come out, one of those lumps and then kind of, is that right when we are suppose to start seeing some of the cost savings as people leave the plants or is there like a delay?
Bob Shanks
You'll see the plant operates right towards the end of the year. So we’re not projecting to see much in the way of cost savings from that until 2015.
Colin Langan - UBS
Colin Langan, UBS. Can I just get a -- I have a couple of question on Europe. I mean, what are the key drivers of improving that profitability next year particularly, if you have an additional $400 million of accelerated depreciation? Two, does that mean in ‘15 when the plan closes that there is an $800 million decline in depreciation in the accumulation and three, any view on your mid decade?
Bob Shanks
Okay. So I can’t remember that much.
Colin Langan - UBS
So why don’t you hold back?
Bob Shanks
We’ll do one at a time and I forgot the first one already. So the -- we have about $400 million of restructuring this year. We’re about $400 million of restructuring next year. All right. That goes away obviously as we go into 2015. We’ll also then see the improvement that comes from the plant being close and remember we talked about gross savings of, I think, it was $400 to $500 million or something along those lines.
We are also going to see a little bit higher industry as we’ve talked about next year. We started the product launches that will continue plus the year-over-year effect of the things that we’ve launched this year. So we expect to see good sort of favorable market factors, I think from Europe into ‘14 versus ‘13 and we would expect that to continue as we go into ‘15.
So remember what we talked about with Europe, its very, very much a story around stronger top line, stronger product line up, stronger brand, stronger average mix of our vehicle as we continue to bring in things like Edge, things like Mustang much more focused on the commercial vehicle segment and expanding our participation there.
So Europe is very, very much about growth and just getting more out of the business top-line then we have in the past. I think Stuart, you want to add something.
Stuart Rowley
Can I just clarify on the restructuring cost. The $400 million next year, it’s not incremental. So we had more this year and then we have similar number next year.
Colin Langan - UBS
Okay.
Stuart Rowley
400 -- little over 400 this year, 400 next year, then its gone.
Colin Langan - UBS
So is it because the plants that close?
Bob Shanks
It’s just the U.K plants that are close.
Stuart Rowley
Right exactly. This year we had the U.K. plant which we won’t have next year, which we had slightly relevant. So it’s significant.
Colin Langan - UBS
Okay. And in terms to your mid-decade target for profitability in Europe is that still on track?
Bob Shanks
Absolutely. I think, I said at least three times. And just to be sure, I mean, hereforth we expect -- fully expect to be profitable in Europe in 2015. The team is doing such a great job on all parts of the plan, very much on track and I think, we feel very, very good about achieving a profit in Europe in 2015.
Colin Langan - UBS
And any color you lowered the outlook for South America for this year. What exactly happened in the fourth quarter that’s causing that deterioration?
Bob Shanks
Its really two things, one is we’ve had very, very difficult time in getting dollars and we’re also very carefully managing our overall exposure as you can tell from the impact that we guided to for 2014 that we have a net Bolivar asset exposure, if you will. We’ve got about $700 million of cash there that we can just can't get out. And so that is the biggest part of what gets, if you will be valued when the exchange rate devaluation occurs, if and when it occurs.
So we can get dollars in order to pay other part for Ford, who were sending parts down to support production of the vehicles or after sales and service parts. So we’ve cut way, way back on production, in fact probably about 70% or so in terms of the rate of production that we are now planning relative to what it had been. So there's a big reduction in production.
And then the second thing is the government -- and you guys probably have read about this. They went into the equivalent of best buy and other things like that and just the prices, the government did.
They have come into the auto industry and they've looked at -- they coming in and audited. They’ve looked at details of cost versus margin price for after sales and service parts. And they’ve set prices for us. Those prices are lower than what they should be. They are lower than normal margins. And so we have reflected that or planning to reflect that impact in the fourth quarter because it was -- it's already been done.
We’ve let that flow through into our forward planning because this happened and the thing that I mentioned, as been a risk because we’ve not explicitly put an assumption in next year's outlook for this is if they should come in and do the same thing for new vehicle prices. So far they haven't done that but it’s certainly a possibility that they could. And so were just alerting you to the fact that’s a potential risk that could affect the business. We’ve not assumed that yet for 2014. If it happens we’ll tell you.
Colin Langan - UBS
One last question, in terms of the 8% to 9% mid-decade target as a risk. Is that more of a timing issue or is there structural issues in Europe and South America that put that permanently at risk?
Bob Shanks
I think, it’s -- well you can answer that in a couple of ways. It could be a little structural because I mean, what’s happened in Europe. We’ve described that as a structural downturn. That’s not a normal cyclical downturn. We’re at levels of volume compared to the peak in 2007 that are very, very low. It’s coming back now very, very gradually. We’ve seen that through this year and the search for each quarter. We’re expecting a bit of an improvement in ‘14. We’re still as assuming something around $15 million for the plenty of markets that we track in 2015, but again peak in 2007 was $17 million .
So it is -- it’s going to take a long time to get back to where Europe had been. In the case of South America, I don’t know, I mean, its Venezuela is not predictable, don’t know what’s going to happen to Venezuela. And frankly we’re raising a little bit of a yellow flag anyway on Argentina. There are elections there in 2015. There are a number of issues in terms of the economy now that are likely to create issues later.
But right now the market is quite robust because people wanting to buy hard assets to store values. So they are purchasing new cars and things like that to put there, if you will there, their worth in because it’s better than leaving them in currency. So it's actually giving us a bit of good news in ‘13 and maybe somewhat into ‘14. But at some point the party ends and there will be some sort of impact, that’s why we’re raising flag in Argentina.
Its actually not hurting results right now but at some point you have to be some sort of paying the piper and that could occur sometime in ‘15 or maybe a bit after the elections.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley, Bob. First, I just want to confirm, I think, I know the answer of this that the $7 billion to $8 billion pre-tax guidance next year does include the $400 million charges in Europe in the 350 bolivar?
Bob Shanks
Yes.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Second, I’m still a little confused on the $400 million delta from ‘13 to ‘14 in Europe, is that gross or net? Is it net of any accelerated appreciation that's non-repeating in ‘14, is a gross in there?
Bob Shanks
We have accelerated restructuring charges this year of about $450 million , I think right. It’s about $450 million. So that’s in the outlook that we have for 2013. Next year, the improving results that we guided to also has about $400 million of restructuring related charges in it. So we expect -- if you’re thinking about it going from $450 million this year to about $400 million next year. So it will be -- maybe $50-ish million or so of improvement just on that one aspect of the business. But there will be other things that are improving that will give us an improvement obviously above and beyond $50 million or so.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Just isolating the accelerated charges is actually a benefit from one year to next?
Bob Shanks
Probably about ‘15.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Okay, just wanted to clarify that.
Bob Shanks
Does that answer your question?
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
It does.
Bob Shanks
Okay.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Thank you .The Asia-Pacific guidance of stable on ‘14 versus ‘13. Does that also apply for China JV profit specifically?
Bob Shanks
It includes the China JV profit.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
But does that if you isolate China, is that also expected to be stable?
Bob Shanks
No.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Okay. So it's -- so the outside of China is in decline then? China would still be expected to grow next year?
Bob Shanks
Yes. Yes.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Any order of magnitude on that or we need to wait?
Bob Shanks
No. It’s not, I don’t think, it’s particularly material, but that I think going back to your earlier question, I think that's why at some point, probably will be helpful to break things out, we are just not at that stage yet.
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Thanks Bob. And just finally, I mean, it’s seems like a lot of the tone of the outlook caught clearly a very well, I think articulated deliberate profits warning for lack of better description on 2014. It seems to be related to and the tone is mostly timing issues related to Ford specifically? But there is an underlying current of the competitive market getting worse? Do you want take this chance to kind of elaborate on that, the pricing behavior, the yen, I mean, Ford’s been now spoken about the yen but that seemed to have been a steady current, is that something that’s noticeably changed to affect your guidance materially, any comments on that will be appreciate it.
Bob Shanks
Yeah. I think, thank you for giving me this opportunity, because I do want to tell you how we feel about, you had your own twist on it and interpretation and look forward to seeing what you guys all say about this.
We feel very, very good with all, worried about this year. I mean, this year is going to be one of the best years that we’ve had in our history, probably could be the best over the last 10 years plus or maybe second best. I mean, the really, really good year and it’s not just the profit or the cash flow, it’s the growth, it’s how broad the improvement is across the business. We feel very good about 2014 to be clear.
Our business is not linear. I've said that over and over and over again. Back in the restructuring of North America and a great recession, we invested very heavily in the business.
We have taken out that big loan. It gave us the ability to survive the downturn. It gave us the ability to fund all the separations and all a very difficult decision that we made. But more importantly then all, it gave us the ability to continue to invest.
So our losses during that period were greater than they would have been, if we had just done what people normally do during downturns, which is to pull into shell, cut, we didn't do that. We continue to invest because we know the business is cyclical and it will come back and it did.
So as we are looking forward, we are growth driven, we are committed to be a much bigger player in the business and to expand for the benefit of all of our shareholders profitable growth, not growth for growth sack, but profitable growth, that’s exactly what we are doing now.
We're investing in the business everywhere and so we have a lot of launches this year that are the result of investments we made over the last number of years. They will affect particularly in North America volume in a bit, it’s not terribly material about the negative pricing, I think, I used the words slightly or somewhat, it’s not a huge number, but it will be quite a different from what we have seen over the last call it the five years or so in terms of very, very strong pricing coming out of North America.
And that’s driven by couple of things. One is the launch affect but also as we have said a number of times particular over the last year, we've essentially close the gaps that we had versus competition on the Ford brand.
So now it's more related to the equipment that we get or the newness of the product or perhaps the weakness growth or the strength of a competitor that’s going to really give us the ability to the price up to an extent that that we can or perhaps in some cases not price as strong as we might wanted to. It is more competitive from that standpoint.
We have kind of close gaps and now we are sort of right there with everybody else. It will be driven more I think by, how we can distinguish ourselves, strengthen the brand and just get all these great products out there.
So it -- I mean the healthy thing, Adam, is that we’ve worked our way to the point now that we are right there with the best and if we are going to be competing for volume and revenue with a very best and at very, very strong transaction prices.
If you look at the J.D. Power PIN data, our transaction prices are very healthy, very strong even on F-series versus the new competitors that is up against, it’s doing extremely well on a transaction price, it’s up year-over-year. Its incentives are up, but the transaction prices are up. So we feel really, really good about our North America's position.
But going into next year, it’s really around launches and I think the fact that the gaps that we've had, we just have less ability to get that delta, we are now just sort of at that sort of probably competitive level with the very best in the business, which is where we want to be. Does that answer your question?
Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley
Yeah.
Bob Shanks
Okay.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Thanks for taking my question. Dan Levy, Barclays. As we try to say follow up on some of the prior questions on Asia. We try to get a sense for, one, there maybe an inflection in profitability and obviously, some of what's going on is, there is some macro. But just wanting to get a sense for, how the progression of the cost of winding down Australia facilities goes past 2014, how that progresses?
And just how the launch cost in ‘15 might look relative to ‘14 and at what point you really especially in China start to reap the benefit of having sort of the full product out there, understand from prior call that you have mentioned that in some cases you are -- there is, you maybe leaving some of the sales off the table just by not having the full product out there. So just trying to get a sense for at what point things really turnaround when you get the full product out there and then when it’s offset the incremental investment?
Bob Shanks
Okay. So your first question is on Australia, right.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Yeah. The progression of the wind up?
Bob Shanks
Yeah. So we are, just as, I mean, our practice is that we, when we have these types of restructurings same thing was in North America, same thing in Europe and Australia, we basically now are accelerating the depreciation of the asset that we will closed in 2016.
So that was in the results, is in the results this year, that will be in the results next year. So it’s not a year-over-year decline but it’s an absolute impact on the business. So that’s included in Australian results. It’s included in our Asia-Pacific results.
What we are also seeing in the Australia though is a very competitive environment. This is one of the markets where we believe we are seeing the impact of the weaker yen. The Japanese are very, very strong in Australia and traditionally, it’s a market that’s quite profitable for them that we’re seeing a lot of pricing pressure there.
But we also as we're going through the restructuring and we still have the plant open, we still have the costs associated with the plant, the products that are in the plant obviously will be going out of production over the next two -- two years, three years in 2016. So we are seeing some pressure.
I think, on that part of the business as we’re focusing on growing the rest of the lineup preparing for the day when we close the facility and the products that are made there are discontinued.
So I think in general, Australia is in good place in terms of the plans that we have going forward but next year just given the plan that we have and the period of time that we’ve got, go between the announcement in May of this year and then closing in ‘16, just be a bit of a challenge for us in Australia in 2014.
Now, in terms of reservation, China is doing -- China is doing really, really well. China -- we’re making good profits in China. We’re growing in China, we’ll grow again next year. The constraints that we have are around a number of product lines, not all made in China by the way. So in China, there will be some constraints. So to your point of leaving some sales on the table if we had more capacity, we believe we could sell more.
And in fact, the team is working globally to try to -- if we can't break up at least to some extent, some of the capacity constraints that we've assumed in the outlook that we’ve given today. So we'll see if we can make some progress on that as the year progresses but I just want to remind everybody, when we talk about Asia-Pacific being the same in terms of profitability next year versus this year, this year is a record and it’s going to be a record by a lot.
So this is at a level that you will, that’s a level that we have never achieved before. And we’re going to sustain that level as we continue to invest and then expect to improve going forward across the business coming out of 2014.
Matt Miller - Bloomberg TV
Matt Miller, Bloomberg TV. Hi Bob. How are you?
Bob Shanks
Hey, how are you?
Matt Miller - Bloomberg TV
Good. I wonder about the importance of a launch of a big product like new F-150. Would you want to put that in 2013, F-150, for example, in September, October. And then would be a problem if you were somehow pushed back to January, February, you know what I mean?
Bob Shanks
I accept we haven't said anything about launching a new F-series. So that’s a very hypothetical question.
Matt Miller - Bloomberg TV
All right. Fair enough. Do you typically like to time new launch at the end of the year? I mean we see that all the time with all carmakers. So is it beneficial for you to get them out in the beginning of the fourth quarter, end of the third quarter?
Bob Shanks
No. I think in the old days when I was much younger, particularly in North America, you always want to try to launch the support sort of the new model here in August, September announcing just come and we’re ready because the factory is so full. The PD Factory is so full, that things basically will -- products will come out when they're ready, just based upon where they are in the whole factory cadence in terms of completing products. And we’ve had launches all throughout the year.
But in terms of the number of launches and the amount of volume that’s expected, as I said earlier probably have more of an impact in terms of launches, the second half and then first half.
Matt Miller - Bloomberg TV
And then I finally wonder what do you expect from Mustang? I mean as far as sales here and also as far as sales and market that previously hadn’t had an access to it?
Bob Shanks
I think we were blown away by the reaction to the Mustang. I mean, we expected to have a great reaction, I think but -- obviously but the reaction particular overseas was really fantastic to actually have a vehicle that was specifically designed and developed not just for North America and in the other people would get what -- you've taken North America, I mean this is right-hand drive, it’s left hand drive. It's been designed specifically for these markets around the world. That was recognized by the media particularly in Europe, Australia because of the right-hand drive, left-hand drive.
The powertrains are -- the types of powertrains that will -- would make sense in these types of markets. So the reaction that we got in North America was great, outside of North America, I think we were blown away and the dealers were really pumped around the world. So it really is a global product. And I think it's going to have great success outside of North America as well this year, not just in terms of sales but the image.
And the other thing that’s interesting we got all these -- some one told me the other day, we’ve got a number of -- I forgot the number one, quite a number of Mustang clubs including quite a few around the world and we have these in markets in where we don't even sell it. Just got such a positive image for the brand, I think actually having such a fabulous product as the ’15 Mustang is going to make a big difference for the brand in all these markets that we’ll be showing today.

Hey Bob, Mike Ramsey from The Wall Street Journal.

Hey Mike.

With 16 launches in North America, 22 around the world, it was even mentioned in the report today that the warranty costs related to the recall on 1.6 liter engine affected the earnings. It's a very aggressive launch schedule next year. What is Ford doing specifically of anything to ensure that you don't have in a big quality issues, recalls and things like that could such a back?
Bob Shanks
It is something that Mark Fields has been spending a lot of his time on since he has been in his present position of Chief Operating Officer, working with particularly the functions that most directly support launches to make sure that we've gone back and look to lessons learned from our prior launches, to make sure that broad PD process, the metrics behind it, the deliverables that we’re supposed to meet a particular gateways that in fact those were the right thing we’re measuring, that we’re actually following the process, delivering on those types of output that we had expected at those points in time, making sure we’ve got the right cadence and gaps between the big launches, not just in a plan but in the region. So, I think the team has been doing a lot of hard work on process, but also just the hard work of the metrics and delivering the physicals with all these launches.
And making sure the right quality levels to make sure that what comes out is something that we are all going to be proud of them and that’s how we feel. I think we will definitely learn from what we've experienced over the past and we are committed to making sure that these launches go successfully and they are great products right from the beginning.

The other question I have is you kind of touched on it. You’ve reached a place where you've gotten equal footing with your main competition and pricing and other areas of
Bob Shanks
North America.
Mike Ramsey - The Wall Street Journal
…North America. How do you feel about -- have we reached the point where easy gains are over, that it is going to be difficult to show dramatic profit margin increases and is it just going to be mainly a topline for Ford from here out?
Bob Shanks
I think what we'll see is, we expect to see topline growth because we are investing heavily in not just more products but even better more competitive products, not just in North America but around the world that we are entering new markets, new segments. So, I think that we've got a lot of opportunity for growth there. And I think even -- let’s just take North America as an example. Even within North America, when we’ve got a particularly strong product, I think we will be able to get a level of revenue that might be more competitive or better than another competitor.
So let’s just take, Fusion for example. That is a very, very strong product and right now we are getting about $2,000 of transaction price, more than the volume competitor. So that’s $2,000, it’s very competitively priced. But when you just look at the price and volume relationship that we think is appropriate for us relative to that particular competitor, we are getting $2,000 more per unit.
George Sharp
And we’ll take our last question.
Jaime Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you for slotting me. Jaime Albertine from Stifel Nicolaus.
Bob Shanks
Hey, Jamie.
Jaime Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus
Wanted to sort of focus on Venezuela and then sort of outback little bit more broadly speaking on sort of the list of items that you have in terms of the sort of ongoing restructuring efforts and the growth you’ve alluded to invest in going forward. But first in Brazil, obviously some structural impediments, cash trapped in the market. But it doesn’t sound like things are getting any better down there and perhaps Argentina is next.
How important are those two countries to your ongoing sort of strategy or your long-term strategy and then separately? So what -- now that Genk has sort of happened, the U.K. is restructured to some extent, Australia this year, what are the next sort of high-priority items on your list of things to do?
Bob Shanks
In restructuring list, the things to do, okay. I think all markets are important -- four things, all markets are important. South America is -- it's a big market. It’s at the moment nearly smallest of the existing business units that we have, but it’s growing tremendously here and it has grown tremendously. A lot of those markets have reached and are well into the takeoff stage of disposable income at which folks start to want to buy vehicles and start to buy vehicles. The issues in South America I think are more around policies -- economic policies by the government.
And I think that's where -- and they may not -- the situation that we are looking at today may not be the situation five years or 10 years from a policy perspective. So you want to participate, you want to be there, you want to be part of that growth story in that region. You just have to figure out how to do it within the environment in which you are operating. And that’s what we are doing in South America.
Brazil has the potential to grow much more strongly than it is at least in the near-term. Argentina has some pretty significant economic issues that at some point as I mentioned earlier, there will be consequences. And in Venezuela, it's an extremely difficult situation for business, not just automotive but more broadly but we want to be there. We've been there for -- Bill and Mark and others were down in Argentina, I think in November we celebrated our 100 anniversary, so we've been through this. This is not something new for us.
We know how to do this and we will get through this. It’s an important market and we’ve made money there and we will continue to participate going forward and we are quite confident that we will be able to make a reasonable return in the future. In 2014 -- as last year, we’ve got some issues that are going to be things that we are just going to have to deal with.
Jaime Albertine - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay.
George Sharp
Thank you very much, Bob. Before we close, I would just like to make one very minor point of clarification. Bob talked earlier about the 2016 convert that we have, that we can terminate the conversion rights on that, towards the end of 2014 and settle it in cash. It was also a second, very-very small convert that comes due in 2036, that has a principal value right now of only $25 million that we can actually terminate its rights later this week and we likely will end up doing that. So when you see that announcement, it is not the big $1.7 billion that we’ve taken actually. So with that, I would just like to thank everyone for coming today either in the room here, or via the web and have a great holiday season.
Bob Shanks
We’ll hang around if you guys want to ask any follow-up questions.
