Sign Your Name Like Jack Lew With This Signature Generator
One of the most interesting bits of information to come out about soon-to-be-appointed Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, is his nearly unbelievable, did-a-second-grader-just-scribble-that, signature. 
The website mechanicalscribe.com has created a Jack Lew signature generator, so you can see how yours, or anyone else's signature would look in Lew style.
While the jury is out on what, if anything, this loopy signature reflects on his personality and decision making abilities, it is amusing to think that this squiggly jumble (or some tamed-down version of it) could appear on every piece of paper legal tender in the United States of America.
