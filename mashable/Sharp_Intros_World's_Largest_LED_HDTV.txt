Sharp Intros World's Largest LED HDTV
LAS VEGAS â€” Sharp Electronics is trying to carve out a bigger piece of the super-sized HDTV market, unveiling 21 new 60-inch-and-above HDTVs at CES 2013.
The models range from a 60-inch HDTV to the World's biggest, a 90-inch, room-filling LED HDTV. To put that in perspective, that's 4 feet tall and almost 7 feet wide. It's approximately 5 inches deep. The TV joins Sharp's growing Aquos line of HDTVs. The 141-pound monster ... er ... TV will still be stretching a 1080p resolution over all that expansive screen real estate. 
Sharp, though, isn't leaving the Ultra-HD market behind. 
It also unveiled its first 4K Ultra HD display, a 60-inch Aquos TV that employs I-cubed Research Center's ICC Purios technology. Sharp also boasted during its press conference that the TV's picture quality has been certified by THX (apparently a first for 4K TVs). It's should be noted, however, that Toshiba's new 4K Ultra HD set is a whopping 84 inches.
Sharp offered no pricing details on the set, but said it should arrive in stores this summer.
Not every 4K announcement at CES 2013 is a big one. Sharp also announced a new 32-inch 4K business display based on yet another technology: IZGO. You can learn more about it here.

Like most HDTV manufacturers, Sharp is not leaving 1080 behind (how could they? There's still no content for 4K displays). Today it announced three new Sharp Aquos Quattron (RGB and Yellow) 3D LEDs ranging in size from a 60-inch model for $3999.99 to the 80-inch LC-80LE857 for $6,499.99. 
All three models will feature Active 3D (that's the kind that requires special, synced 3D glasses) Smart TV Wi-Fi and Web-browsing capability. These new models will also support split-screen use, which means you can watch live TV on one side and browse the Web on the other.
Non-3D options will also available for all of these HDTVs, with prices ranging from $1,499.99 for the 60-inch model to $4,999.99 for an 80-inch HDTV. There are almost a dozen TVs in the Aquos line-up in a wide-range of pricing and feature options. Most of the new models will arrive sometime in Q1 of this year.
