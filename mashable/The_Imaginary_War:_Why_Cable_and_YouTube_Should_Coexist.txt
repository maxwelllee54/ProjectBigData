The Imaginary War: Why Cable and YouTube Should Coexist
Traditional television and YouTube have been at war for what seems like years now. So who's winning? 
Neither. At least not yet. YouTube struggles with quality and regularity, while TV networks still scramble to decipher the Internet. Both must accept that they are really two different ecosystems, and people want both.

YouTube has grown wildly in seven years thanks in large part to its openness. It's been a place for the users, by the users. But every tech company has to grow up and make money, and this is YouTube's moment. Many have speculated the video juggernaut could become Television 2.0, putting traditional media in danger.
But this battle for the future of video might not be so epic. We need to stop making either side feel like they need to compete for our attention. 
Cable television is not going anywhere — at least not anytime soon. The majority of Americans are still watching television — an average of four hours and 39 minutes per day, according to Brian Stelter at the New York Times. The difference is how and when they watch it. Fewer people are tuning into shows as they air. Multi-tasking, mobile Millennials might not even watch an entire show on-demand. 
This is why cable needs YouTube in the digital age. Most of the biggest moments in television — be they live, late night, morning talk shows, sketch comedy, reality television — are captured and shared online. They are the juicy pieces that carry the show from a traditional audience to social viewers. Most networks understand this is now critical, and will only grow in importance.
Rather than finding a solution to piracy, networks need to stop sweating over losing viewers to online video and find a way to make it work. If they don't find a way to quickly and easily distribute content online, someone else will.
YouTube itself plays nice by improving the TV experience for those who watch videos on a big screen.
Most networks have found success on YouTube by adding small segments before or during a show's airing. Showtime released episodes of Dexter and Homeland on YouTube in conjunction with its television premiere. The network has since made those videos private, but it's a step in the right direction.
Jimmy Kimmel goes as far as using YouTube to get users involved in the show, ultimately providing free programming and more viewership.
Some networks have attempted to bridge the digital gap by bringing YouTube shows to television. The most recent example would be Recipe Rehab's jump to ABC, while maintaining its presence online. A cooking show might be a rare example that actually works, because it's already a reference tool. People watching the show are more inclined to find the recipe online.
Television networks benefit from this portability because web shows can prove their following. Take The Annoying Orange, a series of viral videos that was picked up by Comedy Central. This was already a marketable franchise before Viacom risked a penny producing it for television.
YouTube is a valuable part of the news cycle, especially in 2012. The Weather Channel's continuous live stream of Hurricane Sandy coverage had 13 million views. Videos tagged "Obama" or "Romney" were watched 2.7 billion times. Felix Baumgartner's daredevil space jump was viewed live by 8 million people — beating Discovery Channel's live broadcast, which served 7.6 million people. As more people use YouTube, record numbers will continue to break. Traditional media simply cannot ignore online numbers anymore
Not every YouTube channel is a fit for television, but most online producers would still consider jumping to traditional media the ultimate success.  
Many YouTube stars have relied on traditional media to jump-start their web-based career. When Billy Eichner does a segment on Conan, a simple plug brings hundreds of new viewers from TV to his online presence, including his YouTube channel. It can take a YouTube personality years to organically build a following large enough to make a living from.
There is and will continue to be great content made on YouTube. The best stuff is made by and for YouTubers. That's arguably YouTube's biggest strength — empowering people make their own content and decide what's worth watching.
In 2012, YouTube invested $100 million in 100 premium channels, leading many to believe it was taking on the traditional entertainment industry. Only 30 to 40% of those contracts are being renewed, but a larger question has yet to be answered.
Why would the company cannibalize its own user base?
Rather than serving as an amazing tool that allows users to make wonderful things, YouTube wants to be a part of content creation. 
This competition within has sparked a trend in production studios, which the company supports in small partnership. These studios help manage and produce channels that have typically reached a significant amount of followers — usually people who work on YouTube channels full-time.
The YouTube Space, the company's most recent endeavor, is a physical studio area where YouTube creators can network, create content and rent equipment. It's a cool idea, except I have to live in Los Angeles to utilize it. 
What used to be a platform that leveled the playing field is now investing in traditional media practices.
If YouTube does not accept itself as a platform, and allow video makers complete creative control, creatives may be less inclined to host videos on the site. Future generations are digital natives — if they don't like something online, they'll figure out how to make a better version. It's the same reason YouTube "disrupted" the television industry in the first place: more access, less rules.
This might explain why YouTube opened the exclusive Partner Program to everyone last year. In order to become a partner, you no longer have to be a celebrity or garner a million views — just enable your account and successfully monetize at least one of your videos. It's the least intrusive way to provide a solid platform and still make a profit. 
Nearly every video on YouTube now has an ad before it, but the company managed to minimize ad time by implementing the "skip ad" feature. Users can skip ads on 65% of videos. This small act of consideration for user experience is how YouTube disrupted traditional media in the first place. Put users first.
The relationship between YouTube and television is vital. As devices and streaming become more accessible and more mobile, people will continue to find ways to view their favorite shows and create new content.
