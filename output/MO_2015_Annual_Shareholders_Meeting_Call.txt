Marty Barrington
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Altria Group’s 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which I now call to order. I am Marty Barrington, Chairman, CEO and President of Altria Group. I want to wish a warm welcome to everyone who is here today or if you are listening on our webcast. With me this morning are Denise Keane, Altria’s General Counsel and Brandt Surgner, our Corporate Secretary.
Our remarks today contain certain forward-looking statements and reference non-GAAP financial measures. Please direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures on altria.com.
The cards on your seats include the agenda, rules of our meeting and an investor highlights card. We will start by presenting certain formal documents, proceed to the election of Directors, vote on two compensation plans, and then move to the vote on the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Altria’s independent registered public accounting firm. We will then share a brief business update followed by a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of Altria’s named executive officers. A question-and-answer session will follow and then we will vote on three shareholder proposals if properly presented. Brandt will report on the preliminary voting results and then we will adjourn. So, Brandt, let’s present the meeting documents.
Brandt Surgner
Thanks, Marty. I present together with the affidavits of mailing a copy of the notice of meeting form of proxy, proxy statement and annual report, which includes financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The holders of record of common stock at the close of business on March 30, 2015 are entitled to vote at this meeting. 87% of Altria’s common stock is represented here today. So, a quorum is present for transacting business.
Marty Barrington
Thank you. Please file the documents with the records of the meeting. I appoint representatives from Computershare, the transfer agent for Altria’s common stock as Inspectors of Election. The inspectors should please now execute the oath and take custody of all proxies and the certified list of holders of common stock as of close of business on March 30, 2015. This list, which is available for inspection throughout the meeting, contains the names and addresses of all shareholders of record and the shares held by each. The inspectors’ responsibility is to determine the number of shares represented at the meeting and to certify the vote of all matters presented. All proxies and ballots are confidential unless shareholders have written comments on them. We will now distribute proxy cards to any shareholders in the room, who haven’t yet returned them. Shareholders who have already returned their cards or voted by other means do not need to submit a new card. So, please raise your hand if you need a proxy card.
Okay, thank you. Upon conclusion of the voting, please return the card to an usher for delivery to the inspectors. I want to welcome our Board of Directors, all of whom are here today. Their skills, diverse experiences and perspectives provide Altria with strong leadership and thoughtful oversight. The election of the Board of Directors is our first agenda item. Denise, please announce those nominees’ names appearing in the proxy statement.

Marty Barrington
Thank you. Those in the room, wishing to vote on the ratification of PwC should please do so now. We are now pleased to share with you a short business update. Shareholders are familiar with our business results through various means including our 2014 annual report, our presentation at the CAGNY Conference and our first quarter earnings release. We also recently completed our 2014 corporate responsibility report and all those materials are available at altria.com. So rather than repeat all of that information here, we have prepared a card of highlights of the following four areas about which we will comment briefly. A high level summary of full year 2014 and first quarter 2015 operating and financial results, a focus on our people and work culture, our commitment to our communities and our corporate responsibility initiatives.
So, let’s start with our operating and financial results. 2014 was a very strong year for Altria and its shareholders and we believe that Altria continues to be a terrific investment. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share 8%. We grew our dividend 8.3% and paid shareholders $3.9 billion in dividends. The smokeable products segment grew adjusted operating companies income 6.7%. Marlboro achieved record retail share of 43.8%, larger than the next 10 brands combined. Copenhagen and Skoal combined achieved record retail share of 51.2% since the UST acquisition. Nu Mark expanded its MarkTen e-vapor product nationally and acquired Green Smoke to complement its portfolio. And we delivered total shareholder return of over 34%, far outpacing the S&P 500 and the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco Index.
Turning to 2015, our businesses are off to a strong start against our full year objectives. Altria’s 2015 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 10.5%. And each of our reportable segments grew their operating companies income and their margins. Therefore, we reaffirm our guidance for 2015 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $2.75 to $2.80, representing growth of 7% to 9% from our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.57. We produced these excellent results with clear strategies, strong execution by our talented employees and our mission framework that continues to guide us.
We achieve success through excellent people and we view each of our approximately 9,000 employees as leaders. Our companies operate in highly regulated, dynamic and competitive industries, so it’s important we provide employees with the programs, training and tools to help them and our companies succeed. In 2014, we launched a company-wide effort focused on simplification, innovation and diversity and inclusion, three areas that are critical to our culture and future success. To help emphasize these areas, we conducted an executive leadership program for officers, a leadership summit for approximately 240 directors and vice presidents and a redesigned program for first-time managers. These efforts along with many others are helping our employees succeed. In fact, last month, Forbes magazine recognized Altria as one of America’s top 100 best employers.
We are also fostering diversity and inclusion through an Executive Diversity Council, which I chair and through the expansion of employee resource groups. In 2015, DiversityInc magazine named Altria as one of the 25 Noteworthy Companies for diversity. Altria continued to strengthen the communities where we live and work. In 2014, our companies contributed more than $50 million to non-profit organizations in our local communities with a focus on supporting positive youth development, protecting the environment and arts and culture. In 2014, the Civic 50 recognized Altria as one of America’s most community-minded companies.
Our employees continue to contribute to our communities and we are extremely proud of their generosity. In 2014, they volunteered more than 50,000 hours to company-sponsored service projects. And the Altria Companies Employee Community Fund, which our employees fund and manage, donated over $3 million to more than 100 deserving organizations.
Altria and its companies actively participate in resolving business-relevant societal concerns. These include helping reduce underage product use, reducing the harm caused by tobacco products, helping reasonable regulation succeed and promoting a sustainable supply chain. Kids should not smoke or use any tobacco products. Our tobacco companies continue to invest in positive youth development programs to help kids build self-confidence, make healthy decisions and resist risky behaviors, including tobacco use. In 2014, our tobacco companies invested over $20 million in our Success360 initiative, which promotes the healthy development of middle school kids.
Underage smoking is at historic lows, but there is still more work to do. The CDC recently reported an increase in e-vapor usage among youth. Our companies are taking steps to help address this issue. For example, Altria and Nu Mark are advocating for e-vapor minimum age laws at the state and federal levels. And so far, 44 states have passed this legislation. Also, Nu Mark requires retailers who accept its promotional programs to sell MarkTen e-vapor products only to consumers old enough to buy tobacco.
For adults who continue to use tobacco products, a growing body of evidence suggests that some tobacco products are less harmful than others. So, our tobacco companies continue to focus on developing lower risk products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers. We believe FDA has an unprecedented opportunity to advance public health goals by recognizing that some types of tobacco products may have significantly lower risk compared to cigarettes.
For several years, our companies have worked with various stakeholders, such as the Farm Labor Practices Group and the Elimination of Child Labor in Tobacco Foundation, to address issues such as child labor, grower and worker training and farm labor contractor compliance. We are a founding member of the U.S.-based Farm Labor Practices Group and we lead its training and education task force. The task force recently rolled out enhanced training on labor management, including how to prevent green tobacco sickness. We have helped design this training for an estimated 10,000 growers in 11 states in 2015. So, the executive leadership team and I are very pleased with Altria’s strong business performance and the momentum of our company. We thank our talented employees for delivering strong results and for their commitment to our mission and values.
Now, we will have an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. While this is vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee intends to consider its outcome when making future decisions for our named executive officers. We believe that our executive compensation programs contribute to our business results and strong shareholder returns. As the proxy statement fully describes, we designed these programs to align the interest of executives and shareholders, promote the company’s mission and business strategies and reward the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals.
At the 2014 Annual Meeting, nearly 94% of the votes cast approved the compensation of our named executive officers. The Board recommends that shareholders approve on an advisory basis the compensation for our named executive officers as described in the proxy statement. So, those shareholders in the room wishing to vote on this matter should please do so now.
We will now transition to our 30-minute question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please use one of the microphones in the isles. We’ll alternate between them until our time is up or there are no further questions and we have ushers back there to assist you. We welcome this opportunity to hear from you. It’s hard to provide everyone who wishes to ask a question an opportunity, each speaker should please limit his or her question to 2 minutes. We have a lighting system that will help guide us. The yellow light means 30 seconds remains for the question and a red light means you should please conclude. I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
You may ask a follow-up question after all other shareholders have asked theirs. And if there is not enough time for all the questions today, please complete and return the comment card and we will respond to you promptly. So, please identify yourself and address your question to me. And let’s begin.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Ann Gurkin
Good morning, Mr. Barrington. It’s Ann Gurkin with Davenport.
Marty Barrington
Hi, Ann.
Ann Gurkin
Congratulations on a terrific first quarter.
Marty Barrington
Thanks.
Ann Gurkin
And strong start to the year where you grew your reported cigarette shipment volumes, improved margins and delivered price realizations. Mr. Barrington, what is the sustainability of such strong performance in the current environment as the year unfolds?
Marty Barrington
Well, we have given our guidance for the year, Ann. And I think it reflects the confidence we have in the business. We have been growing in line with our long-term aspiration of 7% to 9%. When you look over the last 5 years, for example, we have been at about 8% of the total shareholder returns. We had 34.5% last year, 30% the year before that. And if you look at it over the 5-year period, you can see how strong it is. The industry dynamics right now are fairly strong. We have to come and earn it everyday, but with the talented people we have and the clarity of our strategies, we are pretty confident about the guidance we have given and I appreciate your comments about our business. Let’s go over here.
Michael Spock
Yes, hello Chairman, Barrington. My name is Michael Spock and I represent the AFL-CIO. I am here today to give you a letter signed by over 40 organizations that are part of the child labor coalition. This letter is a follow-up with the coalitions June 24, 2014 letter sent to Altria aligning a number of steps to eliminate child labor from the tobacco supply chain. I am wondering if I can give this to one of your – and then present it to you. Now, the child labor coalition is riding Altria in support of efforts by the Farm Labor Organizing Committee to establish a system for tobacco farm workers in North Carolina to negotiate for better wages, improved working conditions and establish a committee that can resolve issues for tobacco workers and growers when they arise. The child labor coalition asks that Altria sign a Memorandum of Understanding with FLOC to negotiate recognition of the Dunlop Commission regarding tobacco growers and farm workers in your supply chain. The Dunlop Commission has been successful in the past in establishing a private system of union recognition and dispute resolution between corporations, growers and workers. Agricultural workers are not covered by U.S. federal labor law. So, there is no process in place for farm workers to use, to organize and exercise their freedom of association. The commission would set out rules and regulations with participation of all sides, including the tobacco industry to mediate differences and address the long-term challenges workers and their families face in the tobacco industry. The expansion of the Dunlop Commission proposed by FLOC establishes field-based monitoring and a resolution system for labor rights abuses, including child labor, and makes provisions for remedies when appropriate. This would be an important counterpart to your increased commitments to end child labor.
Mr. Barrington, the fact is that there is no child labor on farms in North Carolina where tobacco farm workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. While the training, education, regulation standards…
Marty Barrington
Why don’t – can you close we have run a bit over, I don’t want to cut you off, but if you could maybe close I will try to respond I think I have...
Michael Spock
Right, it seems like 30 seconds
Marty Barrington
That’s okay. Take a second and close please.
Michael Spock
Okay. Thank you. The child labor coalition urgency to boost your efforts combat child labor like signing an agreement with FLOC to participate in the don’t let condition process. Mr. Chairman, can you provide the child labor coalition with the contact at Altria with whom we can discuss these issues?
Marty Barrington
Well, thank you very much for your comments. Welcome to the meeting. We are glad you are here. Let me talk about two aspects of what you raised. One is the right of the association of labor and other is the child labor issue. I will tell you how we are working on that and then of course we would welcome the opportunity to continue our dialogue with you and others that we have been speaking to about the issue. You listened on rights of association, we support the rights of workers that organized. No stronger proof of that I think has been in the many labor agreements we have in our own factories. Many of our factories I should know are unionized. We have always enjoyed excellent relationships with our labor unions who represent our people and we support that. We say the same thing to our growers in the supply chain which is we call upon them through our supplier code of conduct and our contracts to respect the rights of workers including on the farm. So, they are not our employees of course, but they do for the growers and we called on them, tell line themselves against the approach we have taken in terms of respecting rights of the associations.
With regards to child labor I think you are familiar with all the steps we have taken in this regard, some of which I mentioned in my remarks. We have belonged to the eliminating child labor foundation for many years and we have been active there. We were a founding member of the Farm Labor Practices Group which is talking about this issue and taking steps to improve it. You probably know we changed our contracts this year to require that no one work on a farm in the United States, say if certain exceptions for family farms and religious communities. Less than 16 and indeed if they are less than 18, we now require for rental consent that all represents progress that we have made with your group and others who are like minded on the issue. We support many of the issues and we are happy to engage in the continuing dialogue with you. And I appreciate you coming to share the perspective this morning.
I need to go over here towards. Forgive me, you can ask a follow-up question after others finish. Okay, please. Let me just go to this gentlemen here the respectable. Thank you.
Edward Sweda
Good morning Mr. Barrington. Edward Sweda, shareholder from Massachusetts.
Marty Barrington
Hi, Mr. Sweda.
Edward Sweda
Hello. According to Altria Group’s most recent form 10-K filed with the SEC quote an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. Damages claimed in some tobacco related or other litigation are significant and in certain cases ranged in the billions of dollars. Just last month the Boston Globe reported on an upsurge of tobacco product liability lawsuits that have been filed in Massachusetts and I was spread on by recent ruling from the State’s Supreme Judicial Court that is favorable to plaintiffs in those cases. Moreover, Altria’s Form 10-K also states on Page 67 that the court after exhausting all appeals in those cases resulting in adverse verdicts associated with tobacco related litigations since October of 2004, PMUSA has paid in the aggregate judgments and related cost on fees. They paid totaling approximately $144 million as of December 31, 2014. So my question is why shouldn’t Altria’s shareholders and investors expect the company to continue to pay judgment in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in the years to come? Thank you.
Marty Barrington
Thank you for your question Mr. Sweda. Welcome back to the meeting, it’s nice to see you here again. I am also pleased to know that someone reached to 10-K after all the works that we put into it with the care that you do, so thank you. The litigation is described there very comprehensively I think and very clearly. Litigation presents risk, it presents risks to this company and to others. But it is also true that we have considerable experience in managing that risk. And I think if you look at the track record for Altria, and fill it more so over the years, you see that it has been extremely well managed. The approach we take is to defend the cases strongly and vigorously and you overwhelmingly see that from time-to-time, no matter may present itself in which we have a unique opportunity to resolve the matter. And if we think it’s in shareholders’ best interest to do that, we will go ahead to do that, but I think actually if you look at the curve of tobacco litigation over the last, I don’t know, 7 to 10 years, you will see that it is not up at all. In fact, it is sharply down. And I think that’s because we have managed it and we have addressed the challenges that we have had in litigation that you are pointing out. So, again, welcome back to the meeting and thank your for your questions. Yes, sir. I will go here.
Justin Flores
Good morning.
Marty Barrington
Good morning.
Justin Flores
My name is Justin Flores, Vice President of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee. And I have been participating in the FLPG meetings that were referenced. I first want to say that I think Altria possibly more so than any other company has put a lot of effort into the FLPG and we think that represents a good first step. We wanted to share a frustration at the FLPG that I think – that our members share that I think comes from the fact that it’s been 3 years and certainly the tobacco farm workers have not seen any real change in conditions, wages, housing things of that nature out in the field. I think that comes from the sort of circular problem which is that most of the companies would like to put all the efforts into the FLPG as a multi-stakeholder group, but at the same time real changes in the way the company buys tobacco can’t happen there, because then I trust considerations. So, it kind of feels like we are sort of being bounced around a little bit. There is really good conversation in the FLPG, but no real way to make change in the way the company buys tobacco.
And with that in mind in October of 2014, our President, Baldemar Velasquez sent in a proposed Memorandum of Understanding as Michael mentioned to ask Altria to sign agreement that would really make a real change in the way that tobacco is purchased by Altria to guarantee certain labor rights in the supply chain. I have a copy of that and similarly would like to get it to you and ask a similar question if there is particular contact person that you recommend that we seek with about this Memorandum of Understanding, which I think has the very serious potential to end lot of the problems that we see in the supply chain.
Marty Barrington
Okay, thank you very much for those comments, Mr. Flores and welcome to our meeting. I will see that the usher gets that in the right hands and we will have someone to get back to you. We have members of our corporate responsibility team, members of our leaf buying team, members of our procurement organization, all of whom I know have been active with the Farm Labor Practices Group. Again, I don’t want to repeat the comments I made earlier about it except to observe that we believe in the rights of association for workers. We simply do not employ the individuals about whom you are speaking. They are employed by the growers. We have made it clear to our growers what we expect in that regard, but we can’t compel them to do much of what I think has been called for by the initiative, but that’s not to say that more progress can’t be made and we are happy to talk about some more and I will make sure that the materials you have given get in the right hands. Thank you again for your comment. I will go over here. Good morning, sir.
Julian Martinez
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. My name is Julian Martinez. And I represent SER-Jobs for Progress, a national non-profit community based organization serving the economic needs of Hispanic Americans. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Altria for commitments to Latino community from its diverse Board of Directors to programs in the value we have proven yourselves to be leading Corporate America in diversity, especially in serving the Latino community. It helps [indiscernible] Latino serving on your Board of Directors who is very involved in giving back. We appreciate your participation in Hispanic association on corporate responsibility, corporate inclusion index. Altria has increased its ratings since the very rating survey from 50 in 2009 to 70 in 2014. As you know, the Hispanic population is increasing dramatically. This means company is harnessed to power the Hispanic community and employ as they mean just the same their competitive edge in an ever changing economy. The continued under-representation and key positions throughout Corporate America means companies are not leveraging this talent to the fullest potential.
Corporate America needs to understand the work that must be done to increase the pipeline of Hispanics into the upper ranks of Corporate America and to further develop the Hispanic entrepreneur and middle class. It is truly a pleasure to see Altria leading the way? Thank you.
Marty Barrington
Mr. Martinez, thank you very much for those comments and welcome to the meeting, we are always glad to have you here. We share our commitment to diversity and inclusion you heard speak about it in our remarks this morning. There is always more to do, but were very, very proud of the efforts all of our employees are making, our Board of Directors is making, our executive team is making. We are trying to create a work culture where everyone is welcome. Everyone is welcome and they are challenged to contribute. And I thank you again for your remarks. Yes sir, over here.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, Mr. Barrington. My name is Howard [indiscernible] and I live up in the Fredericksburg area. My question to you today is what is Altria doing to reduce the illegal trafficking of tobacco products out of the State of Virginia?
Marty Barrington
Thank you very much for your comments and thank you for travelling to the meeting, I am glad you here. We actually are working very hard on that. You may know that we have an entire department that we call Brand Integrity that works on this. We are opposed to the kind of trafficking that you are making reference to. We have worked extremely closely with Virginia law enforcement and others. We helped them develop cases. We teach them how to distinguish contraband and counterfeit products and genuine products. And we have worked with our trade partners to try to protect there legitimate trade. It does no one any good to have cigarettes move the cross borders. Unfortunately this has been created by some states particularly New York State where they have raised the excise taxes to a point that it has incented this kind of criminal behavior. We oppose it and we have worked very hard on it. We have quite a long section on altria.com and there was also a chapter in our corporate responsibility report if memory serves on all of the efforts which I have just given you sort of a high level view of. So perhaps you could refer there for more detail. But we are opposed to it and we were working on it. Thank you again for your question. Yes sir.
Michael Crosby
Mr. Barrington, my name is Michael Crosby. I am Capuchin Franciscan brother from Milwaukee. And I would like to address this for you, but I would like to really talk to the shareholders, because everyone of our dividends is in hands like undocumented workers, which involve illegality. Mr. Barrington, you just responded to the previous question that you are against illegal trafficking of tobacco products. This company does not seem to be that much against illegal trafficking of human beings who are coming into our fields to produce and harvest the tobacco. You called the trafficking of tobacco products criminal behavior, for me its criminal behavior when this company is aware of the illegality of having so many undocumented workers, some people say up to 70% of all farm workers in the United States are undocumented, that means this company is involved in illegal behavior maybe not directly, but indirectly it knows it’s going on and doesn’t do anything, so there scope up ability. This is the elephant in the board room. This is the elephant in the shareholders meeting that our dividends are coming on the back of illegal activities, I know this going to be our shareholders resolution but I would really like you in this venue to say what is the difference at the prior end to have what I consider illegal activities enabling farm workers to come across the border to harvest the products that were used than the illegal activities of the products that are crossing state boundaries, what’s the difference around illegality and criminal behavior when the United States government says it is against both of these, but it seems on the one you are working against it strongly, but on the other and I am not talking currently of your practices group because that’s sort of happens when they get to the farm. I am talking about what happens to get across the border to the farm. What’s the difference and what’s the percentage of worker that you think are undocumented that are working in our fields, because you got to have a insight and if you say you don’t I don’t think that’s honest.
Marty Barrington
I understand the thrust of your question and your time is expired a bit. So, let me move on and spur it. We oppose the use of exploitive or forced labor. And we say that and more than that we do something about it.
Michael Crosby
[Question Inaudible]
Marty Barrington
I want to give you a chance to speak if you could let me to try to respond to the question you posed to me and then if there is time you can ask a follow-up. I just want to make sure that shareholders understand what the facts are. The facts are that we oppose exploiting labor on the farm or elsewhere. We opposed forced labor. We say so. I would refer you to our website. I would refer you to our corporate responsibility report and we describe there Father, the steps that we have taken. So, with all due respect, it is not accurate to suggest that we have done something wrong or that we haven’t taken steps we have. We have put it in our supplier code of conduct. We tell the growers that they should not be using forced labor or exploitive labor on our work. We put it in our supplier code of conduct and then we audit against that expectation and we audit with our own people and we audit with third-parties. We have done work at the Farm Labor Practices Group. You are probably also familiar that the use of the kind of labor that you are referring to is also illegal under the United States Tobacco Good Agricultural Practices guideline. And who is at the forefront of getting that developed with many others, it was Altria. So, I am sorry, it’s just not accurate to suggest that we haven’t done anything in this regard, I appreciate the problem. Altria appreciates the problem. Immigration is a big problem. But to suggest that Altria is somehow complicit in that, I am sorry it’s just not accurate. And on behalf of Altria, I have to say I respectfully disagree with you. So, thank you for coming and sharing your perspective. Yes, sir.
Michael Spock
Mr. Chairman, Michael Spock again.
Marty Barrington
Yes, welcome back.
Michael Spock
Yes. First of all, I wanted to say that Altria’s treatment and respect for freedom of association of its manufacturing workers is great. And we are very thankful for that, for your attitude as a company, but the reality is that there is no process. There is no NLRB that covers agricultural workers. So, unless a process is created, then the workers don’t in fact have a mechanism through which the tobacco farm workers who are working on contract farms do not have that mechanism to choose a union. And again my question was Mr. Chairman, can you provide the child labor coalition with a contact at Altria with whom we can discuss the issues that have been raised in the letter that has been sent to you?
Marty Barrington
Yes, sir. Thank you for following up. The answer is yes, we will and I committed to that in my reply to Mr. Flores and we will make sure that you get that name promptly. Okay.
Michael Spock
At Reynolds, they have a clock that goes if there is 2 minutes, light over there, so sorry.
Marty Barrington
Thank you very much for that observation and thank you for coming to the meeting. Alright, everybody. Everyone should please now return to their seats. And we will now hear presentations on three. I am sorry, I didn’t mean to go past you, ma’am. I apologize.
Cathy Rowan
I am sorry, Mr. Barrington, just a very quick question….
Marty Barrington
No, no take your time I am sorry I didn’t see you.
Cathy Rowan
My name is Cathy Rowan.
Marty Barrington
Yes, welcome back.
Cathy Rowan
Thank you. You had mentioned immigration and forgive me if you have made a statement publicly or previously, what is your position on immigration reform?
Marty Barrington
Yes, actually our government affairs team is pretty active in working on that issue. Immigration is a big public policy issue. As you know, it’s being worked on in the Congress of the United States. We are having a certain interest. For example, it’s important to us that we have access to certain skilled labor, so the Visa program needs reform and so we have been working to make sure that we are covered in that regard. So, as we have discussed this morning already, there is lots of work that could be done with respect to the agricultural workers. So, it’s not core to our business, but it’s one of the issues that’s in the public sector that relates to our ability to get talent and to source our product and that’s how we have been doing it to our government affairs operation. Okay, sorry again for cutting you off. I didn’t see you. Okay. Alright, Brandt, can we go now?
Brandt Surgner
Yes.
Marty Barrington
Alright, now I can go. Alright. We will now hear presentations on three shareholder proposals, included in the proxy statement and then we will vote on them if they are properly presented. We believe shareholders should vote against these proposals for the reasons set forth fully in the proxy statement. So, in the interest of time, I won’t elaborate on our views today that we encourage all shareholders to read the proposals and our responses. Proponents should first identify themselves and please limit their presentation to 4 minutes or less and each speaker commenting on the proposal to two minutes or less will about no more than eight minutes to each proposal as before our lighting system will help us manage our time and thank you and again for your cooperation, so lighting system up the clock. Alright. Well, the representative from Province of St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order for Proposal 6, please present the proposal.

Yes Mr. Barrington. I am a member of the Province of St. Joseph Group of Franciscan priests and brothers and I happened to be a priest. I am against sin, but we are all sinners. When you say Mr. Barrington you are against forced labor and exploited labor and that you have independent monitoring to support your position and yet everybody knows that 70% of farm workers in the United States and that would not exclude tobacco farm workers are undocumented and illegal there is a disconnect, there is disassociation going on. And when this disassociation anybody can look at data and say this is what is true, whether the people say find ways to say, well I won’t do with it. Finally at the farm labor practices group at the last meeting after we filed our shareholder resolution with all three the tobacco companies and the tobacco growers Altria I mean Alliance One and Universal Leaf, we finally said we are going to address this issue at the front end of the undocumented workers coming part of immigration reform that everybody knows is dealing with undocumented workers, we are benefiting as the company from undocumented workers, that’s what our resolution is asking you in your concerns not in your pocket book. This is a moral question, do I have the right to have dividends coming from illegal activity of exploitation because one of those workers coming has been exploited because 58% as we say in our shareholders resolution have had to pay some kind of fees to get across the border. Immigration reform has been obstructed by republicans and this company is probably what 80%, 90% of all its donations are going to republicans undermining immigration reform. So there is disconnect all over the place and I guess what I would like given your response to me earlier is just for us to admit it’s a huge problem.
And let’s find ways politically, corporately, industry wide to make it right for our brothers and sisters who are exploited, so that our pocket books aren’t expanded on that exploitation. That’s all we are asking and we would – once we get to the farm labor practices group, once they are at the place, I think the company and the others are doing the best we can, but that elephant in the board room is what happens on the way to get here, that’s the issue that this resolution asks you to support. And so I conclude by asking you vote your conscious, not your pocket book or along with your pocket book. Thank you.
Marty Barrington
Thank you, Father. Are there any comments on the proposal? We have a comment here, yes Mr. Sweda.
Edward Sweda
Thank you, Mr. Barrington. I just sort of underscore also relatively last resolution is in terms of the specific require to have the company’s Board of Directors create a policy that all of the suppliers throughout the tobacco procurement supply chain verify with independent monitoring which is quite important. Verify their commitment and compliance regarding non-employment directly or indirectly of labors who have the pay to cross the U.S. border to work or once a year to work on U.S. farms. And I know when the response of the company describes what it has been done but what I have not seen and maybe somewhere else that on the website or elsewhere, but has there any measurable progress that the company come point to regarding any efforts to address this problem because the status quo currently is still way out of whack with what’s legal and it’s certainly way out of the whack with what is moral. So, obviously I agree with Father Crosby on the basic point that everyone in this room is against forced labor and can state that, but the actions needed to change the status quo need to be greatly increased. This resolution is quite modest and frankly at this point of that, the company officially came out in opposition to it. Thank you.
Marty Barrington
Thank you for those comments. Are there other comments on this proposal? Alright, those shareholders in the room wishing to vote on this proposal should please do so now, well, the representative from Trinity Health for Proposal 7, please present the proposal.
Cathy Rowan
Thank you. Good morning again, Mr. Barrington.
Marty Barrington
Welcome back.
Cathy Rowan
Thanks. Members of the board and fellow shareholders my name is Cathy Rowan representing Trinity Health. And along with Catholic Health Initiatives, the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, New Jersey, the Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth and the Sisters of St. Francis are proponents of Proposal 7, which asks our board to initiate efforts to develop materials informing tobacco users to live below the poverty line or have little formal education about the health consequences of smoking our product along with market appropriate smoking cessation materials. We appreciate the efforts Altria has made to support programs and practices to reduce underage tobacco use as well as new initiatives to strengthen its criticism website.
Our proposal however speaks to the high prevalence of smoking among people living in poverty, people with disabilities and minority populations. Many of these are fellow citizens are people who have the fewest resources, the least amount of social support and the least access to cessation services. As the Centers for Disease Control has said, the high smoking prevalence observed among some population groups underscores the need for enhanced implementation and reach of proven strategies to prevent and reduce tobacco use among these groups. And our company website states and I really appreciate this statement we believe that responsibility is defined by the actions a company takes to address society’s expectations.
I think we have all become more aware in our country of the reality of income in quality as part of our national debate today. There is a growing expectation in society to address inequality in whatever ways we are capable. We believe shareholder proponents believe that reducing ethnic and racial disparities in tobacco related health conditions is a national public health priority that could have positive effect for our economy and our society as a whole. Expanding Altria’s corporate responsibility to take the actions suggested by our proposal would be a real demonstration of leadership. And I urge our fellow shareholders to support our proposal. Thank you.
Marty Barrington
Thank you very much for your comments. Are there comments on the proposal?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. I would like to just tell a couple of stories that would support this. [Indiscernible] Milwaukee is downtown. We are serving today 300 to 500 people a meal in the evening. Our headquarters is in the east side, near east side a very rough area and we are serving 1,500 to 2,000 meals today. The majority of our guests are either low income and/or less educated. And all the data is showing that these are the highest numbers of smokers. So, it would seem to me that if we can exploit lower educated and lower income people, we then would have a parallel responsibility to try to do something to figure out what is it that makes such people smoke and use our products.
Just one concrete example, I was outside on our parking lot and there was a young woman with two little kids and her husband was awake and she was smoking in front of those kids and something you may just resolve. And I went up and said, ma’am, we ask you not to smoke in front of your children. She said I have the right to do what I want. I said you may, but not on this property. You are not allowed to smoke in front of your children on this property. We don’t see anything about people who are adult who smoke in front of each other, that’s an adult choice. So as children are exploited by the smoking that women thinks it’s her right, not the right of the children that not unjust for him to smoke and to have their consecutive health problems as a result. This resolution is very minimal it’s just saying find a way to address this problem since this problem is benefiting us because the majority in terms of anyone group of our smokers are this group. So let’s make sure that again in concern we are doing the right thing. So I support this resolution.
Marty Barrington
Thank you Father. Are there other comments on this proposal? Alright, those shareholders in the room wishing to vote on this proposal should please do so now. And with the representative from AFL-CIO for proposal eight, please present the proposal.
Justin Flores
Yes. My name is Justin Flores of Farm Labor Organizing Committee. I would like to speak in support of proposal eight. This is a proposal to protect both Altria and the farm workers in the Altria supply chain from the devastating effects of green tobacco sickness or GTS. The proposal is carefully crafted to help Altria to deal with the issue and ask for a report on the steps of the company as taken to reduce GTS reform presents supply chain with – most importantly with a quantitative summary of the methods and results of the company’s inspection of the suppliers. And I spend most of time in there in the tobacco season out in labor camps speaking with farm workers about issues. And I can tell you that health and safety, GTS and each stroke are very important to our membership. We are very much aware that they are some serious labor abuses going on in the tobacco supply chain. And this is certainly isn’t Altria’s fault though we believe Altria can do a lot to improving conditions for the men and women that provide tobacco to the company. But first we need to realize the assessment of what’s going on, on the ground. So we can discuss openly honestly how to deal with it. The Board’s statements against this proposal was – it’s been a one page summary of some of the steps that the company is taking with green tobacco sickness that mainly focuses on training growers with the hopes that that training will circle down and really effect it’s going on in the ground. But we need a real assessment of what’s going on beyond sort of cosmetic approaches that can provide some real transparency to what’s going on, on the ground.
One example is that the phrase personal protection equipment PPE is referenced a lot on the website and some of the materials. But there is no statement on what that means. Tobacco farmer because I know take a garage bag as they bought with their own money, they cut a hole on the top, hole on the sides and they put it on as a poncho and that’s really be only protective equipment that anybody gives them to work in tobacco that protects from GTS. I am not sure from the materials I have seen if that qualifies, what that means that grower is in compliance because those garbage bags are on those workers. I think we really need to take a look honestly about what’s going on, how the audits are being done, what the results are, what the flaws are and how we can correct them. And our membership and our union is very willing and very interested in working with Altria to improve the assessment and to improve the conditions and the health and safety in your supply chain. I think this proposal is a good first step and so we will just vote in favor of this proposal.
Marty Barrington
