This Robotic Spider Dress Will Make Your Skin Crawl

As if spiders weren't creepy enough on their own, now you can wear one. High-tech fashion designer Anouk Wipprecht created an unsettling robotic spider dress, complete with animatronic arachnid limbs that jerk and twitch. 
Teaming up with Austrian software developer and hacker, Daniel Schatzmayr, Wipprecht makes hexapods haute. The dress has six robotic legs on its shoulder pads which respond to nearby movement. 
If anyone gets too close, the limbs move in closer to protect the wearer and keep strangers at bay (because everyone wants to snuggle up to someone decked out like an insect). Check out the video, above, for more.  
The Dutch-based designer showcased her dress at Cafe Neu Romance, an international robot performance festival in Prague, in November 2012. On her bio page, Wipprecht describes herself as "part futuristic, part anime-meets-high fashion" and pushes the boundaries between the physical and psychological. 
With the Spider Dress, Wipprecht explores the ideas of personal space, control and privacy. She describes it as a "cute little host creature" in her YouTube video, where warped voices set the track for the spider legs in action.

Her other out-of-the-ordinary designs include dresses with plastic tubes, fluids, inks and smart foils. The Daredroid is a cocktail-making robot dress, while Wipprecht's Intimacy line features dresses that become transparent based on the wearer's sensual interactions. The e-foils on Intimacy dresses respond to the person's heartbeat.
