Redditor icheban has now rendered all of our doodles insignificant. 
Using just an iPhone 4S, the app Brushes and a finger, icheban has created charming and fanciful paintings. Check out the gallery above to see some of the creations that include futuristic birds and whimsical cats with ice cream cones. 
The video below is a time lapse showing how the artist created one of the images, which he says took about 90 minutes to produce. 

And icheban also owns it on DrawSomething, but welcomes adding you as an opponent to prove his chops. Good luck winning that one, all other human beings.
