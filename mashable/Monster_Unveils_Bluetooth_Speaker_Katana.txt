The company also unveiled a new line of headphones, as well as one for gaming with a partnership alongside EA Sports. It also revealed inspiration headbands, which allow users to attach spikes and feathers.
"I believe that in order to market in 2013 you have to have a combination of three elements â€” we call it a menage a trios," Monster CEO Noel Lee said during a press conference. "It's a fusion of fashion, entertainment/fashion and technology. We learned that from Beats. You will see this combination from us on steroids. This is the marketing that has to happen this year and beyond."
