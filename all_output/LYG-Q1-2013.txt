Thanks for standing by, and welcome to the Lloyds Banking Group 2013 Q1 IMS Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is scheduled for 1 hour. I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, 30th of April, 2013. The speakers today are António Horta-Osório and George Culmer. I will turn the conference over to António. Please go ahead.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 results call. I will begin by giving you an overview of the further strong progress we have made on our strategy.
Turning to Slide 1, for those of you who are following the website's presentation. We have delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, with significant progress in many key areas despite the challenging environment. Profits, both at group level and in the core business, have improved substantially. At the same time, our net interest margin increased, as we expected; and cost and impairments continue to fall.
Importantly, our core loan book returned to growth in the first quarter earlier than we expected. This was driven by growth in lending to business clients, providing further evidence of our support for the U.K. economic recovery. So the momentum we built in 2012 has continued and increased into the first quarter. And in a number of areas, we now expect to deliver ahead of the guidance we set at the year end results as you will hear soon.
I have spoken before about our very strong core franchise. And we further increased profitability in the quarter, driven by increased cost efficiencies and a further reduction in impairments. Our core returns remain substantially above the cost of equity. We have also continued to make substantial reductions to our noncore portfolio, with a GBP 9 billion reduction on a constant-currency basis for the first quarter or GBP 6 billion after currency effects. And as you have seen, we have made further progress since the quarter end, with the agreement to sell our Spanish Retail operations to Banco Sabadell, which we announced yesterday, reducing noncore assets by a further GBP 1.5 billion.
As regards to capital, we remain confident in our capital position, as we have a strongly capital-generative business and have further strengthened our capital generation, driven by our core underlying profitability and also the sale of a 20% stake in St. James's Place.
We continue to address legacy issues, as you will hear from George. And on PPI, we have seen a substantial fall in compliance volume as expected.
On Verde, we are disappointed that the Co-operative Group decided that they can no longer proceed with the purchase of the business given their view of regulatory and economic circumstances. As a result, we are now progressing towards an IPO, our plan B, and an option we have maintained from the outset.
Turning now to an overview of financial performance on Slide 2. Compared to the first quarter of last year, we delivered a substantial increase in underlying profits, from GBP 500 million to GBP 1.5 billion, which includes a gain of around GBP 400 million from the sale of a 20% stake in St. James's Place. Similarly, statutory profit increased from GBP 280 million to GBP 2 billion, including around GBP 780 million of gains on further gilt sales.
We saw a further increase in the net interest margin of 2 basis points to 196% in the quarter, and we remain on track to reach our target of around 198% for the full year. We have reduced group costs by 6% compared to last year, and we saw a run rate savings from Simplification increase to over GBP 1 billion by the end of the quarter. And group impairments fell by 40% and noncore impairments fell by 59%.
These significant improvements have been primarily driven by our progress in reducing the noncore book ahead of trend. Group returns improved substantially, as a result. And core returns remained significantly above our cost of equity.
Turning now to the balance sheet on Slide 3. Our customer deposits continue to grow with our group's loan-to-deposit ratio falling 2 percentage points to 119%, now below the 2014 target set out at the strategic review. And the core ratio has now reached our revised target of 100% as set out last year.
On noncore assets, with the progress we have seen in the quarter, we remain confident of achieving our target of a reduction of, at least, GBP 20 billion in 2013 and now expect to comfortably meet our target of GBP 70 billion or less by the end of 2014 with less than GBP 35 billion in non-retail assets and then in a capital-accretive way.
We remain a strongly capital-generative business. In the first quarter, our core tier 1 ratio improved to 12.5%. And on a fully loaded basis, we generated 60 basis points of capital, offsetting the impact in January this year from the change in pension accounting rules, leaving our fully loaded ratio unchanged at 8.1%.
Turning now to Slide 4 and the support we are giving to our customers and the U.K. economy. I highlighted earlier that we grew our core loan book in the first quarter ahead of expectations, and that this growth was primarily driven by lending to our business clients. We continue to support the U.K. economy through a number of government schemes, and we're pleased with the government's decision to extend the Funding for Lending by a year to January 2015. The government see Funding for Lending as a key way to help small- and medium-sized businesses, which are at the heart of the British economy. And our strategy is aligned to this.
One specific example is our support of small and midsized clients in the manufacturing sector, where having achieved GBP 700 million in total in the last 6 months, we now expect to exceed our targets of GBP 1 billion of lending by September as we are running ahead of plan.
In SMEs, over the last 12 months, our lending has grown 4% against the market, which contracted 4%. And so far this year, we have supported more than 32,000 startups. In retail, we continue to be the U.K.'s largest lender to first-time buyers, providing 1 in 4 with mortgages. We remain committed to helping 60,000 customers buy their first home in 2013 and made good progress towards this goal in the first quarter. We also announced recently that we will further support customers through our participation in the help-to-buy scheme that was outlined in the 2013 budget, which we believe will be an important stimulus for the housing market and the construction sector.
In summary, we remain committed to going further to help our customers and to help breathe [ph] and prosper. We delivered on this in both 2011 and 2012. And the initiatives I have just outlined show that we are continuing to do so and more in 2013.
And now, I will hand you over to George to consider the financials in more detail.
Mark George Culmer
Thanks, Antonio, and good morning, everyone. As already mentioned and as shown on Slide 5, we delivered a substantial improvement in performance in the first 3 months of 2013, with a GBP 1 billion increase include underlying profit to GBP 1.5 billion. This reflects a 19% increase in core profits to GBP 1.9 billion, including GBP 0.4 billion from the partial sale of St. James's Place and a 64% reduction in noncore losses to GBP 392 million.
Statutory profit before tax increased by GBP 1.8 billion to GBP 2 billion, driven by the increase in underlying profit and asset sales and volatile items of GBP 1.1 billion. Asset sales and gilt gains of sales of government securities of GBP 776 million, and we've now completed the reposition of our gilt portfolio and don't expect a material level of gilt sales going forward.
Volatile items include positive effects of insurance volatility caused by movements in financial markets. This settled GBP 462 million, largely reflecting the rise in equity markets in the period. Also, included in statutory profit were Verde and Simplification costs of GBP 409 million. Verde costs in the first quarter were GBP 195 million, while Simplification spend was GBP 214 million. We've now realized run rate savings of over GBP 1 billion from Simplification with a ratio of spend to savings achieved almost 1:1.
Looking at drivers of underlying profit on Slide 6, core income in the first quarter was GBP 4.6 billion, up 7% year-on-year. This includes a GBP 394 million gain from SJP, which also drove the 15% increase in core other income.
Excluding the SJP gain, core other income was 6% lower than Q1 last year, although down just 3% on Q4 2012, excluding insurance claims, with continued growth in commercial banking offset by the Q4 benefit of insurance assumption changes. Core net interest income was stable compared with Q1 2012 as the impact of the 3% reduction in average interest in the assets over the year was mostly offset by the 2 basis points improvement in net interest margin, which was 234 for the core; and when combined with the 44 basis points on noncore, gives 196 for the group as a whole.
On Slide 7, we have set out the drivers of margin in more detail. The positive trend in group and core reflects the benefit of improved deposit margin, primarily driven by the repricing of Retail deposits and online deposits as well as Asset Finance and International. It's more than offset lower asset margins and the expected lower returns, our structural hedge or from lower income as a result of the government bond sales. As I said at the year end, we expect the structural hedge and the gilts to have a negative effect on group margin of around 6 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively, in the 2013 full year.
Turning briefly on costs on Slide 8. We delivered a reduction of 6% in total costs driven by savings for our Simplification program where run rate savings surpassed the GBP 1 billion mark, an increase of GBP 160 million since the start of the year.
We're updating our full year cost guidance and now expect costs to be around GBP 9.6 billion for 2013 compared with previous guidance from GBP 9.8 billion, driven by further cost savings and the effects of deconsolidation of St. James's Place, which will reduce cost by around GBP 0.1 billion.
We're now also targeting a further cost reductions of around GBP 9.15 billion in 2014, reflecting Simplification and other savings and assuming subject to regulatory approvals of midyear IPO of Verde.
Our impairments on Slide 9 in 2012, our prudent risk appetite, and strong management controls continue to drive an improvement in portfolio and asset quality. And group impairments of GBP 1 billion were down 40% year-on-year. This is mainly driven by the 59% decrease in noncore impairment with substantial reductions in Commercial Banking and International portfolios.
For the core, we saw a 14% reduction compared to the fourth quarter of last year. While the increase, compared with Q1 2012, was primarily attributable to a provision release in Commercial Banking in the first quarter of last year.
In terms of AQR for the group, this reduced to 80 basis points, while the core remains low at around 50 basis points and at the lower end of our long-term target for the group.
On PPI on Slide 10, we have taken no further provision in the first quarter. The volume of PPI complaints has continued to fall, in line with expectations with average week complaints now running at approximately 15,000. This is down 28% on Q4 and is more than halved from Q2 last year.
Total costs incurred in Q1 were GBP 586 million, including approximately GBP 180 million of related expenses. We now expect costs in the first half to be marginally higher than thought at the year end. This is due to the acceleration on our initiative of the settlement case that's currently held with the Financial Ombudsman Service and some one-off VAT payments. As previously said, we continue to expect monthly costs to decline in the second half of the year.
Moving on to balance sheet on Slide 11. We continue to hold a strong balance sheet. And during the quarter, we continue to grow deposits, reduce our noncore assets and utilize surplus liquidity to further reduce wholesale funding by GBP 8 billion and repay GBP 8 billion of our LTRO funding for the European Central Bank.
Looking at the noncore reduction in more detail on Slide 12. During Q1, as you heard, we delivered a further reduction of noncore assets of GBP 9 billion of currency exchange or GBP 6 billion after effects, of which nearly GBP 0.5 billion was from impairment. This reduction was again achieved in a capital-accretive manner. This decrease was primarily driven by a disposal of nonretail assets and comprised reductions of GBP 3 billion in treasury assets; GBP 2 billion in U.K. commercial real estate; and around GBP 0.5 billion each in our Irish asset finance, acquisition finance and shipping portfolios.
We continue to reduce the risk profile of the noncore portfolio, and a 16% reduction in nonretail RWAs exceeded 10% reduction in assets. And for the noncore portfolio, as a whole, the fall in RWAs is 10%, and again, in excess of the 6% fall in assets.
We remain on track to achieve our noncore reduction of, at least, GBP 20 billion in 2013, and our target of a noncore asset portfolio of GBP 70 billion or less by the end of 2014 with less than GBP 35 billion of that being non-retail assets.
Now that brings us to capital on Slide 13. During the first quarter, our core tier 1 capital ratio increased by 50 basis points to 12.5%, while the fully loaded ratio was stable at 8.1%. These are strong performance given that both of these ratios were impacted by the implementation of IAS 19, as we flagged at the year end. Both of our ratios benefited from our improved profitability, as well as from the reduction in risk-weighted assets, mostly from noncore and the St. James's Place share sale.
Whilst the financial policy committee has stated that major U.K. banks and building societies and aggregate capital shortfall at end 2012 around GBP 25 billion, we are waiting the outcome of the consideration of the FPC's recommendations by a potential regulatory authority board. Given our strongly capital-generative core business and continued progress in increasing capital and reducing risks through noncore asset disposals, we have continued to be confident in our capital position.
And with this strong capital generation, we're now guiding to a fully loaded core tier 1 ratio in excess of 9% by the end of 2013, an excess of 10% by the end of 2014, and so we're meeting regulatory requirements well ahead of time.
That completes my review of financials. And I'd now like to hand back to António.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Thank you, George. So in summary, the group's underlying performance in the first 3 months improved substantially, and we continue to deliver ahead of plan in a number of key areas.
The progress we have made on the noncore reduction in this and previous periods has meant that our group results increasingly reflect the strong profitability of our core franchise, while returns remain above the group's cost of equity. And I remain confident in our capital position given the strongly capital-generative nature of our business and of our strategy.
Overall, the momentum we built in 2012 has continued, and indeed, accelerated in the first quarter of 2013. So what does this mean for our guidance? We are on track to meet our existing guidance for 2013. And due to significant progress in 3 key areas, as George already mentioned, we have today, strengthening guidance.
Firstly, and as you have heard already, our core loan book returned to growth in quarter 1, 6 months ahead of plan. This was driven by continued positive SME lending and growth in lending to midsized and larger corporates, which more than offset an expected decrease in the mortgage book. I expect this to continue, and also expect mortgage lending to turn positive in quarter 3 as previously announced.
With regards to capital, we are now targeting a fully loaded core tier 1 ratio of about 9% by the end of the year, and over and above 10% by the end of next year. Our guidance on total costs for 2013 is now GBP 9.6 billion, driven by further cost savings and the deconsolidation of St. James's Place. And we are also giving new guidance for cost in the full year 2014, which we now expect to be around GBP 9.15 billion, assuming an IPO of Verde at the midyear.
Overall, this means we will deliver nearly GBP 2 billion of cost savings by the end of 2014 versus our total costs in 2010, GBP 1 billion more than we outlined at the time of our strategic review. And together, these 3 areas of improved guidance further underline my confidence in delivering on our medium-term financial targets.
Thank you. This concludes our presentation, and I would like to open the line up to any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Helsby of Bank of America.
Michael Helsby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Just one question from me, actually. Just a bit of a  confirmation on your cost guidance, because I'm just conscious that it includes a half-year contribution from Verde. And that we all, I think, stripped Verde out from the whole of 2014. So I was wondering if you could tell us what the cost number would be relative to your GBP 9.15 billion if we exclude Verde all together, that gives me a base of 2015?
Mark George Culmer
Michael, this is George. Yes, you're right. We assumed that the GBP 9.15 billion that, that's the sort of midyear IPO, as I said in the presentation. And the answer is [indiscernible] entirety, you'll be around about a 9 number.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Michael, we should add that, as you say so and as George just said, so we have considered Verde by midyear, which just to complement your question, has an impact on both cost and income. So in the same way that it would represent GBP 150 million of costs for the total for the whole of 2014, it would represent as well GBP 300 million of additional revenues versus the previous scenario. So that is, more or less, what we have said about Verde, that Verde on the full [ph] 2014 year, would have revenues of around GBP 600 million and costs of around GBP 300 million and impairments, I believe, was around GBP 100 million.

Your next question comes from Chris Manners of Morgan Stanley.
Chris Manners - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So I had just a couple of questions for you. The first one was on the impairment charge to be a lot better than, I guess, some people are anticipating. Just wondering which areas did well in the quarter and as I look to your guidance, the GBP 1 billion charge was around 80 basis points, you're saying 50 to 60 basis points for the next year. So would that mean we would be expecting an absolute terms of impairment charge number of less than GBP 3 billion a quid?  Is that around about what your guidance means? And the second one was on the FEC capital exercise. Obviously -- and Andrew Bailey is saying that U.K. bank still had a capital gap of about GBP 12.5 billion on the plans that he'd seen when he had the press conference. Just wondering if -- do you guys think that you have a capital gap on your current plans and there are other things that you've come up with since that announcement, that would mean that -- to close that gap?
Mark George Culmer
Chris, it's George here. So I guess, in your first part -- in terms of impairment, which is pretty good across the board actually when I look across the divisions, and I look sort of Q1 of Q1, I think Retail is about there or thereabouts in terms of same absolute amount. Commercial Banks, as we called out in the presentation, is up Q1 versus Q1 but that was in Q1 of last year. We had a collective release of about GBP 79 million, so that sort of flatted Commercial Bank's Q1 ratio. But we are seeing good trends right across the business in terms of the core book. And on the noncore, why don't you comment along?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
So the way I would look at it is [indiscernible], the way I would look at it is the core book is performing in a flattish trend in around the 40, 50 basis points if you look at AQRs in the last quarters. The noncore performance, I think it's a combination of 2 things. One is the fact that the type of sales that we have been prioritizing in the last years have been focused on derisking the portfolio as fast as possible. And then this is now showing a lower AQR quarter-after-quarter. And the second thing that you're seeing is the fat reduction of the noncore book. So all combined is that the total AQR of the bank is dropping every quarter.
Mark George Culmer
I mean -- and on the sort of fully [indiscernible], I think we haven't given any explicit guidance in terms of impairments and in terms of absolute numbers. But I certainly would say that I would expect to see a continuation of the good trends that we've seen in Q1. So we haven't given explicit bit [ph].  And on your third -- on FTC. So as we said in the press release, and in my presentation, Chris, yes, we'll await the outcome. We know that the FPC came up with, or rather, the FSA come up with a recommendation around GBP 25 billion in terms of the 2012. We know that -- I think some of the projections in terms of the 2013 have been relooked at, I think is probably the best way of describing it, by PRA. So they came up with that GBP 25 million. I think that the PRA Board is working with each of the individual companies as we speak, but I'm afraid I can't give to you any line of sight in terms of what specific numbers might be or when we actually would receive that information. So that is the current situation. What it means for us, though, is that we carry on, and we carry on delivering the capital, sort of generative strategies. So as you've seen from the stats today, in terms of growth of the core tier 1 and in terms of the fully loaded, having capital actions has offset that 60 basis points impact of IAS 19 coming up, so the group continues to throw off significant capital. And I think it's quite important the guidance we've given out today, that we expect to move on that fully loaded basis from an 8.1% to an excess of 9% by the end of this year. And we've also said that we expect to be in excess of 10% by the end of 2014. So as you understand it, the PRA are working through the numbers and what it means. And I think they're reviewing some of that 2013 outlook. But what matters for us, as I said, is that we continue to throw off, and we continue to be capital generative.

Your next question comes from Andrew Coombs of Citigroup.
Andrew P. Coombs - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I have 3 questions on the core revenues, please. Firstly, just looking at the core NII, the average interest-earning assets were down 1% Q-on-Q. They're resulting in a bit of decline in core NII despite the better margin. But given the core loan growth in Q1, the 1 basis point improvement in the core NIM, presumably, which should be returned to core NII growth from 2Q onward. My second question was just with regards to the core OOI, GBP 1.9 billion if you exclude the gain on St. James's Place. And I think you mentioned that was down Q-on-Q due to insurance to some changes and down year-on-year due to lower bank insurance income, but perhaps you could elaborate a bit more there? And then the final question, I just wanted to ask, you mentioned Help to Buy. I know it's early days, but interested to know your thoughts on potential impact and perhaps the trade-off between volumes and margins via that scheme.
Mark George Culmer
Andrew, yes, I'll do the first couple. Yes, as you said, on core, well, which I thought -- as you know we haven't given explicit guidance in terms of overall income for the full year. And it remains a sort of relatively challenging environment, et cetera, as you know. But certainly, as you say, in core NII, once we were -- so average interest-earning assets were down a percent, you've got the margin offsetting that. And you have seen, as you said, the pickup in core loans and advances. So we're feeling pretty good about the core NII trends. In terms of OOI, particularly when I look at that Q4, Q1, as I said we'll report about -- as I said in the presentation, as you strip out insurance claims, which had a sort of a light Q4 because there was some write-backs and things like that for some of the weather provisions that we took midyear last year, it was down about 3%. If I strip out that number as to what's going on there, insurance assumption changes benefited Q4 by about GBP 40 million. And then also if I look at SJP -- and not the gain here, Andrew, but just the terms of the run rate, SJP was up about GBP 20 million, GBP 25 million or so Q4 versus Q1. And so they've had an impact on that, the overall Q4, Q1. If I exclude those Commercial Banking, it was up about 5% Q1 on Q4, which is encouraging. And I think that now represents about the fourth quarter or so in a row that we've seen growth in the Commercial Banking NII, which obviously we talked a lot about a couple of weeks ago. And it's an encouraging sign. So that's sort of the trends. And that's what we're seeing. And what was the third question was on -- oh, it was on the Help to Buy.
Andrew P. Coombs - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
On Help to Buy, yes.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Yes, I will take that one, Andrew. Well,  what I think is that this scheme, like the SLS, is a very well-thought scheme, and I think it will have a very relevant impact. And I have to say more than I think -- more than what I saw in some research notes that I have read. Why do I believe this? Because number 1, it is a very, very wide scheme. So contrary to the other schemes targets the mortgage markets, this is target at all the first-time buyers and also movers in the markets, so potentially has a very, very big impact, number 1. Second, the biggest factor, in my opinion, that is restricting the housing market at the moment and first-time buyers is the deposit that people have to put upfront, given the tightening of credit criteria in banks, given uncertainty on capital and FPC. As a consequence of this, about 75% LTV mortgages, prices have increased in the market, in my opinion, beyond what they would normally do in certainty of capital circumstances. To give you an idea, in my opinion, the prices from 75% LTV mortgage if you take for example a 4-year mortgage, are around 150 basis points higher than what they are at -- so if you take a 95% LTV mortgage, the difference in price to a 75% one is around 150 basis points, while we believe that the costs of credit per year, plus administrative costs that the government may have, should be on the range of 40 to 50 basis points. And therefore, this guarantee will provide much bigger, potential volumes with reasonable margin, as is the case now in the mortgage market and can have, I repeat, a significant impact on first-time buyers and as a consequence on the construction sector. So we see this scheme as potentially very impactful, like the FLS, and Lloyds being the largest mortgage player will do its best as we did in FLS to make it work.
Andrew P. Coombs - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. I'm just playing devil's advocate, how much of your SVR book do you think could be subject to -- cannibalization is the wrong word, but perhaps remortgaging with the assistance of this scheme on to new fixed rate?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Well, I think that is a relative point, Andrew. But if you look at the SVRs, we being the largest lender, kept our SVR pricing in the middle to the low side of the pack, given that, for example, the second largest lender has a much higher SVR. And therefore, we think and we have assessed this in-depth, that our net position should be quite neutral in that regard.

Your next question comes from Jason Napier of Deutsche Bank.
Jason Napier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Three please, if I may. Quick ones, I promise. The first was just on noninterest income coming back on the first quarter figure in core, excluding St. James's Place. George, the deconsolidation of that, presumably that happened on sale date, so I just wanted to confirm you were saying that Q1 revenues were down 20 to 25 as a consequence of SJP, but presumably for 2/3 of the quarter, the revenues are still left in. So I'm just trying to get a sense as to what the base number is for Q1 to take into Q2. Secondly, likewise for the noncore losses, I appreciate that you've mentioned the trend should continue. Where we are now on noncore is showing an impairment rate that's pretty much in line with core, exceptionally good relative to our expectations. I just wanted to check there weren't any sort of large recoveries in the first quarter, and that is an underlying number? And then thirdly, to do with the disposal that was announced yesterday, I'm afraid I may be being dense here. But if you've got GBP 600 million of RWAs against the book of GBP 1.5 billion, but a loss of GBP 250 million on 72 of consideration, that implies a book value of at least GBP 300 million, I think, for that unit. And I'm just trying to -- I'm struggling to understand why you would have had GBP 300 million of book against GBP 1.5 billion of assets?
Mark George Culmer
Jason, it's George here. So I'll pick up the first one. In terms of SJP, no, what actually happened, because it was disposed of so close to the quarter end, we actually took a full quarter's earnings. So 3 months worth of earnings come through the P&L. And just so you know, just for numbers and stuff, for example, so within the income line, so this SJP is sort of run rate rather than gains or anything like that. We had -- we're talking about GBP 86 million of income. And that's, for example, compared to a number that was north of, I think, it was about 110 or something like that in Q4. But it was GBP 86 million of income with about GBP 44 million of operating expenses. So those numbers that we had in, for Q1. And just so you know, for the full year 2012, those equivalents were about GBP 330 million on 170 million returns of income and expenses.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Yes, on the noncore AQRs, in Page 9, you can see that the noncore AQR in quarter 1 was 200 basis points, roughly. And it is higher than the non -- than the core book. The core book is at 50s, and the noncore is at 200, so as I say this is what we think -- this trend of improvement is a result on the actions that we are taking in noncore books. So we could see this positive trend in the coming quarters.
Mark George Culmer
Jason, to your third question, in terms of sort of working back, trying to back solve to the loss of sale. You've got to remember, the Spanish operation, this is a business that's been losing money for, I think, the last 3 or 4 years. And it was a weak position, and obviously, a weak market. And the loss actually comes about in terms of -- there's just some additional restructuring-type charges that we will actually be putting into that business ahead of the disposal. So there's nothing wrong with your math in terms of back solve, except that what it misses out, there'll be a number of restructurings that actually take place ahead of disposal, which gets you to that 250. But those numbers have to be brought in mind in terms of the track record of this business. And I think what for us is a hugely beneficial move in key terms of containing our exposure to that economy and taking GBP 1.5 billion of noncore away.
Jason Napier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So it's not, if it's not intangible, so if it's a restructuring provision, the impact on core capital is the GBP 250 million loss, right?
Mark George Culmer
That's correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Rohith Chandra-Rajan of Barclays.
Rohith Chandra-Rajan - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I wonder if I could follow-up on impairments and then also ask a quick one on the fair value unwind? Just on the impairments, could I just check the answer actually to Jason's questions, the noncore charge about 200 basis point in the quarter. Is my understanding correct that you expect that to come down a bit as the year progresses? And then also on your 50 to 60 basis points guidance for next year, if we assume that noncore -- sorry, that core stays around 50, that would imply core coming down through somewhere south of 100 basis points. Again, just wanted to check that was in line with your expectations. And then secondly, just on the fair value unwind, GBP 1.3 billion unwind relating to asset disposals, I just wanted to check how much is left in the pot to offset future disposals? That's it.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
I will answer the first one. So our expectation in impairments is, as you can see, the trends in the core book are quite stable. So -- and this is what we think you can expect in our core book in the coming quarters. The noncore, as I say, we think you could see positive improvements in the AQRs. At the same time, the size of the book is shrinking. So the combination of both things is what is making us to think that we can achieve the targets in AQR in -- for next year.
Rohith Chandra-Rajan - Barclays Capital, Research Division
And sorry, can you just give some indication in terms of is that less than 100 basis points on the noncore? Is that a sensible sort of assumption for next year?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Rohit, this is Antonio. In terms of the noncore, we don't give guidance on that, because it is -- it may be quite lumpy. But I think the point here is, as you have seen last year, and there were several quarters where the AQR of the core book has been below 50 basis points in a difficult economic environment. So we are very comfortable with the 50 basis points guidance for the core that we have given, because when we sell 50 to 60, we said with the core on the lower end, so we now are very comfortable about the core being really on the lower end. And it has even been lower last year, while the economic environment is still not great. And given, as once said, that the noncore is shedding quite quickly, the impact on the total AQR should not exceed the 60 basis points. You can derive from that depending on your assumptions on volumes, what the AQR would be for the noncore.
Mark George Culmer
And on the fair value stuff, I mean I don't have the figure at hand, but I wanted to -- sort of on the asset side of things, it's not a huge number. I want to say like GBP 1 billion, GBP 2 billion of that [indiscernible], but it's not that -- we'll come back to you, but it's not a huge number.
Rohith Chandra-Rajan - Barclays Capital, Research Division
So in the tax today, it says 1.1 [ph] GBP 262 million asset disposal losses offset by, I think, just over GBP 1.3 billion fair value unwind. So all I was wanting to understand is as you dispose of more assets, your expectation is that you'll continue to have fair value unwind to offset any losses?
Mark George Culmer
Yes, I mean they were -- yes, I mean to the extent to which there is fair value, what we're doing actually is as we disposed them, we're actually accelerating the recognition of that credit. It's just, as you know, it's just the timing thing. And as I said, in terms of how much is left in the bank, as I said -- I want to say it's about GBP 1 billion, GBP 2 billion, but we'll check that number. But I think what matters in all of this is actually we continue to do it in a capital-accretive fashion. From the Q1 disposals, I think it has added something like about GBP 450 million to the capital base. So we'll get back to you on the precise -- all we're doing is dragging forward because there would have been original time pattern and timeframe in terms of that fair value and how it was spread and when we thought that the sort of pull to pars would occur. But as we actually fell forward of that, we have to accelerate the timing. But I'll come back to you on that, what the number actually is.

Your next question comes from the line of Chintan Joshi of Nomura.
Chintan Joshi - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Can I start with capital, please? If I look at your Basel III core tier 1 progression, 88.1, including IAS 19 and also including about -- if I include the gilt sales, SJP and the share issuance, it's about GBP 1.5 billion. What I'm thinking is how do we get to 9% by the end of the year? Obviously, there'll be a lot of moving parts of the year, but if you could help us with the big moves because if I look at underlying, then there was about maybe a 10 bps improvement quarter-on-quarter if I exclude these sales, so just trying to think about progression here?
Mark George Culmer
Okay. So I'm going to -- I'm not going to give you sort of item by item. It is worth calling out. Again, I don't need to think through these numbers, but in staying flat, we've basically offset a 60 basis point drag in that first quarter. And as you've seen from the slides and you know yourselves, that's a combination of that accretive noncore rundown and the profitability, the increased profitability of the core franchise and things like the sale of SJP, they've been all core parts. And as we move into the next 9 months or so, we will continue that accretive noncore rundown. What you're seeing in terms of underlying profitability in the business in Q1, you will see stretch out through the rest of the year. So in terms of the trends on impairments and trends on expenses, we spent a lot of time this morning talking about income, but what you will see is a continued strong underlying profit, which obviously drives the sort of best form of capital, and that will play a key part. But I'm sorry, I'm not going to sit down and give you sort of an itemized breakdown. What I think matches most is the guidance that we've given that we do expect that to be above 9% by the end of the year.
Chintan Joshi - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Fair enough. If I can just then continue on Scottish Widows. I mean even like Danish compromise will come to that when we come to that. But currently, it's a GBP 5.1 billion deduction. What optimization could we have on this GBP 5.1 billion? I noticed you've done about GBP 1.5 billion of sub-debt in Scottish Widows. I'm just wondering, even without the Danish compromise, what is the potential to reduce this GBP 5.1 billion number?
Mark George Culmer
Okay, well, I mean it's a good point. It's worth emphasizing to people. But when we say above 9%, that is assuming Article 45. So thanks for that question actually. So that's -- so it's a sort of pretty conservative, and as I said, sort of worst case. And when we say above 9%, that is on an Article 45 basis. But in terms of optimization, yes, it's around -- well, first off you've got fundamental underlying profitability of the business and Scottish Widows is a good business, has been profitable, will continue to be profitable. That's the start of everything, if you like. Then there's looking around to be as capital efficient as you can be, and we're spending a lot of time working with the insurance team in terms of looking at that capital requirements in terms of looking at that capital position. I'm looking at things that we can do with actually -- with effectively hedge out some of the tail risks, for example, in some of their requirements would enable us to actually upstream the capital into the bank and therefore count on an Article 45 basis. So we were successful last year. Last year, I think we took out something like -- it was 2012, GBP 700 million from the insurance business in terms of capital upstreaming. I would expect to exceed that number. I'm not going to give you a precise amount, but I would expect to materially exceed that number in 2013. But it's around generating profit, so then it's about working with the business to see how we can actually reduce that capital requirement.
Chintan Joshi - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Okay. And finally, if I can just follow-up on the Help to Buy comments, Antonio, you had made. I mean if I'm thinking about that you're already active in the first time in our market currently, and that tends to be a good margin business. The Help to Buy will have some margin compression, so are you saying that the volume effect will offset the margin pressure that you may have in that area?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
That is absolutely my impression, because I strongly feel that there is a sort of market failure on the high LTVs given the capital uncertainty as I mentioned to you. And therefore, the tradeoff between margins that those high LTVs and -- will demand, which is being withhold from the market, in my opinion, should be positive. And I also think that it is very likely that the beginning of the scheme, which is effectively, as you know, January 1, will be the beginning in terms of completions, which means that we'll be able to start marketing for applications by the end of quarter 3, which should be positive as well.

Your next question comes from Tom Rayner of Exane BNP Paribas.
Thomas Rayner - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division
Can I have a couple of questions, please, on the core business trends and then maybe 1 on the dividend outlook. Just back on sort of core noninterest income, excluding the gains on St. James's, the year-on-year trend is sort of down, almost 6, looks perhaps a little bit weak. But if I strip out the revenue numbers, I think George gave in response to an earlier question, the GBP 86 million and the GBP 330 million. It looks as if the underlying trend is more like plus 7% year-on-year. Is that -- does that feel right to you, that sort of growth? And I'm interested -- and as the core loan book starts growing again, is that a driver of this line? Could you explain if I'm on the right line on that one, please? And I have another 2 questions.
Mark George Culmer
Indiscernible] it sounds a bit rich to me. I mean when I look Q1-on-Q1 last year, that stings like -- we're a slightly different business in terms of balance sheet size. And there are things like lower levels of bancassurance investment sales that have come through. So when I look at Q1-on-Q1, so I have to go back through your math, but stripping out and coming as a positive doesn't sound -- sounds a bit rich to me.
Thomas Rayner - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division
Okay. But I mean is it growing underlying, and is the growth in the loan book a driver of that line, do you think?
Mark George Culmer
It will be. Yes, it will be. It's going to take time to come through, but it will be. But again, thinking back to Q1 last year, there's some volatility again, thinking about last year, Q1 last year. I think Commercial Bank had a good OOI last year that was good -- trading market's activity actually in Q1 last year. But the loans and margins should drive the OOI activity as well. It may take -- it's going to take time to come through.
Thomas Rayner - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division
Okay. Also just secondly on the impairment, I think at the full year, you talked about the sort of trends in the core, sort of credit quality having stabilized, and sort of 50 basis points was the level it was at, which is where it is again roughly in Q1. I think Juan Colombás sort of then mentioned a range of 40 to 50. So just trying to get a sense, is 40 to 50 still within that sort of stable guidance, because obviously 50 to 40 is a reasonably [indiscernible].
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
I think so, it's 40 to 50 range on the core book.
Thomas Rayner - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division
Okay, perfect. And then just finally, on dividend, Antonio. And I read in the Sunday Telegraph anyway, so correct me if any of this is incorrect. But you mentioned that no alternative uses for the capital, therefore, at Lloyds will be a high dividend paying company. Once again, I know there's all sorts of things to get through with the FPC and everything. I'm trying to get a sense about when you are the right capital ratio, whatever that is. Will the payout ratio then be the only variable that moves, or is there some sort of natural cap on how high the payout ratio may go? Can you give me any color on that?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Yes, yes, I think, Tom, that you read correctly. I mean what -- the way I see it is the following: so as we complete the FPC exercise in '13; '14 will be very likely a very normal year. And as we have inflected the growth on the core loan book, and we will be rising given that the market is shrinking as a whole, we may increase our loans by imagine, 2%, 3%. That does not require a lot of capital. And given that we are generating 50 to 60 basis points of core tier 1 ratio per quarter now, given that our legacy issues are decreasing significantly, as you saw, obviously, Lloyds will come back to a high dividend paying stock in the future. And I think you are right when you mention that the payout is more or less, the only variable, because we are not -- we are completely committed, as you know, to getting this bank back on its feet profitable, lending to the economy and getting taxpayers' money back. So we're absolutely focused on that. Being a U.K. focused, Retail lender SME Bank, with 2 competitive advantages. The lowest cost structure of the sector, which will be critical for us to growingly offer better value for money for our customers, which I think is the only strategy compatible with the present regulatory environment. And second, we want to have the lowest cost of equity in the sector, because given we are on a AAA rated country, we have SME and Retail businesses, which are low volatility. We'll have the lowest cost structure. We have much less wholesale funding, much more capital, much less noncore assets. Every of these factors should contribute to a lower EBITA, and therefore, a lower cost of equity. And therefore, all the capital we are going to generate through lower costs and lower impairments will equates to capital and will be available in the future for dividends. And our purpose is to go back to high dividend paying stock.
Thomas Rayner - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division
Okay. And I guess the other variable, which has been a feature just in recent years has been PPI and other sort of redress. I mean is that an issue now that we can finally put behind us, do you think?
Mark George Culmer
Thomas, it's George again. Well, I mean you've seen the trends we got out this morning. And in terms of complaints, the non-PPI, they're trending where we expected them to be. Cash out the door is slightly higher than we expected, and that's part due to some, as I said in the presentation, some -- we've got to settle some cases, which is where -- or we'll be settling some cases within FOS and some VAT one-offs, et cetera. But certainly, the complaints trend is moving as we expected. I'm not seeing any encouraging signs. So that's what I would say on PPI. Obviously, we haven't changed any of the other legacy provisions in terms of interest rates, stocks, et cetera. So that's still out there. I'm never going to say never, but it's just a question of working your way through these.

Your next question comes from Raul Sinha of JPMorgan.
Raul Sinha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I have 1 point of clarification and then a couple of questions, please. Just on the point of clarification, I was wondering if -- there was a currency impact in core loans as well. You very kindly stripped it out of noncore. And I was just wanting to make sure that the core loan growth is not distorted by any currency moves?
Mark George Culmer
Raul, it's George here. There is a very small currency impact on the WAFI bit. So I think on one of the slides, we break out where the core loans advances comes from. And I think WAFI's up about -- I forgot the precise number. But there's a small element of FX, but it is a small, it is a tiny amount.
Raul Sinha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Right, excellent. Just in terms of my other 2 questions then. Firstly, I was wondering if you might be able to comment a bit on any pipeline of disposals outside of noncore in Verde. Obviously, are there any areas that you might be willing to flag to us that could deliver another nice game like SJP did, just thinking about the FEC? And then my second question is on the impact of Retail, picking up loan growth in the second half of the year. What do you think the impact of that might be on the asset margin and the mix? Obviously, it was 4 basis points negative in the core in this quarter. Do you anticipate that gets worse as we go through the rest of the year? And what sort of magnitude do you think that might be currently?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
So on your first question, and George will take the second one. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is relating to that question is like in football. Prognosis, only after the game finishes, i.e., we like to do things and then communicate them. And I'm sure you understand about that, so we cannot comment any further. George, can you comment on...
Mark George Culmer
Sorry, second question was again? Sorry.
Raul Sinha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
It's on the impact of Retail's loan growth pipeline. Obviously, you're flagging that it's going to pick up. And I was wondering what you think it might have an impact on the asset margin?
Mark George Culmer
Oh, okay. Well, we have said since June last year that our plan was if you remember as we would be getting to 100% core loan-to-deposit ratio, we said then by March, which we did that during the first half, like SMEs in the past 2 years, mid-corps and large corporate, which start to grow, which has now happened a quarter earlier than we thought. And we said that the whole core book would grow in the third quarter because in the second one, we would reach a market share in mortgages of around 25%. And from then onwards, we would start growing with the market, which is now growing less than 1%. So fortunately, the growth in quarter 1, which as I said, I now expect to continue, has more than offset the mortgage decrease. That's why the total core loan book increased by -- increased as a whole in quarter 1, so 6 months ahead of the previous plan. And the actions that we have been taking already, because don't forget that applications take place, at least 4 months before actual completions. All the actions we have been taking in terms of management are absolutely in line for our mortgage book to start growing with the market in quarter 3, so I do not expect to see -- I don't expect you to see any change in terms of present competitive behavior because those are actions we are already taking -- implementing in the market ahead of completions as we do the applications.
Raul Sinha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Right. The reason I asked the question, Antonio, is obviously, we can see declines in the asset margin in the credit conditions.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Yes, that's right. That's right. And relating to that point, as you know, we may be different with some other banks. We always manage this Retail margin as the asset margin minus the deposit margin. What we really manage is the difference between the 2, especially now that we have 100% core loan-to-deposit ratio. And as you see from our Slide #7, that you are right about the asset margin. It has been going down given FLS. For the same reason, deposit margins has been going up because of FLS. And again, over the last quarter, we were able to manage the difference between the 2 in a positive way that the increase in deposit margin more than offset the decrease in the asset margin, which we continue to manage very tightly on a weekly basis, by the way, at the highest level of the organization. And we expect that picture to continue going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from Manus Costello of Autonomous.
Manus Costello - Autonomous Research LLP
Since we're on Slide 7, actually, I wanted to stay there for my question please. I wondered if you could give us an indication in the first quarter of what level of your mortgage book is currently on SVR? And how that has changed in Q1 versus where we were at the end of Q4? Obviously, following up on Raul's question about the potential for asset mix and margin changes going forward? And secondly, just on a point of detail, can you give us an indication of how the gilt sales will impact in Q2 on Q1, what the headwind will be from that? And then I assume by Q3, we're done and the run rate of margin is not going to have any more impact from the gilt sales?
Mark George Culmer
So the -- I don't have at hand in terms of where the SVR has moved. I mean it's at, what is it, 60% or so of portfolio? I haven't seen -- to look to see where it's moved Q4 versus Q1, but I certainly wouldn't expect to see any material shift change in that percentage, actually, Manus. We'll go back and check. In terms of the gilts again, in terms of Q2, actually, it will be a bit about a similar-type performance in terms of how the 8 basis points busts down. We'll go back and check, but I imagine Q2 will be a similar amount. And then as you said, I'd start catching up on myself. So sorry if I was a little bit vague, but I think as I said, we'll come back in terms of...
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
If your question was related to the guidance, we had given at year end, the 198. When we gave it, we had already in our plan that we would sell these additional gilts, okay? If that was the question.
Manus Costello - Autonomous Research LLP
Yes, that was part of the question. And just back on the first question, so just a more strategic point about any potential SVR switch. I think from a comment to an earlier question, Antonio, you were suggesting that you didn't think that the drop in rates across the mortgage market was going to have any impact on SVR and that you think that sort of 60% level will stay stable?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Well, what I said is that I think, as per question, that it will have impact in the market as a whole. But I think on our specific position, given the positioning of our prices in SVR, it should be neutral for us. That's what I said.
Operator
And your last question comes from Arturo de Frias of Santander.
Arturo de Frias Marques - Grupo Santander, Research Division
I would like to ask you about ROE trends or ROTE trends, particularly on core. I was running one quick number. If we exclude the gains of the sale of St. James's Place and annualize what's going on in core, we get to an ROTE of around 18% for this year. And if I add to that all your comments during this call or the guidance during this call, i.e. NIM still improving, volumes probably growing, partially thanks to the Help to Buy program, additional Simplification costs coming through and impairments stable in the region of 40 to 50 bps, it looks increasingly clear to me that the ROTE core is going to exceed that 20% very soon, probably already in 2014? I know that's my view and not your view. But can I ask you if all those comments are, more or less, reasonable descriptions of reality, in your view?
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
Arturo, that is a very important question, so I'll ask our Finance Director to answer it..
Mark George Culmer
Look, I'm not going to comment on the specifics, but you're dead right in terms of -- and there's a message we've been pushing out in terms of the earnings power and the returns that we make within the core business. They've been consistent over the sort of last 12 months or so. And you're right, with improving trends in terms of impairments, expenses, what we're seeing on the NIM, we remain very confident about the financial performance of the book. And you're right, if I strip out -- I think we talked about return on risk-weighted assets, over 3%, but it's still up about 2 53, I think, in the quarter if I strip out SJP. So this is a book that makes strong returns. I'm not going to comment on your 18% or 20%. And you know what our overall targets are, but that's part of the reason why we feel confident that we will actually meet those targets.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
And Arturo, I might add because I think your point is quite strategic, quite relevant that we should not underestimate the power of a leading brand. I mean this is the leading bank in this country in Retail and SMEs, Lloyds is the leading high street brand. Halifax is the leading challenger brands, the power of a multi-brand strategy with top brands in a very, very -- in a large market, such as the U.K., which has very interesting structure in terms of number of players and very interesting dynamics in terms of front book, back book has huge potential, and you have leading brands and the right strategy. I am very optimistic about the potential going forward of the core book of Lloyds, which as you said, is emerging as we share the noncore. And I repeat the power of leading brands is unparalleled to second tier brands.
Arturo de Frias Marques - Grupo Santander, Research Division
Okay, can I ask also something very quickly on the dividend. Assuming that the PRA lifts the uncertainty on capital soon, whenever that happens, could we expect you to give the market some guidance on payout ratios after that?
Mark George Culmer
In time, in time.
António Mota de Sousa Horta-Osório
It's very likely, Arturo, yes. Because I think that fact is that the FPC is now focusing on having the situation completely clear in terms of stress tests for the end of '13. I think by the same token, at least '14 is a total normal year, and therefore, with full clarity for '14. Sorry, what you're saying is very logical.
