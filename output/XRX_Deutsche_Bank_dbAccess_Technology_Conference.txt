Question-and-Answer Session
Unidentified Analyst
Well thanks a lot for that. Tom, maybe a good place to start would just to provide an overview of your responsibilities to business units that are fall under your daily working and perhaps a high level update on the BPO business and the ITO business.
Tom Blodgett
Okay, thank you. And thanks for joining with us today. For those of you that may not be aware, Xerox is a $22 billion company divided primarily into two segments. Xerox Technologies which is kind of a legacy printing, copier, printing services business and Xerox Services, which is primarily the ACS acquisition that happened a little over three years ago. My responsibility as COO of the Commercial Business which represents about $5 billion of revenue, it includes our ITO outsourcing business, our HR outsourcing business, our financing and accounting outsourcing business, our customer care business as well as our CMS or communication marketing services business. And also responsible, just move back recently from London to the US, so I also have responsibility for our services business in Europe.
And overall, our business is on track. Surprisingly we are doing well in Europe as well and our sales engine is working, our bookings are up and we're relatively positive about what the future looks like.
Unidentified Analyst
I don't know if you remember but two years ago, you and I said, I think might have been this exact same stage two years ago. At the time, you were coming right off the deal. Can you give us a little perspective, just looking back over the past couple of years and tell us what's worked, what hasn’t worked at the time of a big part of the story was around synergy and accelerating, the demand creation side, leveraging the Xerox brand particularly in global markets. Give us a report card on the deal. How has it helped you and what could you do better?
Tom Blodgett
Okay, good. That was 3.5 years ago. I actually got invited to a meeting; it was a confidential private meeting. Ursula Burns, who was the CEO, who is the CEO and Chairman at Xerox and their CFO, was there, my younger brother, Lynn who is also my boss was there and in this meeting, the message was portrayed from Xerox thus that they had some interest in acquiring us. I remember at the time, I didn’t know very much about Xerox and I said to my brother, what's going on? These guys make photocopying machines, what sense would there be in them acquiring a BPO company. But as I learned more about Xerox and their strengths and how that lined up against some of our weakness at ACS, it made perfect sense.
So let me tell you what those strengths and weaknesses were and then I can answer your question about what's worked and what are we still working on. So first of all, we were intrigued by the brand of Xerox. Almost everybody in all places of the world have heard of Xerox. They know the brand and nobody's heard of ACS, not even our customers. And so, that was a positive thing.
So that was a positive brand and that has proven to be a value as we go around the world, as we go to the US, you bring up the name Xerox, you don't have to go through an explanation of what it means. Many times when I say I was from ACS, people would say was that American Cancer Society, then I would have to explain, no that's not what it is.
So, secondly, global. So, ACS at the time for those that are not aware, we were primarily US based customer company, even though we were $7 billion and we had $70,000 employees, many of them throughout the world, our customers were primarily based in the United States. And when we saw Xerox and found out that over 50% of their revenue came from customers outside the US, we got excited about the ability to leverage the Xerox global footprint to help our business grow. We'd also dreamed about being big in Europe and being in Latin America. But this is actually an opportunity to take and manage Xerox's footprint. And that particular aspect has proven to be successful in certain areas and not so much in other areas.
And then thirdly, research and development, ACS, I think our budget was like $2 a year on research and development, and Xerox mans between $500 million and $700 million a year in R&D. and so we thought okay, here is an opportunity for us to leverage and take advantage of that culture that exists at Xerox which is innovation, research and development and they have some centers and world class centers throughout the world, one of them is in Park in Palo Alto, one of them is in Webster, New York, one in Grenoble, France and these are centers that are dedicated with very smart people on inventing technology to solve problems. And so we'd use that extensively, we've taken many, many customers into those centers. We've had gleaming sessions, which is basically a session where you sit down with a customer, you talk about what their problems are, what their business process problems are and how technology could potential help solve that and then you’ve got these smart people from Xerox who then try to develop and help come up with a technology that will help and so that's been positive.
So in terms of those weakness that we had at ACS and the strength that Xerox's had, it has been all that we had hoped for. Now, where do we still need, where are we working and where do we need to continue to work. Clearly our global footprint, where we're relatively happy with what has happened in parts of Europe and where we've seen some great progress. We still have work to do in Latin America and in Asia Pac. So our dream of becoming a more global company is one that we've taken some steps but we still have work to go
I think the other area that we'd like to see a little more focus on two more areas, one is, our rate of acquisitions. I think we had a really good track record ACS of acquisitions. We've got a few acquisitions since we became part of the Xerox world but that's something that needs to accelerate. We use acquisitions to help fill voids that we have in our product offering or geographic footprint problem. And I think we need to see an acceleration of acquisitions to help us in those areas.
Unidentified Analyst
If I could play devil's advocate on a couple of items for a moment, I can't resist myself but if I look at the underlying organic growth rate of the company at ACS, prior to the deal and after the deal, it doesn’t look like there's been much change or much inflection point and granted there is a cycle here but has been part of the Xerox brand allows you to grow faster? I guess, that's number one. And then number two on the geographic footprint side, can you give us a sense of flavor as to what the revenue exposure by major geo has changed in the past three and half years just to give us a sense as to how successful you are, where in moving now, kind of the way, center of the way the revenue model.
Tom Blodgett
Sure, when you take a look at growth, there is really several levers that go into determining our growth. And that includes renewal rates, it includes what kind of discounts are offered when we do renewals. In some cases it has do with macroeconomics that are going on in a particular area and so when you take a look at what we've accomplished, we're satisfied at least partially, always wanted to growing more but when we take a look at the challenges that we faced in certain geographies as well as business mix change, the fact that certain governed regulations may cause businesses that we have to be rolled , the fact that we are renewing businesses and offering in some cases discounts that have an erosion factor. The fact that we are able to achieve our objectives of mid to about mid-single digit growth, is actually something that we're satisfied with, and obviously we want it to be more, we want to grow more but when you consider what it could have been, I think we would be consensus that the Xerox merger has helped us in terms of maintaining our growth.
In terms of geographic footprint. Clearly as I mentioned, I spent the last two years in London with a very specific focus of leveraging Xerox and growing the business and we've had some good success there. We've build an organization, we've seen revenues increase substantially, we've done three acquisitions that are turning out to be very good for us, very successful on track in terms of their model and so I think that if you look at Europe, we've seen some significant growth.
Clearly in Latin America and clearly in Asia Pac, we have work to do and we have not seen what we expect or what we need out of those areas. I think as you look forward, you'll continue to see investments in Europe and in the other global markets.
Unidentified Analyst
I wanted to ask a growth question a different way. I think in the past you used to talk about 6% to 8% topline growth as a medium to longer term target. What did it take to get back on track to those types of growth numbers. And what's the shape of the curve and the key drivers that get us from here to there?
Tom Blodgett
So we have a target to grow mid-single digits to upper single-digits so your 5% to 8% is good. And that's broken up into several components. One that as I mentioned in our renewal rate and actually we were quite pleased, especially in the last quarter, where we had a 95% renewal rate. We also have organic growth. So growth that comes from selling -- with our sales people selling to customers, whether they are existing customers or new customers and actually our bookings have been solid .
One area where we need to accelerate and it represents between 1% and 3% of our growth, really centers around acquisitions and at least over the last couple of quarters, at least in 2013, we've seen a little bit of a softness there, it’s a little bit lumpy, we have a pipeline and its really more we're waiting for the right opportunity rather than anything else.
So, what does it take to get us back on track? I think if we could see an acceleration and closing some of the deals in the pipeline in terms of acquisition, that could make up a couple of percent to help get us to where we needed to do -- to be.
Secondly, we want need to make sure that we're executing affectively and on time on the new business that we signed, because any delay in that implementation can also delay the resulting revenue.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it and if we look at the first half bookings, year-on-year bookings numbers are quite strong year-on-year. I know there is a lot of renewal activity within the booking. But can you help parse for us kind of the trends you're seeing on organic new bookings versus renewals and based on book business, how does that fold into in organic revenue look for the next six to 12 months?
Tom Blodgett
The bookings in the services business have been strong all year where we have seen, growth over previous years and when you combine that with the high renewal rate, we get back to this point that we have to have this successful implementation of that business. And there are certain areas of our business that are growing that bookings are strong -- stronger than the average than some of our government healthcare business have seen good activity and some of our customer care activity we are seeing some significant lends. There are some business in Europe, with the government with the private technology sector over there that had been strong. And some of our other businesses may be are falling a little bit below but overall we are bullish on the bookings and I think we just need to continue with successful bookings and operational excellence in terms of delivery and I think with the acquisitions that are there, that should get us back up to our target growth rates.
Unidentified Analyst
And then the follow on question would clearly be on margins. I think the margin line in the ACS and both the BPO business and the ITO business are pretty key drivers for the equity holders and be put the stock price going forward. So, can you give us a sense as to how you balance renewals? You did take price concession. How large are those price concession? How do you manage those price concessions when you do renew.
And then secondly, new business does tend to come on at lower margin. So how do you, you showed these huge bookings numbers, but I think the fear that perhaps those bookings will come on at lower margins as you renew and as you just ramp mid contracts that inherently have lower margins at the start of the contracts. So how do you manage that dynamic?
Tom Blodgett
One of the things you need to understand about Xerox Services, we are actually a combination of about 80 different businesses, all the way from processing, health claim forms for a state to collecting tolls in New York to answering phone calls for large wireless companies and each one of those 80 businesses has a different profile both in terms of the investments required to bring up a project and also what the end result margin's going to be. So one of the big drivers that we're focused on right now are to improve and maintain and improve margin, has to do with what we call portfolio management or the ability to look at our businesses and make sure that those businesses are the most successful that have the highest growth and the highest margin are also the businesses that get the most investment. By investment I mean new hiring, hiring of new sales resource, acquisitions, as we target acquisitions, we're looking at acquisitions that will be in that space where they are higher margin and also the ones that are growing.
I think that in terms of margin, we are very focused on margin percentage. It's one of our key metrics that we look at and the way that we are going to continue to maintain that and improve it has to do with portfolio management that I mentioned, we're also very aggressive in changing the way we do business. By that I mean we are using both technology and innovation to say is there a way to perform this business process automatically rather than using labor. So that's a way for us to cut costs, often times improve quality and as a result, our margins are improved.
In addition, we are a company committed to a global production. We have 30% to 40% of our employees are offshore or in lower labor costs markets. And clearly that's an area we need -- we are focused on increasing that number and as we do that, they are in our margins improve.
And then thirdly, we need to make sure that when we win new deals that we are focused on proper execution, that as we bring them live, we do it on time and on budget, so that there aren't any unexpected headwinds.
So proper execution of new deals, changing the way we do business with innovation and our global labor capability and then finally portfolio management. Make sure that the businesses with the higher margins are the ones that are growing.
Unidentified Analyst
My question is, when you look at the acquisitions, clearly you're trying to drive growth. Where do you look at the acquisitions, how big, how small and what are you trying to -- is it more of a margins, more of a growth, what are you trying to acquire and why would they sell because it's Xerox, that's quite another question.
Tom Blodgett
So when we do an acquisition, we have a pretty good process. I think when Xerox bought ACS, they recognized that one of our core competencies was the ability to do acquisitions and have them be successful. We've done about 100 acquisitions since we were found at 1988 and high percentage, in the 90% of those were successful. And so they took that, Xerox took that and said, okay, we want you to be the drivers of acquisition in the whole Xerox community. When we do an acquisition, we do it for a couple of reasons, it isn't for revenue growth, although that's a byproduct of it. We do an acquisition for one or two reasons. Either, it needs to fill a product offering, a service offering void that we have. We are losing deals because we can't do XYZ or the competition is better than us in XYZ. So often times we'll then go and do an acquisition that will help round out our portfolio offering so that we can be more successful.
The second reason is, if we have a geographic footprint hold that says, hey, we really need to have something in this territory and rather than the time and investment to do it organically we do an acquisition and that helps fill out the geographic offering.
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible]
Tom Blodgett
Well there is really a couple, let me answer that question. There is a couple top sizes of acquisitions that we do. Sometimes, we'll do a small acquisition because they have some technology that we really like or really want. But most likely the sweet for an acquisition is somewhere at least $25 million of annual revenue up to a couple of $100 million in annual revenue. That's the sweet spot. But we're also opportunity driven. We recently acquired a little company in London. We only have $3 or $4 million of revenue, but they had some software technology that we were very interested in. So there are exceptions to the rule but in order to justify the efforts that we go through into make some difference, generally they have to be little bit bigger than that.
One of the areas that we're focused on and one of the areas that will also help us in terms of improving our margin is to take advantage of the fact that we have lots and lots of data. We process millions of health claims a day. We answer several million phone calls a day. We record all of those phone calls and we have the ability to convert those audio files to text and as a result, we have massive amounts of data and one of the value adds that we are looking at and we have done some acquisitions has to do with analytics and how do we take that data that we have almost unlimited amounts of data and analyze it and become a source of management information decision making for our customers.
We did a little acquisition in the UK, in Poole, England, a company called WDS and their business is really talking to a wireless providers and consulting with them on how they can be more effective in product launches and also in reduction -- in reducing call volume.so rather than going in and saying hey, we want to win a contract for 500 seats of a call center, we go in and say, you are taking 10 million calls a month and we have some tools that will cut that down to 8 million. And so it’s a value add.
So analytics is another area where we would consider a hot area for us in terms of acquisition.
Unidentified Analyst
[indiscernible] quickly I want to ask a quick one along these lines. Are you getting the capital from Ursula to execute your strategy?
Tom Blodgett
Definitely we are. At the start of the year, there were target numbers that were set up to say, here's a bucket of money for acquisitions and it was sufficient for what we wanted to accomplish. We have not been able to execute and deliver and find the right kind of company so there are still fogs left in that bucket. So the issue is not funding. We have -- I am confident we have the funding that we need regardless of the size of the deal.
Unidentified Analyst
Chris, you indicated at the beginning of the year about 400 million to 500 million [indiscernible] locations.
Unidentified Analyst
Regarding the healthcare practice, which is running more profitable and definitely weren't practices, over the weekend it was a series of articles, IBN, Time Warner Cable about their health care exchanges and what they are doing. Can you talk about your capabilities in that specific arena and then how you compete with what appears to be the largest player in the space, (inaudible) the differences that you bring to that opportunity. Thank you.
Tom Blodgett
Sure, I think that if you take a look at our healthcare business, we recently as of July 1st, organized a healthcare segment. So we took our private healthcare business, so we do a lot of work for insurance companies for the payers, we do a lot of work for hospitals and our provider business and then we are a major player, if not a major player in state health care administration. We put those together in one organization and so we're in a pretty unique position to take advantage of whatever the shift might be as we talk about healthcare and the migration and evolution that's taking place between private healthcare and government healthcare and also the expanding demographic of people that need healthcare. So, I would say that when you talk about state healthcare and most states where we're responsible for processing their Medicaid, Medicare kinds of forms, we're in a solid position to compete with anybody.
Unidentified Analyst
On that specifically though, around healthcare exchanges, are you actively bidding that type of work you have win there?
Tom Blodgett
Yes, we are bidding healthcare exchanges and again, we have great relationships with several states and have leveraged also relationships to help them as they have their requirements to meet the mandated standards related to healthcare exchanges and we are active with multiple states on establishing those exchanges.
Unidentified Analyst
So [indiscernible] come out from a corporate standpoint given their historical relationship with those corporates you're going to come out more from a state perspective.
Tom Blodgett
Yes, those were our relationships and we've been involved with them for a number of years in many states in terms of processing their needs in terms of healthcare processing.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, I would just like to pick up on the healthcare exchange question. So, what is specifically is the business opportunity? Is it -- do you get paid to build it and then you step away or is there a tail on the exchange for an IT service provider?
Tom Blodgett
So clearly there is a tail on the exchange. Our business process outsourcing and helping with both front office and back office functions. So as a healthcare exchange is created and there is a need for example enrollment activities or payment activities or eligibility activities, that's our sweet spot and so we feel like the healthcare exchange development design is really just the first step and the services that we can provide to those states.
Unidentified Analyst
So specifically, is that a payment per transaction or is that the contract volumes and then a breakpoints?
Tom Blodgett
Each different state would have a different approach to how this contract is structured and funded and it could be per member per month or it could be a transactional.
Unidentified Analyst
So is Massachusetts, I am from the West Coast, so I don't [indiscernible], is Massachusetts have a healthcare exchange or is there one that's sort of operational that we could all study and understand that you're involved with?
Tom Blodgett
To be honest with you, healthcare isn't part of my work, so I don't know. I know that we've won several states and now we'll just come live in California, but I don't know specifically what we're doing in Massachusetts.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you just talk a little bit about the SYNNEX acquisition that IBM or maybe IBM's BPO customer care business, how you guys think of that, changes in competitive dynamic at all and if there was something you were looking at given I know you refer to that a lot as the growing piece of your BPO business.
Tom Blodgett
Yes, good question and well timed. I think that as I read through the press release, we did take a brief look at it some months ago and decided that it didn’t fit our model. I think we take a different approach to customer care than what was presented and the logic behind that divestiture that it was a commodity business that was low margin in our growth. We look at it completely different. We think that the customer care is a critical part of the customer experience and that with the implementation of the proper innovation and technology that there is a value add that can be provided there that can be of great benefit to customers. So I think we see that customer care call center world as we look at it on more end to end basis rather than just what's happening while the person's on the phone, that's a great opportunity for us, we're developing technology that helps us be not only more efficient but through analytics and some of the other things that we're doing with social media, help the customers improve their customers experience and I think you'll see us continue to grow in that area. And the margins that we enjoy in that area will be within the ranges that we're looking for our business.
Unidentified Analyst
You’ve done a nice job sort of maintaining margin actually improving margin percent in the deal and technology business. I am curious where you're cutting the cost to do that and is there any limit on -- do you see any headwinds in the future of maintain margin that part of business?
Tom Blodgett
Well I think -- we have a target, we've told the folks our goals, 10% to 12% margin in our services business, we're kind of at the low end of that right now. And we have some major initiatives underway to continue to over time maintain and improve our operating profit margin. And as I mentioned, your question was, is there a limit. Clearly, the limit is somewhat driven by the market but we can impact that by the use of innovation as we do things automatically with technology rather than with people, if we're ahead of the market in that, then that allows us to have above market margin.
Our ability to continue to use the right labor in the right cost is also a way that we're able to improve margin. If we can do something and do it in a near shore location or a faraway location and do it more effectively than our competition then that's a margin improvement as well. And we think that there are opportunities both analytics and our labor force and in overall operational excellence that allows us to take the margins from where we are now and improve them to get more to the middle of the high range. Some of those things take a little bit of time but clearly we have a glide path that says you'll continue to see margins improve.
Unidentified Analyst
You're hitting on a couple of big themes that we've been hearing at this technology conference for the day and a half or so and one is automation and the other is big data and advanced analytics against the data. So can you perhaps give us a sense that and help us understand what you're capabilities actually are in these areas? How much of your R&D budget or how much R&D is being spent in developing these technologies. And what -- why can't you take on the big guys like IBM who are developing similar types of tools? How do you differentiate against existing large software vendors who are all building tools targeting these same kinds of opportunities.
Tom Blodgett
Well I think don't underestimate our size and our scope. I think when you take a look at the particular area of the market that we play in, we're formidable competitor. We hope that they underestimate us. But I think the way that we differentiate, the reason why we win, the reason why we're booking the bookings, is because we provide operational excellence. We deliver quality, we deliver it on time and we deliver on a price that is competitive. We accomplish that through innovation and sometimes that innovation is invented by Xerox and often times it's acquired. An example we bought this company WDS headquartered in the UK and their business is data analytics and they provide data analytics to the wireless community and they have a data base that they've built over the years called Global Mine that has unlimited amounts of data about wireless, about handsets, about the wireless phones and what the challenges are. That information is coming from the manufacturers, it's coming from our call centers, it's coming from lots of sources. They've also developed the analytics engine that's called ASK that will support questions that people have about handsets. The unique thing about the capability that we have at WDS is that oftentimes questions can be answered without human intervention, so whether it’s a query coming from an email or it’s a social media query, or it’s a phone call, that database and those tools, because of their sophistication can actually analyze the question, go in and look through the massive amounts of data and come back with a question that solves the problem without a human being involved.
So that kind of analytics in those tools help us provide, be competitive and provide solutions at a better price.
Unidentified Analyst
I wanted to ask a bigger picture question, just to that wrap here in terms of the structure of the organization across synergies, cross selling opportunity between vacuum and outsourcing BPO and ITO and specifically because ITO and BPO kind of have beaten those of those buckets. What are the synergies between those two businesses if at all and how core is ITO to the barometer ACS strategy or BO strategy?
Tom Blodgett
Clearly, we think it’s a great advantage having our ITO business. We actually started this company in the ITO business. But as you look at any BPO offering, any BPO deal that we're after, there is always an IT component, whether its network or desktop or whatever, the fact that we can bring in our experts from our ITO division, it helps. We become experts, whether its disaster backup or whatever. We also see a lot of synergy between some of the managed print and ITO. Oftentimes we're talking to the same buyer within the organization and there is a lot of -- very closely connected synergies between the printing managed print global document kind of activities and ITO. So again, we run and ITO business, we're successful, but it's also a critical part of our ability to win BPO contracts and a differentiator against some of our competitors.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, with that, the clock's ticking away from us. So we're going to have to wrap. Thanks very much guys. I really appreciate it.
Tom Blodgett
