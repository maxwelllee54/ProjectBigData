Pin the Connected Living Room of Your Dreams and Win
Put on your interior designer hat, and pin the connected living room of your dreams!  For Mashable's first Pinterest contest, we want you to create a board filled with things you want in your ultimate living room.  
Create your "Connected Living Room" Pinterest board and "decorate" it with the coolest furnishings you can find online.  Search out the most luxurious sofa or the most high-tech fireplace, and get to pinning!  You could win one of three brand new gadgets, including the new 47" LG Google TV.  (Full list of prizes below)
In addition to winning one of these prizes, your board could also be featured in a follow-up story on Mashable.  We will also repin standout entry pins from Mashable's Pinterest account.  Be sure to read the official contest rules here.  
When building your board, be creative! Think of all the different elements that would make up your perfect living room (including decor, wall color and possibly even pets!).  Make sure your board is public, and not set to secret.  Click the image below, then complete the steps to enter.
The entry pins can be found on Mashable's Connected Living Room Pinterest Board.
