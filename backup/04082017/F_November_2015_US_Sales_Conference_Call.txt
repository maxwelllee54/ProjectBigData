Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company monthly sales call hosted by Erich Merkle. My name is Julie, and I am your event manager. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Erich. Please go ahead, sir.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Ford's November 2015 sales call. Today, we're joined by Mark LaNeve, Ford's Vice President, U.S. Marketing Sales and Service; and Yong Yang, Ford's Senior U.S. Economist.
Let's dive into some of the numbers now. Looking at this morning's early data, we believe last month's total industry sales, including medium and heavy trucks, hit approximately 1.33 million vehicles for the month of November. This would translate into a total SAAR roughly in the mid-18 million vehicle range. This is roughly consistent with last year with an industry mix of about 81% retail and 19% fleet. This is the industry's fifth straight month running above the 18 million vehicle SAAR level.
So if we take a look at some of the segment trends this month, we saw small SUVs just continue to move higher. They were up 2 points versus a year ago, representing more than 19% of the overall industry last month. This is again strong demand from Baby Boomer and Millennials, plus lower fuel prices that just continues to drive growth in the segment.
The small cars segment last month represented about 17.5% of the overall industry, which was about 1 point drop from year-ago levels and essentially unchanged relative to October. If we take a look at midsize cars, they continued declining. They represent now about 12% of the industry in November, and that's about a 1 point decline from a year ago.
Average transaction pricing continues to improve in the SUV segment overall, which gained about $500 in November relative to a year ago. If we look at full-size pickup trucks, full-size pickups represented about 13% of the overall industry in November, which was consistent with year ago and also in October.
The strong volume associated with full-size pickup trucks comes against a backdrop of stronger average transaction pricing, which was about $42,300 for the month of November, which represents a $2,500 increase compared to last year and a $500 increase relative to October.
So as we wrap up some of the high-level industry commentary now, I'd like to turn things over to Mark LaNeve to take a closer look at Ford and Lincoln news. Mark?
Mark LaNeve
Great. Thank you, Erich, and good morning to everyone. Our overall sales for Ford for the month of November totaled 187,794 vehicles, that was up slightly, actually 0.4% over a good November for us a year ago.
It's hard to believe itâ€™s December 1, we're getting to a time of the year where we're running out of months, and we're taking a look at our year-to-date sales, and we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date, were up 5% versus last year. That's over 113,000 units with one big month to go. Most of that increase is in retail and our retail sales have hit their best year since 2005, driven by consumer demand for our newest vehicles.
Our full product range saw great gains in transaction prices in November as well, thanks to lower incentives and a really strong mix of higher series vehicles. In fact, Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Mustang, Escape, Edge, Explore, Expedition and F-Series were all up in transaction pricing. It drove our transaction prices up $3,800 for Ford in November year-over-year, more than any other major automaker by a wide margin. We had just really exceptional price performance across our entire lineup.
Taking a look at trucks. We sold over 65,000 F-Series, that's a strong number for November. At that number, F-Series retail sales were up 16% and it was our best November ever for F-150, specifically. Those numbers boosted overall F-Series volume to a 10% increase for the month.
This comes against a backdrop of average transaction pricing that was $400 higher than October, so sequentially month-to-month up $400 and $2,700 higher than a year ago, with overall F-Series transaction pricing totaling $42,800 per truck. So we remain very pleased with the strength of our F-Series business, as we close out this year and head into 2016.
Our van sales continue to be incredibly encouraging for us. They grew in November with our overall van sales up 59% and 17,815 vans sold. Transit sales specifically sold 9,584 vehicles last month. That's almost double versus a year ago. And year-to-date Transit is over -- November got us over 100,000 for the year, actually were 105,000 through November, and Transit just continues to be an incredible story for us. It's opened up a whole new customer base in a very important commercial market, and we continue to see upside moving forward.
Connect sales, Transit Connect were also strong 4,237, representing the small vans best-ever November, 94% gain compared to last year. Our overall truck sales, when you total them up including F-Series and vans were up 18%, and represent our best November for truck sales performance since 2007.
On the SUV front, Ford brand SUVs performed incredibly well through November this year, with sales of about 675,000 vehicles through November of 2015. This is Ford brand's best November year-to-date SUV performance since 2003. So we continue to benefit with a strong new lineup and obviously strong consumer preference for SUVs and CUVs.
Sales of the new Ford Edge increased 6% to 8,137 vehicles sold with incredibly strong turn rates at just 22 days to turn. The new Explorer continued growing its sales with 15,141 vehicles sold, represent Explorer's best November sales results since 2004 and continues to be just a very hot product for us with dealers calling all the time looking for more production. Days to turn on Explorer were strong at 17 days, driven in a large part by the all new Platinum model, which saw retail sales nearly double versus October.
Now, for the Lincoln, we had a solid retail sales month, with retail sales consistent with year-ago levels, while the premium industry was down 12% versus last November. And the all new MKX provided an 18% increase in sales with very short inventories in just 26 days to turn.
So that's a snapshot of November. We're looking forward to a strong finish to the year. December has become one of the very best sales times of the year. We're going to be moving to a new holiday sales promotion today through the end of the year, which closes on January 4 aiming to be the more competitive in this very strong marketplace.
Our dealers told us customers appreciated the transparent pricing and ease of shopping that we had with our Friends and Neighbors event, but also recommended more balance in our overall incentive offerings, including affordable financing options, so we're making that a major component of our December programs.
Based on the feedback, we're moving to a new event that offers 0% financing for 60 months, plus a $1,000 holiday cash on select models, and those offerings are basically consistent with our year-ago levels. So we're looking forward to it.
With that, I'd like to turn over to Yong, for an update on the economic front. Yong?
Yong Yang
Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. In November, U.S. economic data indicated that the U.S. economy remained on a moderate, but a steady growth path.
The highlights are as follows. U.S. third quarter economic growth was revised up in the second estimate. The labor market rebounded with the unemployment rate reaching a new cycle low. Consumer income growth accelerated, boosted by higher wages. The housing market softened, but its improving trend will likely continue.
Consumer confidence improved further, thanks to better consumer finances. Here are some additional details. The second estimate of third quarter GDP came out better than previously reported revising up U.S. economic growth to a 2.1% annualized rate from 1.5% in the first estimate.
Consumer spending remained robust, growing at 3% annualized rate from the prior quarter, supported by decent real disposable income growth at a 3.9% annualized rate. Although, this investment was weighted down by reduced oil trading activity, residential investment growth picked up to a hefty 7.3% annualized rate.
In October, job gains rebounded to 271,000, which was significantly above expectations and also higher than the average monthly pace of 230,000 jobs over the prior 12 month. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 5%, reaching a new cycle low. Despite the two consecutive month of below expectations job gains in August and September, the labor market improvement had continued.
As the labor market recovery continues to mature and unemployment slack continues to diminish, the same stellar job gains as observed in October will likely become increasingly rare going forward. However, heightening labor market conditions will surely start to translate into more favorable wage gains for workers.
This is exactly what we have observed more recently, boosted by higher wages, personal disposable income grew 0.4% in October from the prior month, accelerated from [ph] a 0.2% of growth in September. That could lead to stronger consumer spending, as evidenced by the retail sales during the Thanksgiving and Black Friday weekend, which were up 3.7% from a year ago.
The housing market data turned a bit more mixed for October and November, suggesting some moderation in the housing market improving trend. More specifically, housing starts declined 11% from the prior month, but housing permit rose 4.1%, although home builder sentiment is 3 point to 62 in November. It remains the second highest level during the current cycle. Moreover, new home sales grew 10.7% from the prior month.
Despite the recent negative news surrounding global terrorist attacks, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment rose 1.3 point to 91.3. In addition, vehicle buy assessment rose 2 percentage points with a 70% of consumers citing now as a good time to buy a vehicle.
As Erich mentioned earlier, November total EBITDA sales were estimated in the mid-18 billion range, indicating that our industry remains on a healthy trajectory. With a year-to-date industry SAAR averaging about 17.8 million units, we expect 2015 industry sales will be largely in line with our guidance of about 17.7 million units.
With that summary, let me turn it back to Erich. Erich?
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Yang. And we're going to take a moment here to go through some housekeeping items. So we'll start off with our fleet as a percentage of our overall sales. If we take a look at the month of November 2015, our fleet as a percentage of our overall sales is 25%. That breaks out by commercial was 12%, government was 6% and daily rental was 7%. Comparing that to November 2014, we had, 24% of our overall sales were fleet. That breaks out with 11% commercial, 6% government and 7% daily rental.
Taking a look at calendar year-to-date. Calendar year-to-date November 2015, our fleet as a percentage of our overall sales was 28%. That breaks out by commercial 12%, government 5%, and daily rental 11%. Comparing this to November 2014 year-to-date, last year of course, fleet as a percentage of our total sales were 28%, and the breakout on that is 13% for commercial, 6% for government and 9% for daily rental.
Last item on the list here is we'll take a look at our gross stock, our inventory. So if we take a look at the month of November, we'll see that cars were 184,000; trucks were 310,000; SUVs were 171,000 giving us a total of 665,000 vehicles translating into a day's supply of 85. Comparing that to October 2015 cars were at 168,000; trucks at 302,000; SUVs at 152,000, giving us a total of 622,000 vehicles, translating into a day's supply of 79. Comparing November 2015 to November 2014, November 2014 last year we had 180,000 cars in stock; 267,000 trucks; 166,000 SUVs giving us a total of 613,000 vehicles. That translated into 79-day supply.
So with the housekeeping out of the way, Julie we're going to start taking some questions and we're going to start off with from the folks in the analyst community please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
John Murphy
Just a first question, the ATP increase of $3,800 is pretty impressive, especially relative to some fears around the Friends and Neighbor program. I was just curious, if you can tease out as much as you can, at least maybe directionally even the impact of mix versus like-for-like pricing on sort of your aggregate sales?
Erich Merkle
John, it was primarily driven, if you think of the Friends and Neighbors program, it's a formula, so it drives -- the discount from MSRP that the customer would see, looks better or is better on the more expensive vehicle, so the program was very effective on driving a rich mix. A lot of it was mix combined with an overall slightly lower incentive spend sequentially month-to-month, but it was uniform. We had great transaction pricing across the entire lineup on a month-to-month and year-over-year basis.
John Murphy
So you would say on your cars you actually had better pricing than you did necessarily on your trucks in this month on a year-over-year basis?
Erich Merkle
I'd have to dig into the specifics, but it was -- month-to-month and year-over-year we had transaction price increasing across cars, trucks, and SUVs. It was uniform across the lineup.
John Murphy
And then, Erich, just a second question. I mean, I think we're all familiar with the idea that there is a replacement cycle that has been helping sales for quite some time, but it seems like there might be a lot more legs left in the truck side. I'm just curious, if you've done any work on that?
And obviously, gas prices are helping mix to some degree here with a shift towards trucks, but it also seems like there might be a lot more to it with the replacement cycle with trucks being incredibly old. How much of that do you -- so how much of the strength in trucks do you ascribe to that replacement cycle and trucks continuing to chug along here?
Erich Merkle
Well, I'm going to ask Yong. I mean the replacement cycle on trucks, Yong, is I think around 12 years, if I'm not mistaken.
Yong Yang
Yes.
Erich Merkle
So the fleet is very old regarding trucks. So there is a tremendous replacement cycle that's out there taking place right now. And also, when you look at the housing industry, I know we saw some weakness here this last month, but housing still has a long way to go to get back to long-term trend, which would bode well for pickup truck demand as we move forward. We saw a strong pickup truck demand here in the month of November and we expect that to continue for this year into next year.
Yong Yang
That's correct. And at this point, the average age of trucks on the road is 11.8 years. So replacement is still a big component of the overall vehicles sales. In general, in the U.S., 80% of the vehicle sales are for replacement demand. So we still have a little bit of fuel in the tanks in terms of replacement demand.
John Murphy
And then just lastly, I mean we've seen a very significant inflection in miles driven during in the last 18 months, sort of a faster rate of increase than we've ever seen really historically. How much of that do you think plays into the strength in sales as well, because if this keeps up for a while, it seems like the lower gas prices and improved employment are going to really drive structurally higher demand that we are even seeing right now. How do you think about that miles driven sort of in your calculations for your forward estimates, Yong?
Yong Yang
Well, with the miles driven -- certainly with miles driven increasing, that's a good thing. It just means that people are going to wear out their cars faster. So I don't know if you see any immediate benefit to that, in let's say, over a four-week or a one-month period of time or even two months, but long-term, when people are driving more long-term, that generally bodes well for the industry and for sales.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays.
Brian Johnson
I want to talk a little bit about what's going on potentially in the Escape. Erich mentioned upfront that this is a hot category, yet we see 18% declines. So could you maybe kind of go through how did the friends and family play out in this? Are there fleet numbers we ought to be aware of distorting that, so what did retail versus overall look like for the Escape? And then are there any, in terms of either refresh or features or something that you can do to get a better share of that hot segment?
Erich Merkle
Brian, most of the decline for Escape for the month was fleet related, so it was pretty much all fleet timing related. As it played out with Friends and Neighbors, I'm going to hand that one over to Mark, but the decline for the month was really fleet timing related with fleet being down almost 50%.
Mark LaNeve
And in terms of performance for Escape, where Friends and Neighbors worked incredibly well in terms of driving a rich series mix, transaction pricing, efficiency of our spend. We had incredible internet activity in terms of interest leads, vehicle searches, et cetera. We found that it didn't work as well on Escape, Fusion, Focus, Fiesta.
And that's part of the reason, we're moving off of it for the month of December. But we still feel Escape has been a very solid performer for us all year and we think we have a great December with Escape. So we don't see any weakness in the product other than we just didn't have a low interest rate financing that those customers were looking for, which we will have in December.
Brian Johnson
So that was the dealer feedback that it's really the interest rates that are more important in CUV and the car category.
Mark LaNeve
In a year, where there has been a lot of 0% offers in the market by ourselves and in the competition certain parts of the market. And intuitively, you would think it would be more in the B, C, small utility category, are looking for the low financing alternatives, and while our program worked on many levels, we didn't have that component, so that's what we want to address in December.
Brian Johnson
Even though it can all mix out to the same place?
Mark LaNeve
Exactly.
Erich Merkle
Julie, next caller please.
Operator
The next one comes from the line of Bernie Woodall, Thomson Reuters.
Bernie Woodall
With the low gasoline prices, pickup trucks are in high demand. So I wonder if there is another side of that. The oil industry in Texas, as I understand, is seeing some of the lower bite, because of the -- what I'm trying to say is, low oil prices started to bite into the economy in Texas. Do you think that the oil industry downturn could actually hurt pickup truck sales in Texas?
Erich Merkle
Well, Bernie, certainly what you'll see is, if you take a look at nationally, you'll see where pickup truck growth is good in Texas. But you'll see that it's not as strong in, say, Dallas as it is in places like right now like Orlando and Miami, and San Francisco and also the North East. So it really ties more to the housing.
And when you start taking a look at it in its totality, I know Texas is a big market, I am not saying that it isn't, but if you look at Florida and California combined, they are the size of Texas. So it's really being offset by what has been really the strength in the housing industry in those other areas of the country.
Julie, another analyst call, please?
Operator
The next one comes from the line of Christina Rogers from Wall Street Journal.
Christina Rogers
I'm not an analyst, but just a very quick question. Forgive me, if you've already stated this. But what was your incentive spend in November versus year-over-year in October?
Erich Merkle
So our incentive spend in November versus year-over-year was flat, so unchanged. And compared to October it was down about $275.
Next caller, please?
Operator
The next one comes from the line of Nick Bunkley, Automotive News.
Erich Merkle
Julie, next caller, please?
Operator
Keith Naughton from Bloomberg.
Keith Naughton
Mark, I just wanted to follow-up on your good Escape analysis. Just to ask, who was it, among the competitors that is it Honda or Toyota that was offering the 0% deals on Escape that you feel like affected you? And do you feel like you now have effectively matched what they're offering?
Mark LaNeve
Keith, it wasn't more than we felt affected by any given competitor. It was more feedback analysis sort of looking at conversion of the internet leads, turn rates, feedback from dealers on certain parts of the market. And I characterized them earlier as C cars, B cars, small utilities that just the availability -- even if you're getting to the same payment by other means, just the availability of low interest financing, it's just a major component of the way customers are shopping now. It's been a major component of our play.
And on balance, there are many positives to the program, we felt better served by -- in the month of December, such a big -- it's a five weekend month, a very important month, a lot of activity, we're better served by having that as part of our incentive mix, which we didn't have as part of Friends and Neighbors in November. So it's not a lot more complicated than that, really.
Keith Naughton
And will this new program have an umbrella name like Friends and Neighbors or not?
Mark LaNeve
It's going to be our holiday sales event.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Nick Bunkley from Automotive News.
Nick Bunkley
When looking at Friends and Neighbors, I know it was obviously different than some of the programs in the past as far as employee pricing, but it's sort of at same kind of approach generally. And I'm wondering if it maybe says anything about how the market has changed in anyway, where that type of approach just doesn't resonate with consumers as much anymore versus people want 0% financing as opposed to getting a lower price on the actual car?
Mark LaNeve
Well, Nick, I wouldn't characterize it is not working. I mean, I think our performance and what we've seen on a retail basis is going to be right with the industry this month and it worked on many, many levels. It's built around clear transparent pricing. It was very well studied. We know there is a high degree of consumer interest. And then we had incredible interest in it, obviously worked incredibly well from a pricing and incentive efficiency standpoint of market, which is important to us every single month.
But we got strong anecdotal and actual analytical feedback that just is part of the equation that we're in right now and the way customers are shopping in many segments, that low interest finance by your captive finance, in our case Ford Motor Credit is a great partner as an important component. So we want to make sure that we have that included in a very critical part of December, very critical month of December.
Nick Bunkley
And can I also ask just how the last weekend of the month was compared to the rest of month, just given the tendency of the Black Friday to be --
Mark LaNeve
Month got progressively stronger, as we went through the month. And I think it probably did for the industry. And I think in our case dealers became more and more comfortable with the program that we are running, many of them had tremendous success with it. And we had a very strong final week. And it's a very short month. It felt like we blinked and it was over. There was only 23 selling days. But we had a very strong final weekend and our close yesterday was one of our two or three best days in the last seven or eight years.
Operator
Next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin from Associated Press.
DeeAnn Durbin
Erich, I heard you mentioned Millennials, and I just wondered if you could briefly tease out a little bit. Their strength in the market is sort of funny, because we've talked for a long time about how the conventional wisdom that was they weren't buying, and I am just kind of wondering about that aged group right now?
Erich Merkle
Well, what's interesting about that, Dee-Ann, is a lot of people have kind of a 10-year old notion of Millennials. They're just waiting on the curve for their mom to pick them up with the minivan with their skateboard under their arm. They've actually had grown since and they're older. So the oldest of them now are about 35 years of age.
So if you bifurcate the Millennials and you look at that population is about 25 to 34 years of age. They are going through kind of that average age for a woman to have her first child was 26; average age for a man is 28. So you've got a lot of them starting to have families.
And as they have families, their needs change, and they start looking for more utility in their vehicles, and that is one of the things and they've got more disposable income as well. So they start looking for more utility in their vehicles. They can spend a little bit more, because they're out of school, they've had a job now. They've been in the job market for a while. They're just in a different place than they were 10 years ago.
Dee Ann Durbin
Are they buying more than Boomers?
Erich Merkle
I wouldn't say they're buying more than Boomers. If you look at the percent of what they purchased, it's about 34% of what they purchased are SUVs. So that's a little higher than the average of about 33%. Again, that's the older Millennials 25 to 34 year olds. So you see that they are remarkably different, as they age, have children and have more disposable income.
