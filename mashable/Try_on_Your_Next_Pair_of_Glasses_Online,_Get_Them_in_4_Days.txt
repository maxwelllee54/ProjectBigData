Try on Your Next Pair of Glasses Online, Get Them in 4 Days
Jesse Draper is creator and host of The Valley Girl Show, through which she's become a spokesperson for startups and helped pioneer the way of new media content distribution. Formerly a Nickelodeon star, Draper is now CEO of Valley Girl, where she oversees the show and runs technology blog Lalawag.com.
Kate Endress, co-founder and CEO of Ditto, has created a technology to take the pain out of trying on glasses. Ditto lets you sample your specs online using a credit card as a measuring stick.  
To create the technology behind Ditto, Endress says she spent endless hours sitting in Lenscrafter's and optometrist offices studying people's "try-on" behavior. Ditto offers most designer brands of glasses including Vera Wang and Chloe. In addition, you can order prescription eyeglasses and receive them only four days later. 
If you don't trust your own judgement, the company also offer stylists to help you pick out and try on glasses that would be appropriate for your head shape. (According to Endress, everyone seems to think they are the one person with the oddly shaped head.) 
Endress' master plan for Ditto? "Over the next couple years I hope you see us trying to solve this for other categories."
