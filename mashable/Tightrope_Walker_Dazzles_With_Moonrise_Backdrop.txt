Tightrope Walker Dazzles With Moonrise Backdrop

We all know the dance, but this is an entirely different kind of moonwalk. 
In this video, accomplished climber, high-liner and BASE jumper Dean Potter scales Cathedral Peak in Yosemite National Park before walking a tightrope between two jutting rock formations. All of this in front of a beautiful background of the rising full moon.

Photographer Michael Shaefer captured the scene from more than a mile away as part of National Geographic Explorer's "The Man Who Can Fly." Schaefer used GPS and an app called The Photographer's Ephemeris to predict where the moon would rise relative to his vantage point.
