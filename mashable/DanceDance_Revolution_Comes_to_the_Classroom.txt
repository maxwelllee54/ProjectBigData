DanceDance Revolution Comes to the Classroom
It won't be long before students are playing video games at school. 
A new interactive fitness game announced at International CES 2013 brings at-home fitness video games to school. DanceDance Revolution Classroom Edition was made with school physical education class in mind. 
With the DanceDance Revolution games, users follow steps to dance choreography while listening to hit songs. Players hold a control that senses their movements or move on a mat, depending on the game console used. Players get points based on how close their moves matched-up to the ones on the screen. The fun calorie-burning game is played by both adults and children. This particular edition was made to bring that same idea to schools. 
This latest classroom version lets as many as 48 students play at one time. Each student must have a wireless mat that features a smart card reader to tracks each student's individual progress. The idea is that while students move to the beat, teachers can see their progress including steps, body mass index (BMI) and caloric burn rate. 
So far, the game has been launched at three schools located in Longwood, Fla., Gainesville, Ga., and Fresno, Texas, with assistance from KONAMI Digital Entertainment, Inc., which makes the game, and UnitedHealthcare, who it partnered with for this school edition.
