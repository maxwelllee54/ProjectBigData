Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Call. My name is Lisa and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Erich Merkle, U.S. Sales Analyst. Please proceed, sir.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Lisa. Good morning everyone and welcome to Ford's March 2015 sales conference call. Joining us today is Mark LaNeve, Ford's Vice President, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service and Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford's Chief Economist.
So if we take a look and dive right into the industry numbers, after reviewing early morning data this morning we see overall industry sales for March, including medium and heavy trucks totaling in the low 17 million vehicle range, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. We believe total sales on an absolute basis to be in the range of 1.54 million to 1.55 million vehicles. This would mean the industry is just slightly off or perhaps flat compared to a year ago.
It would appear retail represented approximately 81% of the overall industry sales in March. Overall, March industry trends remained largely aligned with the long-term trends. Once again passenger car sales were off as a percent of the overall industry compared to a year ago, small cars ran at about 19.2% of the industry, off several tenths [ph] from last year’s approximately 20%, mid-sized sedans represented just 13.4% of the industry relative to just over 15% a year ago.
Small SUVs continued to move as the segment represented 18.4% of the industry last month an almost two point increase relative to March of 2014. Based on the growth in small SUVs we anticipate the segment will again be poised to overtake the small car segment this year. Meanwhile the full-sized pickup truck segment had another strong month, representing almost 12.3% of the overall industry relative to about 11.6% in March of 2014. So that's kind of a real quick overview, 36,000 foot view of the industry. And now for a closer look at Ford and Lincoln I'm going to turn things over to Mark. Mark?
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, Eric. Good morning everyone and if you’re in New York at the Auto Show we appreciate you joining us on the call and I hope you’re enjoying the show. Looking at our results for the month of March our retail sales -- I’m going to start with retail, were up 1% in March, actually over strong March a year ago. So up 1%, making it our strongest retail March in nine years, we had the best March -- month of March in nine years.
Overall, Ford Motor Company U.S. sales in total were 235,929 in March, which is a 3% decline relative to 2014. This was a result of a fleet decline of 13%. Because as I said we were up 1% retail but down 13% in fleet. And very importantly the fleet decline was primarily based on order timing associated with the new F-150 and the manufacturing changeover we have left [ph] to do at our Kansas City truck plant.
In terms of retail, our newest product really provided the strength for March. F-Series and van sales provide strength on the truck side, while Explorer, Expedition and Mustang continued to really push higher, particularly with Mustang on the West Coast. And we began selling the first few new Edge models late last month and had a really great response from our dealers and customers on the new Edge. We continued to improve our F-150, that’s the new 2015 F-150 stock position on dealer lots, which last month resulted in very strong momentum as overall F-Series retail sales, overall F-Series retail sales were up 10% for the month.
The Kansas City assembly plant is now operating fully on three crews, as we build toward our full line speed this quarter, we’ll meet that later on this quarter and that would be largely responsible for building the F-150s that we need, that’s really how we get the availability configured for the commercial or fleet part of the business.
We completely remain on plan and we’ll be filling F-150 commercial fleet orders as the plant ramps up this quarter. Driven by the all new F-150, F-Series we will always get question on, so F-Series transaction price has increased $2,100 versus last year. As I travel around the country, I’ve been out quite a bit lately visiting with dealers, they are consistently talking about how customers love the new F-150, for its capability, technology, just the feeling of the vehicle, that’s been light weighted and its overall fuel economy.
As we said we expect a solid stock position of the truck by the end of the second quarter which will allow us to better meet demands of both retail and our commercial customers.
Moving on to vans, many who have been following our performance on vans which continues to be performing exceptionally well in the market. March was no exception. Van sales at Ford totaled 20,821 vehicles, almost 21,000 vans representing a 42% increase over last year. This is our best monthly sales of commercial vans going back to 1994. Transit Connect also set a new March sales record with 4,866 vans sold. That’s a 60% increase for Transit Connect. So we’re strong both for Transit and the Transit Connect.
For the quarter, I thought this number was noteworthy our van sales totaled 48,134 for Q1. This is a 37% increase compared to a year ago and our best commercial van performance since 1995. So for 20 years this is our best quarter in vans. So going back to my earlier point getting Kansas City up and running fully to meet commercial demand in trucks, in our F-Series will really be great, because than we can marry with what’s turning out to be just terrific start performance for Transit in the commercial markets. So getting the two really working together as we fill in that capacity is going to be fantastic for our business.
On the car side we continue to see success with Mustang since the vehicle’s launch. It’s become the best-selling sports car in America. We don’t have all the numbers obviously for competition for March, but the sports car segment was up approximately 21% through February this year with Mustang responsible for 61% of that growth. It represents one of every four sports cars that is now sold in America.
Mustang sales for the month of March were up 36% with strong retail increases coming from the West Coast. L.A Region was up 123%; San Francisco, 61% and the West Coast overall which includes the Pacific Northwest saw retail increase of 98%. So we had just a terrific market response Mustang across the whole country and especially in the critical West Coast market.
When it comes to Explorer, in our utility line-up we continue really selling as many as we can build. Last month sales were up 17% with 20,765 vehicles sold, representing Explorer’s best March performance since 2005. We are very enthusiastic about the new Explorer that’s coming later this year, that’s planned to go on sale late this summer and we will have all new platinum series addition that we are getting very -- lot of early interest in, as people build and spect online and we are really looking forward to getting that vehicle.
Moving on to Lincoln, obviously if you are in New York it was big news this week with the introduction of the Lincoln Continental concept. It’s just the latest chapter in the Lincoln journey signaling the future of quiet luxury and strongly hinting at the direction for a full size premium sedan coming next year. I know a lot of you got to see it and if you didn’t please make a point to see it firsthand. It’s a very, very impressive vehicle and a real good look into the future of Lincoln.
Getting back to the present in March Lincoln retail sales increased 7%. The new MKC continued to post impressive numbers with 2,070 vehicles sold last month. Navigator’s building on its sales success posting yet another strong month with sales up 47%. And so obviously an exciting time for our luxury brand as Lincoln continues to build momentum and get its plan in place for what we know will be a lot of success in the years to come. So with that I would like to turn it over to Emily for an update on the economic front. Emily.
Emily Kolinski Morris
Great, thank you Mark and good morning everyone. Well, the first quarter saw a string of mixed economic data with some moderation in housing and manufacturing indicators, while lower fuel prices continued to flow through confidence in spending data, despite the sequential uptick in pump prices.
Looking ahead we expect the firming labor market and still low fuel prices and interest rates to support renewed momentum and economic activity as spring takes hold. Growth in the manufacturing sector is steady but it’s being impacted by a variety of factors both positive and negative. Despite the recent rebound fuel prices remain low and continue to provide a significant boost to consumer disposable income, while employment conditions continue to improve, inflation’s well contained and long-term interest rates are likely to remain low given global financial market conditions, all of which is consistent with our outlook for U.S. GDP growth in the 3% range this year, although we may see again a little bit of weakness based on the first quarter data.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the details of the recent indicators. The March Purchasing Manager’s Index came in this morning at 51.5. That was down 1.4 points versus the February reading of 52.9. We had an unusually broad set of comments from survey respondents, noting residual effects from the West Coast port dispute with lingering weather factors, both positive and negative impacts from low oil prices while commodity prices overall continue to provide a favorable support for manufacturers. At this level the Index continues to indicate expansion in manufacturing activity over the coming months.
The final March reading from the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey eased 2.4 points from the prior month but remained 16% higher than this time last year. While lower income households have given back some of the January peak in confidence as gas prices have risen sentiment among middle and upper income households continued to increase in March.
Vehicle buying assessments declined modestly to about 66%, citing now as a good time to buy a vehicle and that included declines among upper income households with fewer references to low prices coming through in the March data. Consumer spending similarly softened in the early months of this year, February personal consumption expenditures showed a modest improvement after the decline in January but remained up just one tenth of a percent from the prior month.
Although the weak recent readings partially reflect lower spending on fuel, as reflected in the retail sales report a rise in the saving rate in February suggest that there was an underlying pause in spending during these two months. Personal income growth remained positive however and points to support for renewed spending gains this spring. In fact labor market conditions remained relatively favorable through the first quarter, despite a modest uptick in weekly jobless claims non-firm payroll gains averaged a robust 267,000 in January and February with the March reading of course due out this Friday and jobless claims more recently have fallen back below this 300,000 mark on a four week moving average basis, laying the ground for further payroll gains in the months ahead and providing an important support for the consumer spending outlook.
Overall despite the mixed economic performance in the first quarter we continue to see good fundamental supporting vehicle buying prospects in the coming months. So as mentioned earlier, total industry sale were estimated in the low 17 million unit range, on a seasonally adjusted basis and that includes medium and heavy-duty trucks. This would put the six months moving average at just around 17 million units, in-line with our full year forecast in the 17 to 17.5 million unit range.
So with that summary, let me turn it back over now to Erich.
Erich Merkle
Thank you Emily. And we're going to take care of a little housekeeping here before we move onto the answering some of the questions on the call here. When we take a look at our fleet business, when we look at fleet as a percent of our total sales, fleet as a percentage of our total sales for the month of March was 29%, commercial was 12%, government was 5% and daily rental was 12%. This compares to March of last year where fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 32%, commercial was 14%, government was 5%, daily rental was 13%.
Taking a look at calendar year-to-date, calendar year-to-date fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 29%, commercial was 13%, government was 5% and daily rental was 11%.
Taking a look at March 2014 year-to-date for last year's comparison, fleet as a percentage of total sales was 30%, commercial was 14%, government was 5% and daily rental was 12%.
Turning the page here and taking a look at our gross stock or inventory levels; for the month of March 2015 cars were at 203,000, trucks 241,000, utilities were at 171,000, giving us a total of 615,000 vehicles, representing a day’s supply of 68%. Looking and comparing that to February of 2015, cars were at 195,000, trucks at 240,000, utilities were at 168,000, giving us a total of 603,000 vehicles representing the day’s supply of 80. Taking a look at March of 2014 a year ago, cars were at 240,000, trucks 272,000, utilities 168,000 giving us a total of 680,000 vehicles a year ago. This translated into a day’s supply at that time of 72.
So now that we have the housekeeping out of the way Lisa we're going to turn things over and start taking some questions from the folks in the analyst community please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.
Daniel Levy
Hi. Good morning. This is Dan Levy on for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey there. Wanted to ask two questions, one on Escape and then the other one on F Series. Just on Escape, can you provide some context on Escape for the month, another soft month here. I assume a decent chunk of that is fleet. But can you give us a sense of how it did retail and how does that compare to the small utility segment which has been very, very strong?
Erich Merkle
Yes, Dan thanks for the question. In terms of Escape, retail was down slightly like 2%-3% right inline basically with our internal targets. We have somewhat tight supply as we continue to improve overall supply on Escape, but we still feel very strongly about the product. We have great consumer acceptance and obviously that segment, we continue to perform pretty well in share, but that segment’s a hot segment and we're continuing to work on our overall dynamics in terms of our fixed marketing spend and make sure we get adequate supply to meet demand.
Daniel Levy
Is it safe to say that as you build up your stock that there could be some payback in terms of higher retail sales later in the year?
Erich Merkle
We certainly hope so. We're running at about 48 day supply, which is tight for Escape. It's not dramatically tight but we like to be more up in this 60-65 range. So we feel pretty confident with increased supply that we'll continue to maintain our market share average. So we feel very good about Escape business.
Daniel Levy
Okay, and then just on the truck, a couple of things. First if you could just -- I apologize if I missed it early but if you could remind us the retail mix of the new F-150s versus the outgoing F-150s and then I believe you also said that F Series transaction prices are up $2,100. I assume that ATPs are being boosted by rich mix on the new trucks. Can you give us a sense of how the ATPs are on the outgoing F-150s? I assume it's still strong because of tighter supply and given -- if it's a case at these outgoing ATPs are strong, what's the charter you're hearing from customers on whether they go with an outgoing trucks versus holding off and paying a premium on the new truck?
Mark LaNeve
Okay I’ll take the first part of your question. So if we take a look at F-150 retail sales for the month Dan, 29% of our F-150 retail sales were made up of 2015 or the new model F-150.
Daniel Levy
Okay.
Erich Merkle
So that was 29% of the new -- of the F-150 sales were the new model. The 2,000 increase in our ATP is obviously a blended number. It's a personal finance decision and then preference on customer-by-customer, whether they want the ‘14 or to go with the new 2015. Economics obviously come into it, because generally speaking the 2015 will be higher just because of the incentives. Our incentive load on the '14 is actually very reasonable, below segment average and so a lot of the transaction price increase being driven by the new truck and that will temper and smooth out, as we give more availability. But we're very encouraged by the series mixes being chosen, customer acceptance and the way we're holding transaction pricing across our entire SUVs line up.
Daniel Levy
Okay, but you don't have the ATPs on the outgoing truck, that break out you don't have?
Mark LaNeve
No, we don't break it out to that level of granularity. We can tell you that the ATP for the F Series overall is approaching 41,000 last month. So we're getting really close to 41,000. And also when you start taking a look at incentive spend on say the outgoing model, when you start looking at days’ supply on F-Series, right now according to our plan, this is according to our plan, our day’s supply is under 60 days, about 58 days’ supply rate right now. So we're going to be working to build those stocks as the quarter progresses.
Erich Merkle
So it's pretty noteworthy we did 68,000 F-Series, almost 70,000 which is a huge month and when we're 56 days’ supply which by historic standards on the truck lineup we have all the cabin, power train configurations is very tight supply. So it shows a high turn rate and great sale amount of the '14 and a great consumer acceptance of the '15s. We're very, very pleased with it.
Daniel Levy
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Dan. Lisa next caller please.
Operator
Yes and your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Langan
Great, thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick follow-up. I mean I saw last month you indicated the days supply of the new F-150. Is that still turning as quickly as it was last month, any color there?
Erich Merkle
Yes, it's still at the same rate days to turns is at 18 for the month of March. And that is equivalent to the month of February. So it's still turning very fast as Mark mentioned.
Colin Langan
And then a second question, any color on overall ATPs to Ford versus the industry as well as within maybe the pick-up segment itself?
Erich Merkle
Sure if we take a look and just getting the data in front of me, but if we look at the overall incentive spend for the industry, industry incentive spend levels, they were up about $40 in March, on a year-over-year basis. Compared with February 2015 Colin they were down about $100. Average transaction prices in March were up about $1,100 from year ago and relatively flat with February 2015.
Now you also asked about Ford but if we take a look at Ford our incentive spend was very competitive in March. We were up about $280 relative to March of 2014 and up about $180 compared to February '15. But if you look at our average transaction prices our average transactions prices were up pretty significantly more than the overall industry. They were up over $2,000 compared with the year ago levels and about $260 compared to February 2015.
Colin Langan
Okay. And just one last question. Any color on the weather impact. There was obviously a question whether that was impacting February, do you think there was any catch up response or is it still an issue?
Erich Merkle
I don’t believe there was, Colin. I think, if there was an impact it was minimal. I think March, a year ago was more impacted. So I think a year ago March, the February we were in the deep freeze in many parts of the country. So I think March was kind of a breakout month a year ago, but this year I saw, in my opinion very little impact.
Colin Langan
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Colin. Lisa next caller please.
Operator
Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Patrick Archambault
Thank you, good morning.
Erich Merkle
Good morning, Pat.
Patrick Archambault
Just a couple for me. And one just on the car versus truck, at a really high level. Obviously cars, certainly down more than utilities and obviously trucks, so how much of that do you attribute to some of the segment shifts and how much of that is just to the fact that you pared back some your fleet activities for this particular month?
Erich Merkle
On a retail basis Pat we were up in utilities. And that’s really with tight supply across the board and really very few Edges. We’re getting sold down on the 2014 Edges. So we were up in utilities, trucks and vans, significantly so in trucks and vans. In cars we continue to see segment shifts from cars into utilities and trucks. And that on one hand, you look at the numbers. But on the other hand we’re very strong in utilities, trucks and vans. So that kind of market shift bodes well for Ford, but we continue to really work on our car line-up.
We had, in many ways a really strong performance from Fusion, when we look at what we project will be the market share numbers and the new Focus is just kind of getting out there in terms of availability of the new model, we’re kind of making the shift now this month into selling, I think more of a majority of the new models. So we’re encouraged about competitiveness in cars and the shift to utilities and trucks is a good thing for us.
Patrick Archambault
If I can just one follow-up to that and then another separate question. I mean, can you, forgive me if you gave it already. Do you have the retail in cars? I don’t know if that was broken out? And then just secondly the Explorer was obviously very, very strong given and it’s an older model. Was this one of these situations where they were some interesting promotions for the wind down of the older model ahead of the new launch, because that’s certainly out of your high volume vehicle seems like it was the best performing truck/utility?
Erich Merkle
No, Pat on Explorer, we didn’t really have any change in our go-to-market approach in both incentives and transaction, I supposed it’s mainly a result of we had more availability. It continuous to be so strong in the market that we kind of sold what we can build which is terrific. And in terms of cars I don’t believe we give -- I don’t believe we have -- I don’t have the split on the retail.
Mark LaNeve
No, not offhand. I can tell you Pat, if you take a look at, for instance like Fusion, which is one of our bigger players of course in the passenger car segment, the midsize sedan segment was down quite a bit, but if you look at our retail share for Fusion, was actually up seven tenths. So it’s a really difficult segment to be in March, but Fusion actually performed quite well, when you start taking a look at its retail share for the month.
Patrick Archambault
Got it, okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Thanks Pat.
Mark LaNeve
Thanks Pat.
Erich Merkle
Lisa, we’re going to take one more call from the analyst community then we’re going to turn it over to the folks in the media.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. There are no additional analysts to ask a question at this time.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Let’s open it up for the media folks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Snavely with Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
Brent Snavely
Hi, good morning guys.
Erich Merkle
Good morning.
Brent Snavely
I guess, I want to ask about the months and the industry, and I had thought coming out of February where the industry sales were a little below expectations that we might see a rebound in March. But you are expecting the industry to be flat or maybe down a little bit. So wondered basically what’s going on there and has the industry sort of plateaued and reached sort of full selling capacity?
Mark LaNeve
I invite Erich to give more of the macro part of that question. I could tell you that part of the industry -- are calling the industry being flat to slightly down as fleet, including our own which was purely a timing issue related mainly to getting Kansas City up and running and then -- but I have never put much stock in selling day adjusted but I can tell March of a year ago was a five weekend month, plus coming out of really tough weather over extended period of time. So I think last year’s, last March might have been a little more buoyant than maybe normal in terms of year-over-year comparisons but I think those are the big differences to me. I mean it didn’t -- it felt like s good solid month for the industry. Erich I don’t know if you want to comment further.
Erich Merkle
No, sure, thanks Mark. Essentially I think the comparison is a little bit difficult to March of last because of what happened with the weather and the comparison. But if you take a look at the quarter, for the quarter Brent we are looking at as a quarter that was up about 5%. So the industry on a quarterly basis, first quarter this year compared to first quarter last year is actually up and when you start to take a look at the growth as we go forward, keep in mind Emily had mentioned that on a six month moving average we are right around 17 million vehicles and our guidance for this year is 17 million to 17.5 million.
So you can see that we are looking at perhaps a little bit of growth this year but it’s not going to be like years past where we have seen the industry grow by a 1 million units year-over-year. So still some growth, solid industry but the rate of growth will slow just a bit.
Brent Snavely
Great, that helps. And if I may, I sense probably that you are on the call because of the New York Auto Show, so I mean just I hear you on the retail sales and the fact that you have pulled back on fleet but the cars, just Fiesta down 25%, Focus down 14.5%, Fusion down 11.5% you have covered it to some degree on this call but you just, on a sort of a macro car level is this something that people should be concerned about?
Mark LaNeve
I don’t -- I mean I think one thing we got to look at our share performance and the only one that I would be looking at, that I would say we got to work on is Focus and the big issue there is we are just now converting over to the new model, with our Focus -- because you have got the segment has been shifting which is a nice way of saying declining in terms of cars segment. So share becomes critically important and then I think it’s important to look at where we are in the lifecycle of our products.
Our newer products now, today or in the utility and truck line up and that’s we manage a whole portfolio, that’s perfectly normal and as we bring on fresh products like everybody you tend to effect share, in year-over-year gains when you have -- when you are in more of your launch mode rather than mid to late lifecycle. But we feel very bullish about our car line up and what we think as we move through the year and apply more fixed marketing to it, that we will be able to maintain good share performance.
Brent Snavely
All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Erich Merkle
Thank you Brent. Lisa, next caller please.
Operator
Yes, your next question comes from the line of Brad Wernle at Automotive News.
Brad Wernle
Hi, guys.
Erich Merkle
Hey, Brad.
Brad Wernle
Just another question on the F-150, wondering if -- you said demand is really strong. Is it stronger than you expected and if so is that creating any delay in you getting dealers stocks up to where they need to be. I think you said by April 50-50 on the old model and the new model.
Mark LaNeve
I don’t Brad, I don’t believe we get to 50-50. I think we get in the low 40s, the new model in April. Dealer stock we are still going to be tight for -- we are going to be tight for the next couple of months, so we prioritized dealer stock. We report and prioritized retail customers, which is part of the reason for the year-over-year fleet decline because we have yet to meet -- come anywhere close to meeting commercial fleet demand for the new truck.
But we are right on plan. I mean we have been signaling this for months and I think I indicated last call, that the plan that was laid out in terms of projected day’s supply and velocity of sell down of ‘14 and ramp up of ‘15 it’s just uncanny how close we are and I think we were projecting to be at 60 day’s supply at the end of April. Our total SUV’s [ph] were 56. So it’s almost you can’t shoot that straight. So we are right on target. We sold through a little bit quicker which is a good thing in March and we are continuing our manufacturing team to ramp it up and get us availability of the new ones.
So we are -- that situation is going to improve every single day.
Brad Wernle
Great, thanks.
Erich Merkle
Thank you Brad. Next caller please Lisa.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with Associated Press. Please proceed.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Hi, good morning guys.
Erich Merkle
Good morning.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Hi, Brent actually asked something similar to what I was going to ask. So I'll just ask you Erich, do you expect other quarters this year will see 5% increases or was this -- was the first quarter possibly the best we're going to see, because we've sort of been expecting for a long time that the percentage increases were going to go down, we're approaching this $17 million. I'm just wondering where it starts and does it start now or what do you predict for the rest of the year?
Erich Merkle
Sure, well. If you look at it Dee-Ann, I'm not going to give you a quarter-by-quarter projection unfortunately thus far. But right now, I mean I think Emily said it best, as the six month moving average rate is now about 17 million and the first quarter is up 5%. And if you look at that six month moving average of 17 million and our guidance is for 17 million to 17.5 million, you could reasonably anticipate, maybe some slight or modest growth as we move forward this year. But again it's not going to -- we're not going to see the robust growth that we've seen coming out of the recession of 2009. So…
Dee-Ann Durbin
Yes, okay thanks.
Erich Merkle
Okay thank you Dee-Ann. Lisa we're going to take one more caller and we're going to call at a wrap.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Stoll with Wall Street Journal. Please proceed
John Stoll
Hi, guys. If you could talk a little bit about some of what you're seeing in the competitive activity. Toyota has continued to surge here, I don't know how much of that is built on just popularity of Lexus an area where they've had some focus. So there has been some speculation that they would pour on incentives at the end of the fiscal year. I would imagine some of the share activity going on and some of the changes, Toyota maybe taking some share from Ford. So what do you seen in particularly with Toyota and then larger non-D3 auto makers right now, that's pressuring or influencing the environment?
Mark LaNeve
John, I mean I’d characterize it as the market is really competitive. As some of the sales growth -- I mean it's been a terrific five year run, since you go back to '09. So it's historic in many ways. So the market, the 70’s [ph] a very healthy industry. To Erich's point you're not -- we're not going to see the growth curves that we saw maybe earlier in the decade. So it's going to be really competitive, we expect that. But I don’t see anybody that's out there sitting back. I think everyone’s, whether it's fixed spend or variable spend they're doing what they can to hit their numbers and try to gain shares. So we're competing with the rest of them. And we felt like in March we competed pretty well.
John Stoll
Does it concern you, although I mean there is obviously a lot of discussion about the weak yen right now and what that does for pricing power and what does for particularly Toyota. I mean let’s talk about specifically that competitor, they're knocking on your door and I'm not sure if they surpassed you for number two in the month, but they're up 5%. So as you look at them what kind of threat are they, I mean they've never gone away regardless of time -- but they seem to be roaring back right now.
Mark LaNeve
I worry about everything John, not just that. Toyota is -- the Japanese competitors have been strong since I entered the industry. There’s never been a time when they haven't been strong competition. And I anticipate they will continue to be good competition. I do think that the shift in the utilities and trucks serves us well because we're very well positioned from a portfolio line up market position, brand favorability, pricing power, regional lack of regional variation in our utility and truck and outside. I think some of those shifts that we're seeing are good for our company and so we continue to focus really heavily on improving our competitiveness in cars which we’ve made some great progress on.
John Stoll
Okay thanks. It’s good to talk to you again Mark.
Mark LaNeve
