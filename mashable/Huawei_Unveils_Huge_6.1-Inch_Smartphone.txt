Huawei Unveils Huge 6.1-Inch Smartphone
LAS VEGAS — Chinese manufacturer Huawei announced at the 2013 International CES the Ascend D2 smartphone and the 6.1 inch-Ascend Mate smartphone-tablet hybrid.
The news comes just a few days after leaked images of the devices popped up online.
First up is the mammoth Ascend Mate — which will go up against the Samsung Galaxy Note II — features a quad-core 1.5GHz processor and a 4050mAH battery. The display has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. Under the hood, the Ascend Mate runs Android 4.1.
It's also gargantuan at 6.1-inches. 

Meanwhile, the Ascend D2 is Huawei's chance at taking on the superphone market. The Ascend D2 has a 5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. That gives it the same pixel density as the HTC's Droid DNA on Verizon.
Like it's bigger sibling, the Ascend D2 runs on Android 4.1 and has a quad-core 1.5GHz processor. In addition to a 13-megapixel backside illuminated camera and a 3000mAh battery, the Ascend D2 was built to be water resistent. Huawei demonstrated its ability to work under wet conditions by throwing water on the device during the press conference.

We don't have any word on price or country availability of these devices but it looks like Huawei will start shipping soon. With any luck, 2013 will be Huawei's year to break out into the mainstream.
Is a 6.1-inch smartphone too big or is it just the right size? Let us know in the comments.
