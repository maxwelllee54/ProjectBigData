Philips Packs Removable Surround Speakers Into a Soundbar
LAS VEGAS — Fans of surround sound detest the proliferation of single-speaker soundbars, but there's no question they're convenient. What if you could have the best of both worlds: a simple soundbar for your casual listening, but with removable surround speakers for when you want those immersive sound effects?
That's exactly what the Philips Fidelio soundbar is. At 46 inches long, it's one of the lengthier soundbars, but it gets a tad shorter when you detach the surround speakers from both sides. With the two speakers removed, the center unit retains the front, left and right channels. The surrounds are wireless, so no worries about tripping over cables.
Place on end tables or hung on your walls, the surround speakers have enough juice for about 10 hours of listening, and they start recharging the instant you put them back on the main unit.

You can get the Fidelio soundbar with or without a separate subwoofer, which is also wireless (though obviously it, like the main unit, needs a power cord). Coming in May, they cost $799 with the sub (HTL9100) and $599 without (HTL7100). They're separate products, with different sound processing, so it'd be a bad idea to get the standalone unit and pair a sub later.
We love the idea of a soundbar that includes surrounds when you want 'em — perfect for apartments where space is limited.
