Samsung Intros 85-Inch UHD TV With a Quad-Core Processor Inside

LAS VEGAS â€” Samsung rolled out the world's largest 4K ultra-high definition TV (UHD TV) Monday at CES 2013, offering four times the resolution of 1080p high-definition displays. 
Since there is hardly any 4K programming yet available, the Samsung  UN85S9000 UHD TV uses a quad-core processor to upscale 1080p programs to its lofty resolution. 
The UN85S9000 adds unique features such as voice interaction that lets you control it by speaking to it in complete sentences, and Smart View that lets you stream content from your mobile devices to the TV screen.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature announced for this product is its ability to link the TV with other Samsung smart home appliances. This feature will allow you to do gee-whiz things such as monitor your wash cycle (if you have a Samsung's smart home washing machine), or adjust your thermostat, all with an app that you can watch on screen without needing to pause the program you're viewing.
The TV helps you find programs with Samsung's S-recommendation lists, which the company says will let you browse through thumbnails of  "suggested content." 
Of course, those who might purchase this TV will be concerned about obsolescence of its internal processor and software, so Samsung included the smart evolution Connector, allowing users to upgrade as technology improves.
It's a highly capable TV with an impressive features list, but what was missing? Perhaps the most important thing: the availability date and a price.
