Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Ford Monthly Sales Call. My name is Jasmine and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Erich Merkle. Please proceed.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Jasmine. Welcome to the Ford’s August 2015 sales call and good morning everyone. Today, we’re joined by Mark LaNeve, Ford’s Vice President, U.S. Marketing Sales and Service; and Yong Yang, Ford’s Senior U.S. Economist.
Taking a look at the numbers for the month. Based on early incoming data, we estimate that total industry sales including medium and heavy trucks are coming in around 1.57 million to 1.58 million vehicles for August. This translates into a total industry SAAR in the high 17 million vehicle range. This places the industry slightly behind August 2014; we estimate approximately 1% to 3% behind. It’s important to note though that Labor Day weekend last year was reported in August, while this year it was counted in -- it will be counted in September sales results. The industry sales mix appears to be about 16% fleet and 84% retail for the month of August.
Taking a look at some of the trends in the marketplace, we continue to see very strong growth in the small utility segment. The segment represented 19.5% of the industry in August. This is higher than July and a full 2 points higher than last year’s 17.5% of industry. The small utility segment is higher than small cars, which are about 19% of the industry as of last month. Small cars dropped to full 2 percentage points in August from 21% of the industry last year. Mid-size cars represented approximately 14% of the industry last month compared to last year’s 15.5%.
Taking a look at full-size pickups, they had a strong August, which further reinforces our optimism that we talked about last month for the segment in the second half of the year. Full-size pickups represented about 13% of the industry last month, which compares very favorably to 11.3% at this time last year.
So now that we’ve taken a look at some of the industry highlights here, I’m going to turn things over to Mark; and he is going to give us a little more color around Ford and Lincoln for the month.
Mark?
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, Erich. Good morning, everyone and happy September to you.
Ford Motor Company, U.S. August sales totaled 234,237 vehicles. That was a 5% increase against really a very tough comparison a year ago due to the timing of Labor Day, which is a big sales weekend, as Erich mentioned. So, we’re very pleased with that result. Of that total, notably 183,467 was retail. This represented our best total retail volume -- best retail monthly performance of any month since March 2006. So, it was a very strong retail month and fleet month for both sides of the business.
Our newest products continue to deliver and build momentum for us. That’s what we think drove our results in the month of August. F-Series had a very strong sales month, posting more than 70,000 sales for the first time this year and really since the first time, obviously that we completed the plant changeovers and starting to get very regular cadence of new production. Any time we do 70,000 F-Series, that’s a big number; it represented our best August for F-Series going back to 2006. And when we do 70,000, it’s happened like seven times in the last eight or nine years, to give you little perspective, so, a big number for us, really strong in both F-150 and Super Duty, which I’ll come back to in a minute here.
The all new Edge and new Explorer continue to turn very fast on dealer lots and had excellent results, year-over-year results for the month. Commercial vans continued to deliver very strong results. All new Mustang, which has been just a great performer for since its launch, had another terrific month, and Lincoln produced another month of sales increases. Our new vehicles are beginning to start to produce solid share gains along with overall increases in average transaction prices which is obviously great for profitable growth.
Let’s move on to F-Series specifically. We gained a point of retail share in August compared to July and compared to a year-ago in an expanding truck segment, as Erich mentioned. So F-Series retail sales and share are now back -- basically back to the levels that we were achieving before we had the extended plant changeovers. We continue to see sales increases as our inventory position strengthened. We’ve been talking about that regularly on these calls. August represented our first month F-Series sales above 70,000, as we mentioned since completion of the changeover because we had a much better inventory position and product growth throughout the month as we’re starting to get an entire plant and system filled. As we mentioned last month, we’re filling our dealer lots and will begin feeling more commercial fleet orders as we move through the end of the year. That’s still really upside for us in our plans.
We ended the month -- to give you some perspective on inventory, we ended the month with 90,000 F-150s in inventory, much better number than we had in May and June but still not at optimal levels, and just to give you some perspective on the 90,000, we were at 173,000 last year, on September 1st. And that was a little bit high as we were stocking up to the changeover but still operate in less than half of the inventory although at a much better absolute number than we were running in Q2. And that we ended the month with a 55 day supply of F-150s which is a relatively low number, but just shows you how quickly the vehicle is turning. So, we’re delighted with customer acceptance and turn rates.
Moving on to Ford SUVs, we totaled 69,000 -- 69,077 SUVs in August; that’s a 12% increase year-on-year and the best August performance for Ford brand SUVs since 1994. Much of that is driven by strong demand for exploring Edge, and Escape continues to run very strong in the market despite being later in its lifecycle. A couple numbers, Edge is turning on dealer lots in just 20 days, posting a 36% increase in sales year-on-year and really we’re selling them off the truck. If we had more, we’d have posted a bigger number in the month of August.
Same with Explorer, it pushed above the 20,000 vehicle mark gain in August for the fourth straight month, and we’re seeing very strong days of turn on Explorer as well with 16 days on average, and again we had dealers reporting that they would have done more with spot shortages dependent on the dealership but running very lean with incredibly high SVAs which shows we can do it and still post these kind of results. Explorer sales totaled 21,658 last month that was a 22% increase for Explorer and the best August sales performance since 2004. Escape performed really well, as I mentioned, continues to. The 2016 model year Escape is turning into 16 days, and we’re achieving excellent results on that vehicle as well with very high SUV turn -- with very high inventory turns.
We came within -- on Escape, we came within a 126 units at an all-time August record; and our utility, we ended our total utility business, which include Edge, Escape, Explorer, Flex, and Expedition. We ended the month with 38-day supply, which is an incredibly low number. And I think the team is very proud including our dealers as we posted these kind of high volume numbers and increases with those kind of turn rates which is something that traditionally, we haven’t done but we’re getting much better at it.
Van sales were really strong last month, up 70%, providing our best August performance for commercial vans since 1994. Gains were coming with the overwhelming success with Transit and Transit Connect which achieved its best August sales results ever. Vans continue to be a huge part of our business, a growing part of our business; we’ve been hovering around that above -- just above or just below the 20,000 unit mark, almost the entire year. So, it’s incredibly good business for us. We’re proud of our long history in the segment, and success of the Ford for Transit and Transit Connect and given our customers fuel economy capability and really the kind of configurations and flexibility in the overall package that the commercial customers are really looking for. So, it’s a vehicle, despite this good performance, we still think it has upside.
Mustang continued to ring the bell and had sales of just under 10,000, 9,997; that’s a 70% increase versus a year-ago; continued to perform incredibly well in California where sales were up 70%. That was a Southern California and then Northern California up 67%. So, part that vehicle that just month in month out has performed great and is doing exceptionally well in the key coastal markets.
Year-to-date for Mustang were up 106% in California. We also saw big gains in Florida, up 101% in Miami area and up 104% in the Orlando area. So, people are really telling us that they love the design; they love the way the vehicle is packaged; obviously performance is a given and we continue to get an incredibly high tech rate on the EcoBoost engine.
Moving on to Lincoln: Another strong month for the Lincoln brand, sales were up 6% in August with 8,636 vehicles sold. This represents Lincoln’s best August performance in seven years. We believe -- don’t have all the numbers yet, but we believe that’s against the backdrop of an overall luxury industry that’s going to be down slightly, year-on-year. So, the 6% stands up very well against the overall luxury market. We’re seeing strong growth in SUVs on the Lincoln side as well. Lincoln SUV sales were up 17% last month, totaling 5,513 vehicles. MKC had another great performance, up 37%. And Navigator sales were up 79%. Lincoln MKX, we’re just getting them into dealer lots; it’s turning in 18 days; very, very strong reception by our customers and the dealers. So, we’re looking forward to full availability. That’s a tailwind for us in the back half of the year -- excuse me, in the last four months of the year in the Lincoln brand.
So, that’s a look at August sales highlights; very strong month for us. And I’d like to turn it back over to Yong for an update on the economic front. Yong?
Yong Yang
Okay. Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. In August, U.S. economic data continued to be positive, suggesting the U.S. economy remains on a strong footing [ph] despite a recent turmoil in the global financial market.
U.S. second quarter economic growth was revised up in the second estimate with the improved consumer spending and investment. The labor market continues to improve at a steady pace. The housing market momentum has been sustained. Consumer confidence eased but remains at high levels. Interest rates experienced some volatility but they settled near prior month levels as the investors anticipated a first Fed rate hike. That said, let me give you some more details.
Based on the second estimate, the second quarter GDP growth coming in at a 3.7% annualized rate, much stronger than the prior estimate. Consumer spending grew at a 3.1% annualized rate upon the prior quarter, up from 1.8% in the first quarter as consumers continue to benefit from low fuel prices, low inflation and low interest rates. Now with the substantial investment, increased at 3.2% annualized rate, up from 1.6% in the first quarter. Despite strong dollar, net exports added 8.2 percentage points to the second quarter GDP growth compared to subtracting 1.9 percentage points in the first quarter. Although concerns for China’s slowdown have caused a lot of financial market volatility in recent weeks, the impacts of China’s slowdown on the U.S. real economy is likely modest, given that global financial markets appear to be stabilizing under the U.S. economy only has limited reliance on exports to China.
In July, job gains continued at a healthy albeit moderated pace after a strong performance in the prior two months. Total employment growth coming in at a 215,000, relatively in line with expectations. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at a cycle low of 5.3%. Furthermore, the most recent four-week moving average jobless claims were 272,000, relatively unchanged from a month ago when we had our July sales call. We expect that the labor market improvement will continue. Of course we will be able to find it out when August employment is released later this week.
The housing market in July sustained its momentum observed in the prior month. Housing starts rose 0.2% from prior month. Although housing permits declined 16.3% from the prior month due to the expected expiration of New York tax exemption program. They remained 7.5% higher than a year ago and continue to be above the 1 million mark. Moreover, new and existing home sales increased 5.4% and 2% from the prior month respectively.
The improving housing market, which was lagging previously, is providing another source of growth for the U.S. economy and our auto industry, especially our pickup sales. The August University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment declined 1.2 points from the prior month to 91.9. The easing in consumer sentiment is largely attributed to near term volatility in financial markets. Despite the easing, consumer sentiment remains relatively robust. Vehicle buying assessments were also positive with the 66% of consumers citing now as a good time to buy a vehicle. As the volatility in financial markets steps aside in coming weeks, consumer sentiment will likely turn more positive.
Of course there are areas in the U.S. economy that are still lagging in terms of improvement. One notable example is income growth. Despite the improving labor market conditions, average hourly earnings grew 2.1% year-over-year in July, stuck in the tighter 2% range ever since the beginning of recovery. To some extent that is a reflection of a lack of labor productivity improvement. However, as labor market conditions continue to tighten up and business investment beefs up labor productivity, income growth will eventually pick up and provide a further boost to consumer spending.
Just to recap, as Erich mentioned earlier, August total industry sales were estimated in the high 17 million range; this illustrates the underlying strength of our industry. Improving economic fundamentals should continue to support job growth and a good environment for vehicle buying. As a result, the industry performance will stay strong throughout 2015. With the year-to-date industry sales averaging $17.5 million, we expect that 2015 industry sales to come in at the upper end of our $17 million to $17.5 million range including mid and the heavy trucks.
With that summary, let me turn it back to Erich.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Yong. Taking care of a few housekeeping items here, so we’ll take a look at gross stocks. Turning to gross stock, in August of 2015, we had 161,000 cars in gross stock; 263,000 trucks; 134,000 utilities, giving us a total of 558,000 vehicles, translating into 62-day supply. Comparing that to July 2015, we had 167,000 cars in gross stock; 255,000 trucks; 138,000 utilities, giving us a total of 560,000 vehicles. This translated into a day supply of 65. Comparing August of 2015 to year ago August of 2014, we had 155,000 cars in gross stock August 2014; 307,000 trucks; 124,000 utilities, giving us a grand total of 586,000 vehicles. This gave us -- translated into a day supply of 75.
Taking a look at our fleet, as a percentage of our total sales for the month of August, overall 22% -- 22% of our sales were represented by fleet. 11% of that -- or 11% was commercial; 5% was government; and 6% was daily rental. Comparing that to August of 2014, 20% of our total sales were fleet that would be 10% commercial; 6% government; and 4% daily rental.
Looking at year-to-date, August 2015 year-to-date, 29% of our total sales were fleet; 12% commercial; 5% government; and 12% of our total sales were daily rental. Compare and contrast that to August 2014 year-to-date, it was the same. It was 29% of our total sales were fleet; 13% was commercial; 6% was government; and 10% was daily rental.
So now that we have the housekeeping items taken care of, Jasmine, we’re going to turn things over here. We’re going to start taking some questions from the folks in the analyst community please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
John Murphy
Just a first question, given all the volatility that we’ve seen in the last week or two, just curious how the month finished up, and particularly, the last weekend of the month from showroom traffic and actually conversions of sales.
Mark LaNeve
It was fairly steady throughout the month, but -- I mean it was strong throughout the month. Ironically with all the volatility you just mentioned, it was very strong at the end. We had a terrific last weekend and a terrific day yesterday, cleaning up the weekend. So, we finished very, very strong.
John Murphy
That’s great news. Then a second question, if you think of the F-Series, I don’t think as you mentioned, sort of the fleet retail split that you had in the month or maybe you did but also just curious what is more normal and what we could expect as you ramp up on inventory through the end of the year.
Mark LaNeve
We were up 15% retail on F-Series for the month, and we were -- which is a really good number considering still tight on inventory, and we were down in fleet. And we would expect to start having year-over-year fleet increases as we’re able to fill those orders as both plants get running fully, which will obviously help our overall number because we’ve been prioritizing retail, both orders and our inventory over some of the fleet business. But that’s a tailwind for us in the back half of the year, because we fully expect that to post increases.
John Murphy
Do you have the mix numbers; what percent was retail and what percent was fleet and what is sort of more normal?
Mark LaNeve
We had, of the 71,000 -- about 70% retail, 30% fleet. We would typically run more 60-40.
John Murphy
And then just lastly, the Transit has been wildly successful. I mean there was a lot of fears as the E-Series was being canceled and wound down, although obviously you are still selling a few of those. Just curious what you think is driving the success of that product. Is that competitors backing away the success of that product or is that market just really red hot right now, because that really is a very, very good news story there?
Mark LaNeve
On -- John, I’ll make a correction, we were 80% retail and 20% fleet. So, we would -- we were highly skewed retail on F-Series; we typically run much more in 60% to 65% range on total F-Series which obviously includes Super Duty which has a high degree of fleet. On Transit, I think it’s a couple of things. First of all, we’ve got a great product. It’s been hugely successful in Europe for years. We’ve got the latest technology in the vehicles; we’ve got two different wheel bases; three different roof heights; unbelievable amount of configurations for storage, seating, windows, power train, et cetera. You are seeing -- it takes full advantage of product like that of the urbanization moves; we’re seeing the emergence of small businesses driven by internet, mobile technology, and what have you where you’ve got to have the security of a closed backend. We have very little competition in the segment. GM doesn’t have a product like that neither does Toyota and Honda. So, we feel we’ve got a great distribution network. Dealers that know how to sell them, a great commercial team here in Detroit. So, it’s a strong business for us and one that as well as we’ve done, we believe has upside moving through the next four to five years.
Erich Merkle
Jasmine, next caller please.
Operator
That comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.
Dan Levy
This is Dan Levy for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a couple questions on large pickups, both related, one on incentives, the other on ATPs. First question is, mid-month incentive data show that your incentives on large pickups were up quite significantly, both year-on-year and sequentially. I don’t have a sense historically, but I think this is the highest monthly levels for Ford in at least the last four years. And I get it, most of us expected the spend to come up, given you are working off tough comps and your inventory is starting to normalize. And your ATPs have been pretty healthy amidst the higher incentives, but what can you say to provide us with some comfort that as supply further increases, that incentive spend will remain in check and won’t be an issue?
Mark LaNeve
It’s a good question, Dan, and I would characterize it as we were so abnormally low on incentives -- excuse me, on inventory through really the entire year, calendar year, up until about July that a big increase or to get to a more normalized level of incentives, which is where I feel we’re at now would have been counterproductive financially, as we wouldn’t have got the sales lift just due to the lack of inventory. So, even though we’re still, in my opinion, tied or not at optimal levels, we did feel moving into July and August that we had adequate, absolute numbers on the ground plus good product flow coming from the two plants to begin to get more price competitive. It’s a high volume market, a lot of them are work trucks bought for personal use or work use, or work use exclusively. So, it’s a highly contested, highly cross shopped market. So we feel, we’re in sweet spot. We might have run a little bit higher in August, because we included it in our Free Ride Labor Day event, but it’s not -- it was a move of several hundred dollars, not several thousands. So, we feel good about where we are at, and we don’t see any escalation on the horizon in terms of getting to some other level as we continue to improve our overall inventory as well.
Dan Levy
What was the August number, incentives?
Mark LaNeve
What August number?
Erich Merkle
For the August number for incentives, Dan, for F-Series, overall, you’re looking about $4,700, which was in line with the overall segment. And when you start looking at the average transaction prices, they were at 42,500, [ph] which was $2,000 higher than the year ago.
Dan Levy
And my question on ATPs, and certainly acknowledge that we had very strong ATPs here. I think we’ve been a bit spoiled because especially in recent months your ATPs have been particularly high, even above tough comps. And it’s a combination of good mix and tight supply but as your inventories normalize and you are starting to change your mix to be slightly dilutive, how should we be modifying our expectations vis-à-vis ATPs? Clearly, ATPs in the $42,000 range may be tough to sustain, but is something in the $40,000 range, which is above where you were tracking in 2012 and 2013 and is a bit more in line with 2014; is that still achievable?
Mark LaNeve
Dan, I feel like the month of August is a pretty representative month. We knew it would -- we had an incredibly rich mix starting out the year. It’s moderated -- if you really go back and look at, it’s moderated every month to some degree to this point that we were in August. We still have -- we still like to fill out the inventory a little bit more than we have, especially with some of the work truck which transacts at a lower level. So, it may moderate slightly as we are able to fill dealer inventory with those kind of products. But August pretty represented a month. So, there is nothing -- you are going to see nothing dramatic in terms of swings moving to the back half of the year.
Dan Levy
Even as you reduce mix to more of the lower trim stuff?
Mark LaNeve
Yes, because we still sell -- on the margin, it’s a very small percentage, what I would call that red cab lower work truck. It’s a small percentage of what we sell compared to XL, XLT, Lariats King Ranches et cetera. It’s actually upside volume for us. I think it’s volume we’re missing because it’s not then get replaced. If that’s what customer can afford, he’s not moving up to something else that’s available just because it’s available.
Erich Merkle
Jasmine, we’re going to take one more caller from the analyst community, then we’re going to turn it over to folks from the media.
Operator
Your next questioner comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Rod Lache
I just had two questions, one is I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what you’re seeing within pickup truck demand and some of the questions that we have been kind of contemplating is obviously Texas is like 15% of pickup trucks, something like that and oil price is down. Does that have an effect on demand in that market or within the ag market, which I think is also material for pickup trucks, farm incomes have been down. Just generally commodity prices have been lower and does that have any effect on the mix of sales that you see within pickup trucks?
Mark LaNeve
Rod, I’ll answer the first answer and then I’d like Erich or Yong to jump in. We see really strong demand for pickups. We feel like we’ve had a little pent up demand as our customers have been waiting for dealers to get more adequate inventory and of the kind of the vehicle that they are looking for many pickups or ordered specifically to specific spec and we’re starting to deliver those. As well as there is probably customers who are waiting for us to improve our overall incentive level. They probably bought some of them in the market in July and August as previously we were transacting at far beyond our normal premium in the marketplace. So, housing activity is steady to improving. The Texas and some of the oil belt, Louisiana, Texas economy seem to have at least assimilated the steady state that we are at. I’m not an economist; I can’t comment on that. But we felt like we had great pickup demand start to finish really July and August. And like I said, 70,000 is a big number, we only do that on average about once a year. So, we got by that fairly easily and we’re delighted with customer acceptance of the vehicle. And that’s where I feel really good is that I continue to get letters, comments with dealers meetings. We’re going to be with all of our dealers this week, just on how much customers love this new truck. And in the end that’s what’s going to sustain us despite economic ebbs and flows.
I don’t now Erich if you have anything to add.
Erich Merkle
We’ve pointed this out on past calls, Rod. We understand that the oil and gas industry is a little on its heels on right now. But when you look at housing and you start to look outside of Texas, the second largest market for pickups is California, third is Florida and there is just a lot of construction going on right now which is really helping the segment.
Rod Lache
And just one other just comment on -- or question on pricing. Maybe you can help us square this. Obviously the demand is quite strong. And it seems like this is generally being driven by organic growth, not generally requiring a lot of incentives and yet we have incentives up above -- I think they were north of 10% of average transaction prices for the first time since 2010, this past month. So, is there any rationale for boosting it like this; are you seeing enough price elasticity of demand to warrant the increase in incentives overall?
Mark LaNeve
It’s an incredibly high volume segment and it’s incredibly hotly contested in cross shopped, mainly between ourselves and entries from GM and RAM. And it’s segment that’s highly merchandised and advertised, not just at a national level but at a dealer, at group level, Tier 2 and Tier 3. So, if you are not in the game, you are going to get hurt from a standpoint of overall volume. And obviously earlier this year between inventory and very high transaction price, we were demanding, we saw some of that. So, if the market equation we have to hit with pickups that we think works is high volume at a premium in the marketplace with the best truck and that’s where we’re hitting. And like I said, if you really look at the numbers for August, it’s a pretty representative number. It will moderate up and down a little bit as we move through back half of the year and the year-end sales events but I don’t see any dramatic swings on the horizon, certainly not up.
Erich Merkle
Jasmine, we’re going to turn the things over to the media community now and take our first call from media please?
Operator
Next questioner is Alisa Priddle, Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
Alisa Priddle
Actually you touched on a lot of my questions but I just wondered if there is sort of -- you say that you’re not going to make any dramatic changes in how you attack incentives. But is it something that you need to sort of tweak and kind of move your money around between trim levels, geographic areas that kind of thing?
Mark LaNeve
We do that constantly. The incentive mix in the industry, I’ve been doing it long time, it’s actually fairly complex. Now we’ve got incredible amount of advanced analytics and data to help us get more specific and more efficient in our media spend. But if you think about cash, APR, lease, combos of those things, private offers, inventory specific programs that some of our competitions doing, it can be really complex. And we have a price strategy for each of our vehicle. And we try to stay on that price strategy. It includes our overall MSRP and an appropriate level of incentives. And we always want them to be lower but we need to compete in the market and provide great value for our customers and keep our dealers competitive. And we intend to keep doing that. I’m just saying I see such strong demand for the Ford brand that I don’t see any dramatic swing upward certainly in the marketplace as we move forward.
Alisa Priddle
And just one other thing. Obviously we’re in a period of UAW talks and every time there is a new contract, there is always obviously a possibility of strike. Are you -- is this affecting in any way; you are building up your inventories affecting sales in any way?
Mark LaNeve
In terms of the way we are running marketing, sales and service, I am not involved in those discussions. I got plenty to do and we’re trying to sell what we can as many as we can every single month. And the product is flowing incredibly well to us. So, let’s -- I remain incredibly optimistic about the market and we’ve got some really smart people working on those things here.
Erich Merkle
Jasmine, next caller please?
Operator
Yes. That is Jeff Bennett with Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.
Jeff Bennett
Just a little more color if you could, Mark, on Navigator sales. And you had said this is the best August in seven years for Lincoln. Why was Navigator doing so well; was that more production coming out on that vehicle or what was happening there?
Mark LaNeve
What I don’t have at my finger tips is the year-over-year comparison on inventory. I could just tell you that utilities are hot. And on the Ford side and on the Lincoln side we performed incredibly well on utilities, almost across the board. We did redo the Navigator and the Ford Expedition about a year ago, included the EcoBoost engine, a fairly dramatic enhancement to the vehicle, both exterior interior and especially power trainer refinement. And we see very good increases on both vehicles since we took that product action. And utilities are just incredibly in hot segment right now. So, it’s very buoyant; we’ve got good market position and good product. And in actions, I’m looking at the charts, for segments that are under pressure and the cars that perform fairly well too, especially with Fusion. But we continue to be very bullish on Navigator and I’m really looking forward to getting MKX up to full availability or Lincoln dealerships, we think it’s going to be a big winner for us.
Jeff Bennett
And just two more, Mark. I was listening to NPR yesterday and they did a segment about a lot of repo that’s going on in Texas with the falling oil there and the inability for people to pay their leases on their trucks. Are you guys sensing anything in Texas? I know that’s a strong hold for you guys of truck sales may be flattening there or even falling as kind of this oil pricing continues to move around?
Mark LaNeve
Texas lagged the rest of the country earlier in the year but they had a really good July and August, so they’ve come back; they’ve carried their way in terms of the overall contribution to these really good results in July, had a very good August. And some of our really big dealers there posted some huge numbers. And I can tell you that in terms of Ford Motor Credit, repo rates there I think at historic lows. So, there is really nothing that we’ve seen on the horizon. The loss ratios or whatever it’s called that I’ve seen are well below industry averages and I think at historic lows for -- it’s like a positive for Ford Motor Credit. So, we haven’t seen any of that.

And just going into the final months, I’m sure you -- September will blow the last year out of the water because of Labor Day being in there but those final three months, you really don’t see anything that could kind of put us into, I don’t know, hitting the wall or anything like that; you feel that the SAAR will continue to do well going into the back half of the year?
Mark LaNeve
I don’t know what’s going to happen outside of things outside our control but I don’t see anything on the horizon that would indicate any kind of disruption in the business. I mean we’re running in the mid 17s and we seem to see strong demand across our portfolio. I think it’s going to be a competitive market but it has been a competitive market for at least for the seven months I’ve been in the job. So, I’m very, very bullish on the back half of the year. September is a great month for vehicle sales with Labor Day falls in September, the end of the year; December has now become a huge merchandising month. So myself and the team and the dealers are really looking forward to back half of the year. I don’t see anything that would make us be anything but optimistic.

Jasmine, we’re going to take one more caller from the media and we’re going to wrap things up today.

Great. And that last question will come from Nick Bunkley from Automotive News. Please proceed.
Nick Bunkley
Taking a look at the Escape numbers, such hot segment, as you said utilities overall, but the small utilities especially and selling one of the top 10 small CUVs down on the year. Is that all just because of production capacity? And if so, is there anything that you guys can do or planning to do to get your production up more than you’ve had it, so far to get into that -- be able to participate in that segment more?
Mark LaNeve
We’re doing everything possible to squeeze more production. We did run -- let’s see Escape, we ran 37% SVAs or turn rates which is a very high number for Escape. We’re trying to get more availability of the lower series products S and SE but dealer order flow has been fairly rich; they’ve been ordering a fairly rich mix. As I said, in terms of its overall performance, it came within a couple of hundred units of an all time record. The only issue was that all time record was August a year ago. So, it doesn’t give us a great year-over-year comparison. I don’t know whether anybody picked that up or not. But we did 28,870 Escape. That’s a big number. And even though it’s down slightly year-on-year, our overall utility business portfolio that we sell in the showroom, we’re up 12% which I think is going to be a really good number as everything gets pulled through. And we’re continuing to be very bullish on Escape and trying to squeeze more production out, Nick.
Erich Merkle
