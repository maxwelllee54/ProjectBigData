Oscar Snubs Leave Twitter Fans Disappointed
While many in the film industry celebrated their nominations for 85th Academy Awards on Thursday, some Twitter users felt that others had been robbed.
The biggest snub appears to be Ben Affleck's absence from the nominees for Best Director. Many users, including Piers Morgan, felt that Argo made Affleck a worthy contender. Kathryn Bigelow and Quentin Tarentino were also hot topics among missing Best Picture nominees.

Ben Affleck snubbed for Best Director instantly renders this year's Oscars a farce. Well done, Academy. #Aaaaagggghhhgo

Sad Wes Anderson didn't get a nom for the Oscars… Lincolns good, but not THAT good… all rather predictable (obviously!)

Hobbit didn't get a best picture nom or anything like that I think was because of these stupid critics and their feud with 3D technology.

"Hey Josh. It's War. So NO horses from Django or Lincoln got nominated? Makes you wonder what could've been." - War Horse calls his agent

Once again, no women nominated for Best Director. Only 1 woman, Kathryn Bigelow, has ever won. #wmnhist #oscarnoms

Say it ain't so, Quentin Tarantino didn't get nominated for Best Director? Wow, the Academy needs to get their heads examined.

The fact that @loopermovie didn't get a nom for Original Screenplay proves that the Academy doesn't know the definition of "Original"...

You know Ben Affleck invited Kathryn Bigelow to cry and make out on the yacht from the "Jenny From the Block" video.

Really surprised Matthew McConaughey didn't get a Supporting Actor nom for MAGIC MIKE. He owned every scene he was in. #OscarNoms
