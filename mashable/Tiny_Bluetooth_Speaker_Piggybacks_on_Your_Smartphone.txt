Tiny Bluetooth Speaker Piggybacks on Your Smartphone
LAS VEGAS — There's no shortage of Bluetooth speakers at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, but we're quite taken with the tiny-sized Pulse speaker and Rewind earbuds from Felt Audio.

The Pulse speaker ($99) piggybacks onto an iPhone case for easy carrying and can be plucked off and clipped onto something nearby. For example, when driving in a car and wanting to talk hands-free (with good audio), clip the small speaker onto the car visor or seat belt, so chatting is easy without a headset. The Pulse provides Bluetooth capabilities up to 40 feet, so you can use it in an office or at home to blast music too. (We gave it a listen and were impressed with the quality, especially from such a small device).

In addition, the speaker is great for those who use the treadmill — clip it to your sweatpants and attach Felt Audio's earbuds to the device to get rid of earbuds danging from a smartphone (audio will be redirected to the Bluetooth speaker). An accompanying earbud cartridge, with retractable earbuds, can tack on to the speaker, so it takes worrying about your smartphone out of the equation during a workout.

The company said it will be giving away free custom-made iPhone, iPad and iPod touch cases that Rewind earbuds and Pulse speaker to the first 5,000 purchasers, but it hasn't decided how much they will cost in the future.
