The Football Helmet That Could Save Your Kid's Brain
Violent collisions in the NFL are getting more attention from players, journalists and medical professionals — and for good reason. We're just beginning to grasp the effects that repeated big hits can have on the brain, and a troubling series of violent deaths of current and former pros has only raised the stakes for trying to understand how to manage the damage players do to themselves and one another. 
But what about tackle football at the youth level? Surely, slamming into one another over and over can't be good for growing bodies either, right? 
Well, longtime helmet-maker Riddell may have just come up with an innovative solution to track and minimize the damage to young players' brains, according to ESPN.com.

It's called the InSite Impact Response System, and it uses "sensors, data processing units and display monitors" — in the words of Riddell's official trademark filing — to track blows to the head and their impact on young athletes. In other words: fine-tuned tech and big data to provide definitive answers about when a player should be taken out or allowed to continue playing. 
Sensors will be located in the helmet's cushiony interior liner, ESPN reports, and issue wireless alerts to coaches or training staff when a player sustains a hit that exceeds acceptable force measurements. Software will allow young gridiron stars — or, more likely, their coaches and parents — to track accumulated head shots over time, as well. 
The technology is expected to be made available for purchase on Riddell's website this spring. 
Do you think this can help make tackle football safer for young kids — or should they even be allowed to play at all? Give us your take in the comments.
