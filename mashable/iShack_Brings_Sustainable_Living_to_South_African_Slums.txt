iShack Brings Sustainable Living to South African Slums

Researchers at a South African University are putting a modern twist on a way of life for sub-Saharan shack dwellers. 
The iShack, or improved shack, is designed to improve living conditions with solar panels for power and electricity. The prototype shack, located in a settlement outside Stellenbosch, South Africa, stands out from the typical rusty metal and wood dwellings. 
A photovoltaic panel sits on the roof to power three lights, a motion sensitive exterior light and a cellphone charger. The floor is made of bricks from a local landfill, and the back wall is built from clay and hay to regulate temperature. 
In an area with limited resources, the extended roof overhang helps to collect water, and even the windows are strategically placed for improved air circulation. Check out the video, above, for more details. 
More than 60% of Africa's sub-Saharan urban population live in slums. Residents sometimes have to wait years for water or power infrastructure to reach their area.

Each iShack costs around $660, and researchers at the University of Stellenbosch are looking to make it as user and cost-friendly as possible. The project will be tested over the next year thanks to a grant by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with up to 100 shacks built.
