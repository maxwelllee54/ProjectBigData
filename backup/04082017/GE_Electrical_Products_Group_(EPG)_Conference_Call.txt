Jeffrey Immelt - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Unidentified Company Representative
Okay, we’re going to start with GE in just a moment, take your seats please. Okay, let’s get started, anchoring presentation by GE, Jeff Immelt, Chairman and CEO.
Jeffrey Immelt
Great. Good morning, everybody. It’s always great to be in my favorite resort, great to be back here and for another year, so I’m going to dig right in.
I think our view of the world is pretty much what you’ve heard this week’s slow growth volatility; U.S., slightly better; Europe, stable; China, pretty good, kind of what you’ve heard about. We like our business model in this cycle. We think diversity, GE store, cash optionality, big backlog, we think all those things payoff for GE through this cycle, and we’ll continue to deliver in the world that we see today.
We talked about this in the first quarter call. We basically kind of reset oil and gas and basically said, the rest of the portfolio, if you look at aviation, renewables, power, all doing ahead of plan. So we feel good about 2016, the way it’s lined out, again strength of the business model, strength of the portfolio, lots of business is doing well, and just positioned oil and gas, I think appropriate to what we see in the world today.
This is how it looks when you look at segments. This is just kind of, if you will refresh us the outlook meeting in terms of the segments and how we’ll grow, we’ve got five of the segments that are really either add double-digits, high single-digits, big double-digits for the year, so again, lots of the portfolio are very strong.
And just a window on, as we look at the second-half of the year in terms of orders, we see a very strong orders profile in power. We see a very strong orders profile on renewables. We see a very strong orders profile on services. It’s the first time and a long time that the two biggest healthcare markets being the U.S. and China are still in pretty good shape. So we see backlog growing, second-half filling in from an order standpoint, we think that’s positive in terms of gain.
So really when I think about the world today’s slow growth in volatility, you’ve got to like to GE portfolio, you’ve got to like to profile, you’ve got to like to, I’d say the underlying strength of the GE store and the things we’re doing as you think about it.
And then here’s the framework for the year. So no change from what you saw in the first quarter call. So still on track for EPS, free cash flow cash, what we’re going to return to investors, all of these fundamentals are still on track for what we said at the end of the year.
And then the, kind of the way we think about the bridge, so going from 2015 to 2018, so I think two changes. One is, Synchrony happened in 2015 until 2016. So we got some of the benefits from Synchrony in 2015, and appliances was pushed from 2015 into 2016. So we had more naked restructuring in 2015.
Now, the appliance gain is close to – or the incremental gain of the appliances is close to $2 billion, $1.7 billion of the incremental gain that’s all going to be plowed into restructuring. So that makes the fundamental industrial operating strength I’d say makes that even more reinforce as you look at the next few years.
Alstom on track. What we – first of all here is 5% industrial operating profit growth that gets you to $2. And that doesn’t use any of the incremental leverage. So there’s still, at least, $20 billion of incremental leverage on top of what you see here. So really, we still feel really solidly about how we think about the various buckets of buyback, industrial operating profit growth, Alstom performance as we think about the next few years.
So couple of things I think worth updating in EPG, one is, the status of portfolio. The second is, where we’re in digital industrial transformation? The third one is, how to think about industrial operating profit growth over the next few years? And the fourth one is, cash generation and capital allocation. So I’m going to go through each one of those things vis-à-vis in the framework of this bridge over the next couple of years.
Capital is on tracks. So what I say about capital is 80% done. We see good opportunities to continue to sell the efforts we want to sell. The $35 billion looks secure, so what we talked about on April 10th of 2015, still looks a very solid, as we look out over the next few years. So we feel good about the cash generation and cash return to investors.
SIFI de-designation process is underway.When you look at all the reasons why a company would be designated systemic, we no longer meet any of those. So we feel good about where we are in the process and what’s left behind is a very strong industrial finance vertical finance company that’s capable of generating good returns. And so we think GE Capital is on track.
On Alstom, we like – what we see in Alstom so far, I thought I’d first just give you a big picture, strategically this makes you a better company. It gives us in the power space an amazing installed base, where we can bring a tremendous amount of synergies, on the equipment side, bringing the balance of the plant to an already good gas turbine franchise, it’s going to give us a very strong competitive advantage in terms of performance and cost and all the other things that we think about.
It makes us really the world’s biggest renewables player, so broad-based a renewables player and really the right moment in time – at a moment in time when you got the PTC tailwind coming through over the next couple of years, this is going to give us, I think, some really good opportunities, and it strengthens what was at GE a weak grid business and makes us stronger, makes us more competitive for Siemens in AVB.
So strategically, we like what Alstom does for the company. We’re kind of out of the lock room and into the field, as it pertains to synergies. I just – taking you through kind of how I think about through the big buckets of synergies. On the left is services. So this gives you a sense of how we can bring GE services into the Alstom installed base by bringing some of the upgrades and controls into the steam turbine arena.
We have a lot more opportunities in terms of balance of plans, as it pertains to doing service on the rest of the activities that Alstom brings. All the digital tools can be used for the Alstom technology. And it gives us the opportunity to work on other OEMs, as you look at the ability to do service. So it opens up a very broad aperture on services. And then we can use the Alstom capability internally to do more GE – to GE.
So we’re insourcing about an incremental couple billion dollars of technology, that’s going to give us $500 million of margin over the next few years. We will do more HSRGs in one year than Alstom would have done in six or seven or eight years. So the ability to do boiler steam turbines, HSRG. So this has got a ton of margin potential when you think about Alstom in the integration.
Now, this is just a walk of how you get a $0.05 this year to $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018, we’re calling 2017 $0.08 to $0.10, that’s a $1.9 billion of synergies offset by the cost to achieve those $800 million, so that’s the incremental that you see on there. And then the way I think about it from an investor standpoint is probably to do the deal, you have to believe that you could execute on service and that there were no big uglies in the project stack, right, I think that’s out of the way.
I think we know basically we can do those two things. And now to hit the – comfortably be between $0.15 and $0.20, we’ve got to execute on the plant restructuring. We’ve go to be able to do European social plans. We’ve got to insource things, all things we know how to do that are in our control.
And then to get above $0.20, you’ve got to do organic growth. Basically, we underwrote this deal assuming no revenue growth. So basically, if you – you’ve underwritten the base case, you’re executing on a $0.15 to $0.20 case to get $0.20 or above, you’ve got to execute on organic growth, that’s what the teams are working on what they’re looking at right now.
Digital industrial is real. It’s going to add value to shares. We’re beating all of our plans. As we said in 2016, we’ve got a big investor meeting in June that we hope you can attend. So I’m not gong to go through every detail. But I think if you look at, we’ll be at a $7 billion order rate this year. Our productivity is a $0.5 billion. We’ve launched Predix in March. We have 8,000 developers. We’ve go lots of customers that are coming on to Predix. We’ve got more than 100 apps.
So this is moving very aggressively. And again, the way I think about it from an investor standpoint is, more productivity, higher service growth, better linkage from technology, and wherever we go with Predix, you get that for free. And so we are deeply committed to winning in this space.
This is not for casual conversation. This is not a – this is not like doing a PowerPoint chart, you have to do real [indiscernible] to be good at this, okay? And so just kind of just take a walk around the page, there’s a really building blocks you have here, we’ve got an operating platform called Predix. With the starting line we have as many customers as anybody has on Predix.
We have the killer application, right, which is the merger of analytical information with physical information, what we call the digital twin, that is worth a lot, okay, that is massively important. You’ve got to control the edge, so you’ve got to be good at controls. You’ve got to be good at getting, being able to turn inspections into a service using drones and other edge tools, you’ve got to be good at cyber. So industrial or security is absolutely critical.
You’ve got to have what we call Asset Performance Management, you will hear us talk a lot about APM. This is the way to lift analytical data off of your installed base, whether it’s a GE product or somebody else’s product and model it. You’ve got to be good at enterprise, so this is ways to do our productivity for your customers, Movement Planners, and things like that. You’ve got to be good at making your own company, a reference site, what we call it Digital Thread, and you’ve got to go and hire a bunch of new salespeople who know how to sell outcomes and know how to generate good benefits for the customers, we done all these. So we’re very well-positioned to be successful to win here.
It shows up in a numbers. So we got basically every business growing at a rapid pace. When you think about what our revenue is and these show up in service. Predix has launched, look, we’ve got customers in the AG space, the elevator space, the mining space, the transportation space, the trucking space, who are going to be Predix customers. So this is not just inside GE, it’s outside GE, and we’ve got great partners. We’ve got the right telcos. We’ve got other software people. We’ve got big time players like Cisco that are partners. So we’re filling in the gaps of how you think about being additional industrial and we feel very positively about how we’re positioned and where this is going to go.
Now, it’s important, this is something that we’re adding to the GE Store. What I show up here is basically the way we won all of our service businesses from healthcare to transportation, to oil and gas, power, aviation, they’re all going to be on Predix. They’re going to have a suite of tools on how to optimize the maintenance cycle? How to do Asset Performance Management? We’ve got the similar kind of user interface for our field engineers.
This is going to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of productivity each year, and it’s also something that can be translated to people that are Predix customers outside of GE. The service tools are really the easiest way to monetize the industrial Internet is through services. So we’re moving out. We’re moving hard. We’re doing lot of things well, and you’re going to learn lot about this when you go to San Ramon.
So just a little bit on industrial operating performance what we’ve been the last for five years is, we’ve grown 6% on average over the last four or five years, decent organic growth, pretty good margin accretion, had growth in services of about 7%, product is a little bit less. And what we’re thinking about as a baseline for the future is really having 5% operating segment profit growth, right, 5% segment profit growth as a baseline for the company.
And to do that, we think we’ve got to do four things well. We’ve got to increase the growth rate of our service franchise using some of the tools I just went through with you. We’ve got to do great job of launching both H and the LEAP. We have to continue to drive productivity throughout the company and we’ve got to sustain our investment and capability in organic growth. And so, these are really the pillars of how we build our plan really in any economic environment that we see going forward, that’s what it’s important.
So services, we basically have grown service operating profit by about 7% a year. We think looking out in the company, this is going to be more like 9% a year of service operating profit growth. Digital is a big driver of that. We’re going to get both incremental revenue and incremental productivity out of the investments we’ve made in digital. You know, guys, but we’re also are seeing with these new tools, we’re going back after the aged installed base.
So we have really, really high market share on F-turbines. We have relatively lower market share on E-turbines or the CF6, and we’re going right back with these modern tools, right back after the aged installed base, that’s a hit, that is really working in terms of the company.
And then just upgrades, our big piece of how we approach our customers, we’re getting better and better with that. This shows AGPs between 135 and 150, that’s above where we initially frame the year, which I think was at 125. And then we’re basically doubling the amount of upgrades we do in the power business over the next few years in terms of what we’re doing across the product line, I can tell you similar stories about the rest of the company.
So services – incremental increases of service operating profit is what I have been talking about for the last few years in the context of digital industrial, that’s now playing out. H is a great launch, a couple points I make on H. We’re winning in the marketplace. It’s a fast growth segments, and we’re winning in the marketplace, and I expect us to have somewhere between so much further here, further quick, I’ll do it over here.
I expect us to have somewhere between 45% and 50% market share, the H-turbine. The technology is very strong in terms our ability to work and upgrade path. This is going to be tailwind in 2017 operating profit, so we’ll get the launch cost behind us and we see good growth on the H-turbine. And this is a huge installed base, when you about the future of the product, which right here, good feel, you’re awesome, I’m [indiscernible].
So that’s the H. LEAP, a big launch – a big launch of LEAP. We’re going to hold or grow margins over the next few years, as we do LEAP. The technical execution of LEAP has been outstanding so far. We’ve met all the deadlines. We’re making product performance, I think something for investors to keep in mind is this, this is the second in a wave of introduction.
So basically having done the GEnx first is a good preparation for doing the LEAP. We’re going to end up having probably 70% or 75% market share, as we do this launch. So we’re going to manage to grow aviation earnings during this time period, while having a huge launch.
And then I’ll just give you a couple of numbers that, again, I think are – speak well for this page. In 1980, there were 5,000 narrow body aircraft, GE share was zero. By 2020 there will be 18,000, by which more than 13,000 will be GE. So 40 years we went from zero share to 70% share of narrow bodies and somewhere between 40% and 50% haven’t had their first repair cycle yet.
So this is a good news page, about technology, about the future of your GE investor and we’ll manage through that process. Now margins are critical for us to achieve this walk. This shows you kind of the – the top line includes Alstom. So this is our first year of Alstom. The organic margins will continue to grow at least 50 basis points. And then when you look at the total company, including corporate, including Alstom, we expect to get to 16% margins by 2018.
So this is the first four-year of Alstom, as we go through this. And this is a lot about just how we do on product margins and continuing to get structure really out of the company, and I’ve already talked about where service margins are. So the big initiatives are really all about manufacturing product management, simplification and structure.
On the product side, we still see good opportunities to increase our product margins over time. We’re making big, big investments in advanced manufacturing in manufacturing technology, big investments in materials and lean. On the structural side, we’re going to do more in global operations. We’re going to continue to take our SG&A down at least to 12%, and then we’re going to grow revenue while shrinking corporate. So we see a total corporate costs less than $2 billion over time and we’ll continue to make progress on all those. So pretty good story on margins that we have to continue to execute on.
Our long-term goal on organic growth is 5%. We’ll do less than that this year, given the big chunk in the oil and gas business. And some things I would just remind investors are, I’ve already talked about service – increasing the service growth rate, I’ve already talked about LEAP and H, and what they’ll do. We aren’t going to be in a really good cycle in renewables over the next few years from a growth and earnings standpoint.
You’ve got the way the PTC is structured for 2018 and really opens up, so it’s not only a U.S. story, it’s a global story. You got healthcare with the two biggest markets kind of off their back with some reasonable opportunities in the area of Alstom. We’re going to try to grow the Alstom businesses at the same organic growth rate, as you go through and want to try that forward in the future.
We’re continuing to invest in new products that can fill gaps like advanced turboprop in the aviation space, additional healthcare products and life sciences, mainly organically, really guys the way we think about the company is really as an organic first company in terms of the way we want to drive growth. We basically – our call on oil and gas is more or less what you hear from the rest the industry, where the onshore stuff probably gets better towards the end of this year and the industry stabilizes in 2017. So we’re not really counting on much new in the oil and gas space.
So, we add all those things up. We still – we still want to keep the company moving forward from an organic growth standpoint, and we’re still investing in new technologies and new ideas that are going to continue to drive this. So less than our 5% goal this year, but this is what we want to drive in the company over the long-term.
Globalization is still a key part to grow. Just like on the product side, where we have a good portfolio of different industries that we’re in, we also have a great portfolio of geographies that we can play in. Alstom really adds to our global footprint almost all of the Alstom revenue is outside the United States, so it allows us to strengthen our global footprint, as you look forward.
So this has been a – let’s say a 7% grower over time. It will probably be less than that this year with some of the big challenges in the resource-rich countries. But there’s still lot of business out there in power generation. We see it in place like Indonesia, Argentina, places like that. We see good – let’s say success of the digital capabilities in the airline industries around the world.
So there’s still geographies the work, and there’s an opportunity. We brought some people over from GE Capital to help us in the capital market side to arrange financing and the power side, but even in some other industries that we’re in. And there they do a great job of bringing the ECA financing and other financing into play.
So we like our global capability and global footprint. And we’re going to have a huge rail deal in India that’s going to position us very well for the future in India, and Europe, I think remains an opportunity particularly with the Alstom footprint. We have a strong capability in Europe. We have significantly lower shares in Europe than we have in the United States, and we see ways to further monetize our position with Alstom going forward.
From a cash standpoint, we remain committed to the 95% goal. The big opportunities that we have inside the company, first and foremost to get Alstom up to the kind of a free cash flow return that we would expect. I think that’s going to be a pretty straightforward process and then all of the synergies really turn into cash, and there’s just not going to have to be a lot of incremental capital expenditures if you look at Alstom.
We’ve got plenty of facilities. We’ve got plenty of technology, this is really about execution. So I don’t see a tremendous cash needs vis-à-vis Alstom. We want to go CFO way in line with earnings. It’s not a huge jump, I think we can do better here. But we have the opportunity to do a little bit better in receivables and payables across all the buckets of working capital. Incremental improvements go a long way and this is how the team is being compensated.
And so we see good opportunities on the working capital side. There’s less of a P&E expenditure for the company, as we go forward vis-à-vis the big H launch, the big aviation launches, those kind of tail off when you think about the future. So we see better performance in working capital, getting Alstom back up consistent with what we would expect in GE, more capital efficiency in terms of new product launches. Those are going to be the keys to get us to 95% cash return. And we think that’s an important goal for the team from a metric standpoint and from an overall the way that we payout target.
So that’s deeply embedded in the LTIP and the AEIP as we look forward into the future of the company. This is kind of the way we think about capital allocation. So there are a couple of numbers that I would have you think about is, if there’s – $145 billion is kind of what we talked about consistently at the outlook meeting in terms of cash generation. There’s about $20 billion – $20 billion plus we think in incremental leverage. And this helps support the reinvestment in organic growth.
So we include P&E, R&D. We include pension, funding in that bucket. It includes the dividend yield between Synchrony and the $35 billion of the GE Capital exit, that’s $55 million that we said, we’re going to return back to investors to buy back and disciplined capital allocation in terms of M&A – incremental M&A or incremental buyback.
Now, with that $145 billion and $20 billion, there’s – what I would say there’s $30 billion that’s unassigned. This is the $20 billion of incremental leverage and $10 billion of just free cash flow inside the company, that’s not going into those bucket. So you’ve got $30 billion unassigned on top of the $2 in 2018.
So that’s just an important way to think about how we think about running the company and where we’re positioned right now. And then from an M&A standpoint, our targets are really backward integration. So you saw we bought Doosan’s HSRG business that gives us capacity.
We’ve won, let’s say the entitlement, it gives us a really a very easy investment to return on filling some technical gaps, doing small deals to fill technical gaps, and it gives us an opportunity to do bolt-ons at good returns, at least, 15% of returns. But fundamentally, we’re an organic growth story, and that’s how we’ll continue. We’re not going to look past attractive deals, if they’re out there, but the underlying assessment we’re making is organic growth.
So you’ve got $30 billion on top of the $2 in 2018 that’s the way to think about the company. Here is how the team gets paid. So annually we have, what’s called an AEIP and the goals are split between financial goals and strategic goals. The financial goals tend to be three or four in each business. They are, EPS in the case of the entire company, inside the businesses it’s operating profit, margins, free cash flow. And then each business has a metric, for instance, our Aviation business is going to have a gross margin financial metric that ties to the LEAP launch.
So you’re going to have thousand people in aviation who all feel like they get paid based on how well we launch a new engine, that’s motivational, let’s say. And then there’s a bunch of strategic goals – five or seven strategic goals in each business that tie with where they are in the cycle, what they have to do. And then the LTIP goes from 2016 to 2018, and this is things like cumulative EPS, it’s industrial margin, it’s industrial ROTC, and it’s a combination of both cash generated and cash return.
So I think from an investor standpoint when you look at this page, you see the right balance between reinvesting for the future, operational growth, and that’s kind of what we’re trying to achieve when you think about the company. So just to end the way I stated, here is the bridge 2015, 2016 for the future. Synchrony happened faster. Appliances, I mean, I think with the increment gain we get from appliances guys, you can do a lot of damage with that amount of money. It’s a substantial difference when you think about where we’re going. How we do the walk, as you go forward, and then incremental leverage.
So, I think, for you in this room, you’re going to see, I think very strong EPS growth. You’re going to see a lot of cash optionality. You’re going to see sustainable competitive advantage to the GE store, and you’re going to see execution of digital industrial in terms of value that they can create over the long-term.
So that’s a presentation. It’s a tradition to call on cliff first. So I just – I hate to be – since you guys keep coming here, I get to keep calling on cliff. Until you guys go to a new location, I get to keep calling on cliff, okay? So I’m saying Boston – listen, if you want to come to Boston next year, we’ll put on a good show for you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
I have already offered to take you to the best restaurant in Boston, which I’m not going to define until we get closer. What gives you the confidence of the second-half turn in parts of energy and the 2017 turn in the other parts. What are the data points that you are looking at that we should track?
Jeffrey Immelt
So, again, I think we have a very – if you look at energy cliff, you’ve got a very solid process for how you book orders. So we see commitments. We see pipeline. We see big deals underway. So on the frame side, you get a pretty good window on what the bolus of orders that going to be coming through the system. On a renewable side, it’s really, guys, this is kind of regulatorily driven. You’ve got a very standard way that the PTC has been written, you’re going to – industry is going to have a good couple years on that.
I think in healthcare is just a different case, right. If you go to China in healthcare, in U.S. in healthcare, you’re on a completely different cadence in terms of interest in the industry than you saw the last couple of years. And then oil and gas, I don’t want to be the prognosticator on oil and gas.
I would say whatever the industry is seeing that’s kind of comparable to what we’re seeing. People are more confident at $48 and they were at $28. But I think it’s just – we’re expecting the industry to stabilize before it grows. So we’re going to have to go through a stabilization process that probably starts next year and some like that.
[Multiple Speakers]
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks, I appreciate that. One last presentation right before that, I just stay in oil and gas if we could and we got the message on the organic growth focus for the company, we played back in December, you said you would stay interested potentially in oil and gas acquisitions, you would say disciplined, Baker Hughes/Halliburton seems to have come and gone, and the near inference is you stayed disciplined there too…
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
We notice Jeff Bornstein sent a couple of smoke signals up recently about interest in oil and gas acquisitions potentially, just give us an update on your on your appetite.
Jeffrey Immelt
So we’re in the industry cycle, it’s better to do acquisitions at the low point of the cycle than high point of the cycle, right. So I think we’re always interested. There is very specific things we’re looking at and I just don’t think – I think for anybody in the space. We’re going to do things that make sense assuming oil prices don’t increase. I think that’s – that’s been a hard and fast rule we’ve had to say we’re going to get the upside if they go forward, if not we’re not going to pay for it, so that’s the thing.
And then the last thing, I’d say is, look, acquiring and doing the job you want us to do on Alstom, that’s a lot of work, that’s lot of – even for the company as big as we are. And we put a tremendous amount of time and efforts on getting Alstom, right and that’s been job one. Now that’s we’re feeling better about that right now. So it will make sense, but that’s not – I don’t feel like we needed to anything dramatic in oil and gas.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, just a question on buybacks. Do you have any opportunity to accelerate the buyback even where the stock price is right now and given that you’re still going through the SIFI process that the government gives you any flexibility to tab into your balance sheet earlier?
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes. Look I think the government on buyback, so just kind of what do we think the right time and right return is and Jeff Bornstein, his judgment.
Unidentified Analyst
So you could accelerate buyback?
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes, until we get out of SIFI, you take the capital commitments down in terms of GE Capital that opens up a big gateway. But there is opportunity for us. I just for sure. Yes, Scott?
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks Jeff. How do we – how should we think about the appliances restructuring tailwind and is not in earnings ramp and your earnings ramp really didn’t change after you got that tailwind. Is just to support a more, a little cautiousness that oil and gas
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes, I think we’re just underwriting – trying to underwrite a base case – we think the incremental restructuring, really firms up – helps us underwrite, helps us to take risk reduce, all of the activities that we have to do the walk we need to do. But it’s – we would do more restructuring this year than any year in the history of the company. And so in some ways I think – that’s just something want to start remaining people off, because our track record being able to execute on that is good and we see lots of good projects. They’re going to payback here.
Unidentified Analyst
So not put you on the spot, but I will I mean you won’t put the line in the no way your industrial go down next year?
Jeffrey Immelt
In 2017, look I’d be really horribly disappointed, horribly disappointed and people wouldn’t make – people would be horribly disappointed. Their compensate would show it. Bornstein couldn’t afford the big news spreading behind – if we do that, I mean look I don’t this- this is the LEAP is a big launch. But you have to real launch, but you have really – as good as technical, manufacturing, engineering team as we – as I’ve ever seen are going to be working on this. We’ve got all of the background of the GEnx. I can’t describe to you how important that is as you go through these launches. So I think, Scott, it’s I just – that’s not how we think about ourselves okay. Jeffrey?
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks, Jeff. I just want to make sure on the bridge that we get kind of year one of the three years nailed down. So if I think about kind of targeting 5% OP growth, I believe you think you can do that ex-Alstom. So if I’m starting with $18 billion, I got 5%, I got a little Alstom love some restructuring tailwind. It does seem like you should be comfortably over $19 billion in segment OP, which I think you were comfortable with earlier this year. Are you still comfortable with that number or…
Jeffrey Immelt
For 2016 or…
Unidentified Analyst
For 2016, the segment level OP?
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes, Jeff, I don’t see really any change in 2016. And then if I, again, we’re not ready to give 2017 guidance and things like yet. But I would consider to be a relatively normal walk year-by-year. I don’t see this as an 18 hockey stick. I see it as a relatively normal walk year-by-year.
Unidentified Analyst
And then just…
Jeffrey Immelt
Does that okay…
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, that’s very helpful, because it was a little unclear on the last call if you really felt good about that.
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
On cash flow, I mean, I do see a footnoted free cash flow is going to exclude pension. But I think you’re looking at multiple years of pension. I think you’ve only disclosed 2017, but should we expect that kind of $2 billion a year for a few years after 2017?
Jeffrey Immelt
Jeff, I don’t exactly know. I think 2017 and 2018, it’s going to be in that range. And then the point I make is, that’s in the 145. As we consider that part of the baseline and anything above that in terms of leverage or other incremental cash that we use for M&A and things like that, we don’t need that for the pension the way we see it. So I think that’s the way I would think about it. I know Jeff really – is that?
Unidentified Analyst
[Audio Inaudible]
Jeffrey Immelt
No, but it’s in the base plan, it’s not ex-plan. Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
And Jeff so service profit growth going from 7% to 9%, how do you get there? So, I mean, obviously you’re going to go after your power installed base, but how much of it is healthcare improving? How much of it is that you got to capture some oil and gas service, transportation, as you know, is that going the wrong way. So in this environment can you get to 9%, or do you need a pickup in the…?
Jeffrey Immelt
I think you’re going to get a little bit more an organic growth and you got a tremendous amount of, let’s say, tailwind on margins on – to look at that number. So, again, I don’t think we – we don’t have to count on oil and gas getting better to do that. I think, guys, you got to keep in mind, you’ve got – we basically have won most of the big installed base battles. You basically now for three or four or five years have invested in incremental services around digitization that adds to growth and margins.
We can now – I was at a research center on Monday, we can basically characterize a jet engine fleet engine by engine and model the optimal repair, link that to the way that we’re doing service repairs. And then, look, I think all of this has given us confidence to go back after CF6, E-turbines, we’ve been doing that now for two years. We see the benefits that come with that. Alstom quite honestly helps us a lot on that. So you’ve got four levers that you’re pulling to help us get to that with a big – with a huge backlog that’s profitable.
Unidentified Analyst
So you think you can do that, if we have this kind of lethargic global growth?
Jeffrey Immelt
Look, everything that we talked about today basically says, we live in a slow growth and volatile world. Segments go in and out of favor. Oil and gas is in a very tough cycle right now. We think it stabilizes, but we’re not waiting for $120 oil and make our plan, yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, Jeff, in terms of this point of being out of the locker room on to the field for Alstom and no big uglies, it was a pretty ugly skid kind of into the close there. What you’re seeing now, I mean, has kind of the base business there stabilized, and just now that you’ve actually seen it?
Jeffrey Immelt
I think Shannon you see two things. I think you see two things. One is, there’s nothing about the execution that’s a surprise, right? And the second thing is, people will buy the products we acquired from Alstom in the market. So, again, when you do a deal like your Alstom, you value the steam turbine equipment business at zero.
It’s actually worth something. We will have customers. We will sell things. We weren’t exactly sure before we did the acquisition, if you could do the bottoming cycle with their technology, build the balance of plant, does that add up to a 61% H turbine or 63% right.
So we’ve seen now the technologies snapping other. We see all kinds of benefits from a service standpoint that’s coming there. So look they were in play for 18 months. You’re point that’s get into a landing as accrued. And I think – I think we’ve been able to bold this year quickly with some value creating opportunities.
The whole trigger guys, is again we still have to execute things like that But when I look at the 15 to 20 which should be able to do this. There is the right now working on it. We shouldn’t be able to do this. The whole kind of think that takes us from being a good deal and makes it a great deal is can you do something interesting on the revenue side, that to me, you guys get that for free, in we can execute on that.
Unidentified Analyst
In some of the incremental appliance gain, go towards that?
Jeffrey Immelt
Some well, yes, but lot of it’s going to go. We got a lot of projects that can go to – look, if we have the chance to full forward, something 17 integration ideas on the 16, we’re going to do that.
Unidentified Analyst
Making – try to make 2017…
Jeffrey Immelt
So how much of the digital industrial would you say is baked into the $2 plus outlook. So it would be just look at that and what upside to the – I would say the interest is not zero couple sense for sure. Mainly in things you can eat. So basically what I would say is service revenue, service productivity, incremental industrial productivity helps us get to the $2.
Not, but enough because when investing, we want to see that return. All the Predix is upside to that, so fundamentally the way we’ve tried to do this is take investors step by step is take investor step-by-step, right. It’s new idea. What can industrial – what can industrial company do here?
So I think everybody in this room those had a value productivity service growth. I think nobody says, okay, if you now can do Predix on all the ag companies, on drug companies, people like that. So none of that’s been valued into how I think about 2018.
But we’re trying in other words I’d say we’re in a good position as anybody at the beginning, which – look, you’ve been hearing this stuff all week. I have the advantage of going last, some of it is BS. This is real, okay. This is since I’m here and I’m last I’m going to use this opportunity to say we are doing real things with real people and you’re going to get a chance to see that in June.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you just tell us who – which do you think us most be yes in last…?
Jeffrey Immelt
I would never share that with you.
Unidentified Analyst
I’m fine, I don’t need it. Thank you very much. But looking back over the last three years, you spend basically $5 billion on restructuring. You’ve had some nice services growth that’s been accretive a little bit value gap, top line has been okay. Profits have not grown anywhere close to that $5 billion.
Your CIO presented last week and made some really – it was good insight into what they’re doing there, the hiring people in San Ramon. There is a lot of reinvestment and Alstom, repositioning sort of restructuring. Is there a percentage of that restructuring that we could think about as more repositioning than actual to the bottom line?
Jeffrey Immelt
There is always a piece of it – that’s a piece of repositioning that goes on that, a lot of this called restructuring and again SG&A way down, incremental margins up through product launches and things like that. So I think you can run to ground the entire investment. But there’s always a piece that’s repositioning.
Unidentified Analyst
So is it like half-and-half or how do we think that?
Jeffrey Immelt
Not closer to that.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. It’s a lot more…?
Jeffrey Immelt
Yes, lot of pure restructuring.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, and then just thinking about the $19 billion plus this year, how fourth- quarter loaded is that – you guys have come every year it seems like more and more fourth quarter. How much should we think about when it comes from a seasonality perspective?
Jeffrey Immelt
See I don’t have a quarterly split, it’s definitely second-half and again a lot of it is really very careful in another words is – it’s the gas turbine shipments are lined up much more in the second-half the Hs and things like that. So it’s not like unexpected stuff, it’s more kind of in backlog execution, but it’s certainly second-half.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then one last question just on free cash flow. How do you judge the guys internally when it comes to accounts receivable. There is a decent amount that you guys used the strategy of selling to GE Capital. How do you judge the industrial guys? [Multiple Speakers]
Jeffrey Immelt
So the segments pay for that. In other words, the segments get charged for that. I think we viewed it more as a competitive advantage.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes.
Jeffrey Immelt
Risk reduction. It’s economic. So – but the segment guys have to make a trade-off and they get penalized, let’s say, they get – they have to pay for it okay?
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Jeffrey Immelt
Is that okay? Okay, good. Thanks. Another year I want boutique and my dream comes true.
