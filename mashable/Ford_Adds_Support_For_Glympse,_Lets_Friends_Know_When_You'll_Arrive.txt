Ford Adds Support For Glympse, Lets Friends Know When You'll Arrive
LAS VEGAS — Real-time location-sharing app Glympse announced plans Monday to bring its app into Ford vehicles.
The first location-sharing app for Ford's SYNC in-car connectivity system, Ford drivers will now be able use voice commands to let friends, family, and colleagues know exactly where they are while driving.
"People typically share their location while in the car, and by integrating Glympse into Ford SYNC AppLink, we're providing drivers with a rich, real-time and hands-free way to share where they are," said Bryan Trussel, co-founder and CEO of Glympse. 
To use Glympse, drivers will download the app onto their iPhones or Android devices, and then Bluetooth-pair or USB-connect that phone to a Ford SYNC AppLink-enabled vehicle.
Once connected, a driver can press the SYNC voice button on the steering wheel of the car and say "Send Glympse" while theyâ€™re on the road and share their location. Voice commands guide drivers through the location-sharing process, and send the car's exact location to a contact in their phones. Location details can also be posted on Facebook and Twitter.
The recipient of your Glympse can monitor where your vehicle is in real time on a map on a smartphone or the web. So, you can know exactly when your teenager will be home from a party, or keep track of your business partner whoâ€™s stuck in traffic on the way to a big meeting.

A timer limits how long your location is visible.  This lets you choose to share your location with your colleague for an hour while you're on your way to a meeting, but not continue sharing your location once the meeting is over and you're headed home.
"Glympse is a great example of how smartphone app integration with the car can help us make the driving experience more convenient for our customers, thus adding perceived value to their vehicle," said Julius Marchwicki, Ford SYNC AppLink program manager. 
Glympse recently partnered with Mercedes-Benz to integrate the app into the new Mercedes-Benz Digital DriveStyle application
If you don't have a qualifying vehicle, you can still take advantage of Glympse, just in a different way. The app is available for Android, iPhone, Windows Phone and BlackBerry, and lets you share your location in real time — just without the integrated voice functionality available with the Ford Sync.
Not just for driving, the app can be used any time you need to track another person's location. For instance, a runner might use the app to share his location with a family member in case something happens while he's out training for a marathon.
