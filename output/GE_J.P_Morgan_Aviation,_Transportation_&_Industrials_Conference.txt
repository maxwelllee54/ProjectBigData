Steve Tusa
Great. Very pleased. I think this is the last of the day for me and the last of the conference, so saving the best for last. We are very pleased to have John Rice who runs Global Growth for GE.
John Rice
Great. Thanks, Steve [ph]. I’m happy to be with you, guys, on this cold and snowy day. It doesn’t snow much in Hong Kong which is where I came in from. So it’s good to see a little bit of the white stuff. And it makes me happy to come and happy to leave.
So let me talk a little bit -- I’ll set the stage for what’s going on. And a lot of the stuff on this chart is not new news to you but I’ll try to draw it out in a GE context. Overall, demand for infrastructure continue to be very strong. You’ve got a growing middle class. You’ve got a huge pipeline of opportunities. But as we work our way through this, you’ll see the world is a little more complicated. There are some challenges. And not every order is going flow through at the same pace that we would have thought it might have a year ago, for example.
Customers need better solutions. And the way we internalize this is we live in a cost per unit world. So it’s cost per ton if you’re in the mining business. It’s cost per barrel or cost per MMBTU if you’re in the oil and gas business. Cost per seat mile or ton mile if you’re in the aviation or the transportation business, which is to say that there’s a lot of opportunities out there.
But you have to be able to articulate your solution in a way that shows how that cost per unit is going to come down. You see the oil and gas companies changing their plans for CapEx this year, that doesn’t mean that they’re not still spending a lot of money. They’re spending less than they were but they’re going to spend it on stuff that delivers real productivity solutions and lowers their cost per unit of extraction. And that’s where we think we can add value.
The dollar, the euro, the RMB, people think about the global currencies in the world, but really, we live in a world where jobs are the global currency. Creating jobs, the ability to invest and do smart things locally and create a global supply chain around that that allows you to deliver better answers to your customers is what this is all about. And I’ll talk a little bit more about that later.
And still, believe it or not, there are lots of capital -- there’s lots of capital and pools of capital that are looking for infrastructure investment opportunities. But the path to get from the capital to the opportunity is more complicated and we have to fill some of that void. So we’ve had to create some capabilities there that, frankly, 5 or 10 years ago we just didn’t worry about.
From an environmental perspective, geopolitical uncertainty, think about the things that we worry about today -- Russia and the Ukraine, ISIS -- that weren’t really on our radar screen at the beginning of last year, that’s going to continue governance. And the activism that goes with that are going to count more than ever. So we have to think -- when we think about 170 countries and what we do and where we do it, we have to be paying attention to what’s on the government’s agenda.
And when we do that and when we do it well, we get more business out of it. This term that has been floating around, economic nationalism, right, in a tougher time, in a tougher economic period, especially in countries with high unemployment, you’d tend to see them kind of circle the wagons and do things which are good for the home team but not necessarily good, certainly if you’re hanging around the EU, you see this all the time. That’s part of the world that we live in and we have to figure out how to make ends meet in that environment.
Project development capacity, people with the skill set to see the white space, to bring a commercial offering and technology and the financial wherewithal is becoming more and more important. Decision-making processes are complicated and I don’t need to tell you about oil price and currency volatility. In that context, we still see a lot of growth opportunities. So if you look at our orders outside the U.S., since 2010 had been up an average of 10% annually, 62% of our orders are outside the U.S. now. If you look at our backlog, you see an even greater growth rate. And over 50% of our backlog are in what we call the growth or developing economies. So lots of numbers. I’ll give you a little more flavor on that in a minute.
We think there are some basic imperatives which weed [ph] the place that we have to run to have this continue. We talked a little bit at the end of the year about the GE Store. I’ll spend some more time on that. The long-term commitment that we’re making to these growth markets, you just don’t show up and leave or when the sun stops shining and it starts to rain, so you got to be present even when the times are tough.
How you localize and optimize around local capabilities that marry with your global strengths. Some big growth themes, there are lots of these. I’ll touch on three. How we expand to new markets and this point about partnerships and building financing solutions that work for our customers.
This is the GE Store that we talked about in December. We’re going to talk about it again in the annual report. It’s so important for us to leverage the horizontal to go along with the vertical in our business. And this is kind of where it all comes together.
These are the skill sets that we have to have that play across each of our businesses. And we have to figure out how to bring them to bear in the right way in 170 countries. There was a few more than 170 last year. Technology, I think that’s pretty clear. And some of you are going to join us next week in our Global Research Center. You’re going to get a real dose for how we do this and how we take a transformational step in material sciences and make sure that it goes from aviation to power and water to oil and gas in a way that creates real leverage.
The service is dynamic and I think services and the Industrial Internet go hand in hand. If you think about the GE, 130 years ago, started largely with equipment. Equipment was what we did for most of the first 90 or 100 years. In the last 25 years, we’ve built these massive service businesses and now you have the Industrial Internet and software and digital technologies. That’s the third leg of the GE Store.
So this is where we balance the horizontal and the vertical. And our ability to optimize this, we think, creates better solutions for our customers and better returns for our shareholders. I’ll touch on each of the categories in a minute.
But the growth market acceleration, so leveraging the store -- our scale, expanding beyond the core, Power Conversion. So we acquired this business a few years ago. It had no presence in Latin America. Today, we book $600 million worth of orders in the Latin American oil and gas space because we have people in Latin America that have coverage and have the capability to go in and work with our customers down there. So we went from $0 to $600 million just because we had global scale that we could leverage.
If you look at the key geographies and you look at that big background number I showed you before, we got Middle East with $55 billion of the backlog, the ASEAN region with $19 billion and China with $18 billion. So what we’ve been able to do over the last few years is build these big sets of backlogs that will give us the opportunity now to leverage our service capabilities and do the kinds of things in these markets that you’ve seen us do over decades in developed countries.
This is how we think about China. China has gone through several phases and in our evolution there, in the ‘80s, we were buying inexpensive stuff. Then we started selling and we started making, then we started partnering. Now, to be relevant, to stay relevant in China, we have to think about clean energy.
Now there’s probably some skeptics out there that think that the Chinese aren’t interested in the environment and don’t really want to clean things up, I can tell you, that’s not true. They have a growing middle class that really cares about the quality of air in Beijing. And their eyes and throats hurt just like yours do when you travel there. And they’re going to get that fixed and we have to be on the team that helps them fix it. So clean energy is going to be a big deal. They’re going to be massive in the energy space.
Just 2,800 gigawatts by 2020, number one in the world, it’s going to be a lot of gas. It’s still going to be more coal. It will be some nuclear. It will be some wind. It’s going to be all of the above. But it’s going to be cleaner.
Affordable healthcare is another area that’s very important to them and we have a role to play. We need to do things in China and do things in China for the rest of the world. So this is how we’re thinking about phase 2 or phase 3, really, of our work in China and how we ensure that we’re always relevant in what will soon be the world’s largest market.
Localization capability. So we have to do this in many places and we have to do it in a smart way. We can’t localize everything everywhere. Every airline that buys a jet engine from us would like us to have a service shop in that country, we can’t do that. We have to be smart about the areas where we pick to do it and who we pick to do it with.
Emergency power, our global locomotive space, the opportunity that we have not just with what we do in the United States with the class ones but the partnerships that we have in places like Kazakhstan and South Africa that give us the opportunity to take high value kits that can be produced in the United States and assembling them around the world and penetrate markets that we wouldn’t have a chance to penetrate if we didn’t do that. I’ll spend a little bit more time in a minute on value healthcare.
And Africa oil and gas. Even with oil at $50 or $60 a barrel, there are going to be huge opportunities in Africa. They’re going to play out over a longer period of time. Some of the orders that we thought we might have booked in 2015 will slide to 2016. We don’t see much getting canceled but if you just look at our subsea business, which is active in a number of African countries, there’s probably between $5 billion and $7 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that will play out over the next period of time.
Last year, we would have said, well, a bunch of that stuff might hit in 2016. It’s going to get delayed a little bit. It’s going to get another review. It’s not going to happen as quickly as we thought it was. But it’s still going to happen, we think.
How we complement this effort is with our footprint, right? So we have to have lower cost and we have to localize to do it. We opened up a multimodal facility a couple of weeks ago with Prime Minister Modi in Pune. That’s a facility that houses four different GE businesses. It’s the first of its kind that we’ve done from a greenfield where we’ve said from the beginning, okay, this is going to be the home for a number of different GE businesses.
We’ve got tremendous synergies when we do that. We can introduce into India advanced manufacturing. So we’ve got additive manufacturing capability there. And the work that we do in India plugs right into our center of excellence that we launched in Pittsburgh last year.
Engineering centers, Poland and Teatro [ph] Mexico are two examples of where we have great groups of people that feed into this global innovation framework and shared services. And I’ve got a slide on that in a minute.
This has been a big contributor to the SG&A reduction. You’ve seen us go from 17.5% SG&A to 14% at the end of the last year. We’ve got our eyes set on 12% by the end of 2016. This is part of the way that we’re getting to those improvements.
We’ll have 8,000 in these locations by 2017. Today, we have about 5,000. We’re assimilating work from 500 different locations and going to concentrate the bulk of it or about 60% of it in five places, 400 ERPs to 40.
I get a question a lot about how you ended up with 400 ERPs. It’s not something that happened by design. We acquired a few businesses in the last 10 or 15 years and this is now an opportunity to clean them all up. So this is a good thing. And you’ve got to clean your closet out every once in a while. And this a good example of the benefits that come from that.
And segment processes. So this is not a financial exercise, right? This isn’t just accounts payable and payroll and stuff like that. We’re going to do legal work this way. We’re going to do human resource work this way. We’re going to look at all of our enabling functions and see opportunities that come out of this.
So I think this is going to be not just significant in terms of SG&A reduction, but a fundamental change in the way we run GE.
I’ll touch on three growth themes quickly. The first is marine. This is a very exciting space for us. It’s a couple of billion dollars in revenue for us today. We think that can easily double as we concentrate more on our capabilities in this space.
And you look on the lower left-hand side, and just take a look at the drill ships, the floating platforms, LNG [ph] and the GE content that goes on those, this is energy and oil and gas and power conversion of unit of energy management. So we have lots of opportunities to grow. There isn’t one ship builder that I would say we have the market share with that we ought to have. It’s been fragmented. We’ve focused on it by the separate businesses. We haven’t gone in as one GE. We’ve just appointed a big GE leader and officer to run this play. And we have we think a lot of growth opportunities and a lot of share gain opportunities in this space.
So it’s got to be around power generation and propulsion and the positioning work that has to take place to keep these ships in the right place. And the ability to predict, so the industrial Internet also has a huge, huge play for us.
Value, healthcare and wind. Value and healthcare business, the lower cost healthcare technologies that provide access for people who don’t have it today. And lots of parts of the world is a huge opportunity for growth. You can see it’s about $1 billion for us last year. We see double digit growth opportunities. And we’ve been spending a lot of our NPI or research and development work in the last few years focusing on cost and access. And it’s very much a global effort.
If you look at the Vscan example on the lower left, this was really -- it’s manufactured in China. This is a handheld ultrasound. Okay, so now a doctor or a midwife that’s working with a pregnant woman anywhere in the world can replace the stethoscope and thermometer with something that’s a little more sophisticated. And when you do that, you reduce deaths.
We donated a piece of equipment to a charity in Cambodia. And they had over a year, 785 births with no deaths, mother or child, in a country that would experience about 5% mortality among a population of that size.
So this stuff really works. And it’s a calling card for us. If you think about the countries that we operate in, when you can talk about basic forms of healthcare and distributed power, you are welcome everywhere. And then you add to that more sophisticated technology as time goes on and you’ve got a real opportunity to play.
In the wind business, some of you historians will remember the business we bought out Enron’s bankruptcy for over 13 years ago, it was about $300 million in revenue. It operated in four or five countries. Today, we have wind turbines operating in 30 countries. We’ve got 11 countries where we sell more than $100 million annually. Very much a global business.
A lot of our growth this year will come from places like the Middle East or Asia. It’s very global. And it’s got high growth potential. And as we continue to -- and it also requires great localization strategies. With 50-meter wind turbine blades, you can’t ship them around long distances. So you have to develop local manufacturing capacity. Whether we do that or we have, in this case, our suppliers do it, it doesn’t really matter.
Presence in new markets. One of the stories with how you globalize. You have to go places that, frankly, when I was starting out in GE a number of decades ago I never thought I would be in these places.
In the right-hand side is the next generation of new markets. Five of these ten countries I’ve been to. And I’ve got several on the list for this year. I never thought I would be going to Papua New Guinea. In fact, before last year, I probably couldn’t have found it on a map. And we’ll do $100 million there this year. We’ve got a small team in place. They have natural resources. They need power generation. They need oil and gas processing equipment. It’s another country that’s going to be in our sweet spot. And after this list of ten, we’ll have another list of ten.
One of the things that goes with localization is the ability to separate yourself from the competition when it comes to local content. So if you think about the ‘80s and the ‘90s, it was about offset agreements. Now, more and more the discussion is about local content. So if we sell $100 million worth of stuff in this space, we have to localize 30% or 40% or 50%. But it’s a math exercise in a lot of countries.
Our job is to make sure that it’s not really a math exercise because our argument is there’s a lot more value to a GE job than there might be to somebody else’s job. And we make that argument because we know how we train people, we know how we develop leaders, we know how we innovate and we plug the people who innovate for us into a global innovation framework, so very little, nothing really of substance that we introduce into our markets is born from the work that’s found in just one country. We collaborate for everything we do, four or five different countries work together to create the Vscan that happen to be manufactured in China, but you took smart people in a lot of different places to do that. That’s an advantage if we localize in your country.
The supplier ecosystem in small and medium size business development work that we do, we hold our suppliers to a global standard because what we sell has to measure up globally. So for every one GE job, you’re going to have six or seven supply chain jobs that are created as a result of that. And they’re all going to be trained to our standard because when we sell equipment from that facility the Pune facilities that we inaugurated last month, 50% of what we do there gets exported out of India. And there’s no customer that we sell to in anywhere in the world that wants anything less than our best standard. So we have to set a level and maintain that.
And then ethical and transparent business practices. So when you add it all up, our argument is the value of a GE job is worth more than the value of a job that one of our competitors might create. And we think we can make the case for that.
So how we win globally is balancing this global and local effort. We got to leverage our strengths globally. We have to simplify, we have to rethink how we make decisions and who makes them and where they’re made. We have to optimize the backroom so that we can put more resources and content into the front room.
And when you think about the GE Store of global footprints, the way we’re thinking about the Industrial Internet, we think that we’re shaping things that will play out certainly over the next year and the next three years and the next five years, but also over the next three, four or five decades. That the best global companies in the world are going to be the companies that not only work on this stuff but get it right.
So thanks for listening and, Steve, it’s over to you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q -Steve Tusa
Thanks. Just the first question. The global growth organization started recently, I think ’09, ’10 type of timeframe. I believe the publicly disclosed funding there was around $300 million of expense that kind of teetered the organization. What’s the run rate now of what GE spends on GGO? And maybe just talk about how the investments work their way in and out. What exactly does that fund? What’s characterized as a part of GGO versus kind of being in the businesses?
John Rice
So the level in the beginning was -- if you look at the old GE international organization, it was about that. Then we grew from there and now we’ve cut back to a level -- as we’ve focused on reducing our corporate expense and all the things that guys have heard about, we’ve cut it back to where it’s in the $400 million range. And we spend a little of that on programs. So we will do project development work to support a new product introduction in a country where we want to demonstrate the capability.
We pick and choose a few of those. It’s less than $100 million that’s allocated to that. It’s in that number I gave you. And the rest of our people like Jay Ireland and Ronaldo Garcia and the people that fit in the markets and make the decisions and support the effort that help us win the Algeria deal or the Egypt deal. And so what we’ve found is to operate in 170 countries, you need a core group of people who are there all the time. Because if you think about the Algeria mega-deal, there’s going to be one of those.
And if you’re trying to win that deal by flying people in from other countries and that’s the only way you have to win it, you probably won’t win it. If you don’t have people on the ground -- and not just a country leader, which we have, but a lawyer who understands Algerian law and can take what the Algerians want to accomplish and marry it with what’s good for the GE shareholders, you just don’t win.
So optimizing that cost structure, making it as lean as possible and having the right people who are equipped to make those decisions are what’s allowing us to win some of the big stuff that we’ve been able to win. It’s always a team play, so it’s never GGO by itself. A lot of times, in some markets, the businesses don’t need our help and we stay out of the way. And in other markets, we’re a central ingredient to how we win.
Steve Tusa
Where does the spend peak in the last couple of years? What kind of a peak was that?
John Rice
Well, the peak was probably weak. In the beginning, we had the predecessor organization, the global ops finance was part of GGO. So if you normalize for all of that, the peak was probably a couple hundred million dollars higher. But most of that was program funding. The organization is a little bit smaller than it was if you go back to 2012, but not a lot.
Steve Tusa
Right. When you think about the various parts of the world, there are some good data in the 10-K about some of the growth markets and 15% growth in the Middle East last year, I think 30% growth in Sub-Sahara and Africa, some pretty good numbers. How do we think about Middle East and Africa in kind of the mid to ’15 guidance and kind of going forward given all the cross currents on oil and gas, Nigeria was out-cutting its government budget a couple of weeks ago. Just talk about what you see in Middle East and Africa.
John Rice
Well, there’s no question that prospective orders that are in the pipeline are going to get another review, certainly if it’s in the oil and gas space. Everybody has announced -- pretty much has announced CapEx cuts. Some more, some less, but 10%-ish is a reasonable facsimile of a number. But they haven’t quite figured out exactly where they’re going to -- what’s going to be cut.
So we’re paying a lot of attention to where they’re thinking about cutting and where they’re not thinking about cutting. So that play will run probably for the first three to six months this year so that we understand that some of this complicated subsea stuff is not going to get cut, the drilling in surface is easier to cut and will get cut and probably will get cut a little bit more than 10%.
Steve Tusa
Right, right. Is it possible that maybe in ’16 that the growth markets and the developed markets grow in line? Is that a potential scenario when you look out at your dashboard of the backlog that you have? A lot of companies are seeing that. 3M, for example, had -- U.S. growth was one of their best regions for the first time in several years in the fourth quarter. But it takes a little bit longer to work its way through your revenue stream.
John Rice
Right.
Steve Tusa
I don’t think it’s possible or --
John Rice
It’s certainly not impossible. I think that the U.S. could be good for us. The question is Europe, okay? So when you say developed and you put Europe, that’s a reasonably good-sized piece for us. I’m not ready to say yet that Europe is going to grow great guns, although we see good growth opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe. We had a great year there last year and see more growth prospects this year.
So you can’t paint Europe with the same brush, all of Europe with the same brush. But I think Europe is the key to the answer to your question.
Steve Tusa
And in Latin America there were some pretty strong growth numbers from a couple of our companies in the fourth quarter. Thinking of the real [ph] job of what the -- with what the macro data is saying, I think Mexico is probably doing well, Brazil seems a little bit more of a question mark. What are you seeing and what do you expect for growth in Latin America?
John Rice
I think Brazil is the question that you have to answer. I think you said it. We’ll see. Mexico still looks and feels pretty good to us. Obviously, there’s a lot going on with Petrobras and that has implications for some of the orders that we see. Again, we don’t see cancellations but given the internal focus on business practices, stuff has really slowed down, decision-making processes are much slower. So we’re cautious in how we think about Brazil.
Steve Tusa
When you look at Brazil and you talk about the content that you have on FPSO, I know that you haven’t really gone after some of those tree awards aggressively, the subsea tree awards. But have you been a little more aggressive and a little more successful -- success is probably a bad word because you didn’t go after them -- on the FPSOs down there? Do you have a little more of a clip-hold on the Petrobras FPOs?
John Rice
We’re starting to get one. But we think that there’s a lot of upside for us because, again, we’ve gone after the power generation piece separate from the propulsion piece, separate from the energy management piece. And I was in Korea last week, I met with all the big ship builders. We know now all the CEOs. They are anxious to have a company like ours really compete for more -- and we have relatively small market shares with them compared to what we should have.
So I don’t think about the number of ships they’re going to launch being up or down, frankly. I think about our ability to grow share and we should be able to.
Steve Tusa
You’re still early on that curve.
John Rice
Absolutely.
Steve Tusa
I don’t know if you have that much content on the FPSOs that are in their order books today.
John Rice
No, it’s an enormous space. And again, you could argue that fewer ships will be commissioned over the next couple of years. And over the last couple of years, maybe. But our ability to grow share causes me to not worry about that at all.
Steve Tusa
The tone for many in oil and gas, and given this is one of your bigger global opportunities and you stick with it [ph] and that’s obviously a hot topic, I think back in the fourth quarter, the consensus on oil and gas is that the NOCs would hold up and that they’d continue to spend -- I think there’s been a little bit of a -- perhaps they changed some data points that tell you that they are even kind of wobbling a bit. What’s your take on the appetite of the NOCs right now and what they’re doing?
John Rice
I think they’re going to cut through.
Steve Tusa
Okay.
John Rice
Yes. I think they’re going to cut through. I don’t think they know exactly where they’re going to cut. I’ve been with a couple of the big ones in the last couple of weeks and I think that people are going to be prudent. I don’t think anybody thinks the $50 or $60 a barrel oil is going to be where what we see for a long time. But it certainly could be around for a while.
Steve Tusa
Right. Right When you think about the oil and gas business and the rest of you talked about drilling, obviously. We’ve already seen orders fall off there pretty significantly. What types of projects are you most confident in from a growth perspective? Parts of your business that could hold up for the next couple of years and not see the order volatility that we talked about in the drilling or subsea.
John Rice
Well, from a revenue perspective --
Steve Tusa
In oil and gas.
John Rice
Yes.
Steve Tusa
In oil and gas.
John Rice
From a revenue perspective, the deeper more complicated stuff will continue to go because they can’t turn those off and kind of not follow them for a couple of years and then turn it back on again. There are highly skilled people that are part of these projects. They can’t lose them. So they will go.
I think what happens from an orders perspective will be tied more to how they see the price of oil. And I think, Steve, that the -- my assessment is that there’s a certain amount of churn that comes with $50 a barrel of oil that’s good because there were some inefficient projects, there were stuff that was happening in the industry that didn’t make sense. You had countries, places like Australia where oil and gas companies were paying $150,000 or $200,000 a year for a truck driver because there was so much stuff going on up at the Pilbara that they had to. And that just doesn’t make long-term sense.
So this part of the cycle is going to get some of that cleaned up. I don’t think that’s a bad thing for the industry. I don’t think it’s bad for us. We’ll clean a few things up too.
Steve Tusa
Right. What about on the compression side? And any risk to these big LNG projects that are out there? And just remind me within the Turbo business, how much of that is midstream and upstream?
John Rice
Well, about 65% of it is upstream. Yes, maybe a little bit more. So that’s a lot of it for Turbo.
Steve Tusa
Okay.
John Rice
Yes. I think, look, you still have a lot of places in the world that are paying $14, $15, $15 per MMBTU for --
Steve Tusa
But in these fuel [ph] projects, when you think about the projects that are kind of moving around, I mean you would consider LNG a part of that bucket?
John Rice
There’ll be a little of churn. I think some projects are going to keep going because the economics are good. But the stuff that’s on the edge will probably get a second or third review.
Steve Tusa
Right.
John Rice
And again, I don’t know that that’s an unhealthy thing. I think there were projects that the margin at $100 a barrel or the equivalent for gas that didn’t make sense.
Steve Tusa
On your air [ph] derivatives and your distributed power business, what do you see on demand on that after you had great win Nigeria last year? How do you see the future of that business in the near-term shall lump out in [ph] with the kind of the projects that we’re talking about?
John Rice
I think you get two. It’s kind of a bimodal distribution. You’ve got longer cycle stuff that you can see coming and you have this kind of quick hit emergency, I need power before next summer stuff.
Steve Tusa
Right.
John Rice
And we’re seeing another one of those in North Africa that’s enormous that we’ll be announcing shortly. And the nature of that business is going to be there’s going to be some flow and some triage.
Steve Tusa
Got you.
John Rice
And the fact is, if you look at what’s -- when you talk to presidents and prime ministers and ministers of energy, they are focused on getting stuff done at a rate with a speed dimension that they’ve never had before. I mean in the next country that we’re going to announce, the government is saying, look, for the stability of the country, I need this power in place by May.
Steve Tusa
In that an Algeria size order or not quite an Algeria size order?
John Rice
It’s close to an Algeria size order in the same neighborhood. And it was not on anybody’s radar screen in June of last year, okay? So this is how stuff is happening. So you’ve got some of that that you can’t necessarily predict. But you’ve got to be on it when it happens, okay? So that’s the nature of we talked about localization and having the right people in the right places. If you’re trying to organize the effort to win that deal from headquarters, you’ll never win it.
Steve Tusa
I mean I was surprised to how profitable the Algeria arrows were, but then I guess the turbines were a little bit of a -- the heavy duties were a little of tougher. Is that how it works? You kind of, hey, I guess it’s one sale, but you guys are sort of porting mechanism to us.
John Rice
Yes, yes. Exactly. And you then have to look at the service piece which doesn’t necessarily show in the initial order, but comes --
Steve Tusa
Right. I’m curious because all in the bundle are these -- because the bigger the project, the more sharp the pencil is.
John Rice
Yes. And we now want to look at them in their entirety. It makes sense for us to do that. And I think frankly from the shareholder perspective, it makes a ton of sense.
Steve Tusa
Right.
John Rice
I mean making individual decisions -- I mean the Algerian government looks at GE, they don’t think about a distributed power business and power and water business. They could care less. They say, this is what we need and we need the whole thing to work. And then we say, okay, this is what we need and this is how the whole thing has to come together to be a good deal for our shareholders.
Steve Tusa
Right.
John Rice
So I think we want and I think you want us to look at the entirety.
Steve Tusa
Yes. We’ll pull it out. We’ll pull it out and analyze it ourselves.
John Rice
Yes, you’ll do it faster than most.
Steve Tusa
On the international heavy duty gas turbine market, U.S. seems to be kind of signing some legs here and growing. What do you see outside that megadeal like that? I mean unless there are a lot of megadeals like that. What do you see globally as kind of the market outside U.S., heavy duty gas turbine market growth rate over the next couple of years?
John Rice
There’s a ton of interest in the H. A number of -- we’ve booked orders for ’15. We have received kind of technical confirmation from another 30 that we now have to finish the negotiation. And maybe not all of them become orders, but most of them should. And a number of those increasingly are outside the U.S. So we see a lot of interest in the H technology.
Steve Tusa
So can your non-U.S. shipments, will they be I guess in a flattish market, you guys take a little bit of the share. The non-U.S. shipments, are they flat to down? Are they growing in the next couple of years unit-wise?
John Rice
I think they should be able to -- I mean I think they will be flat to up slightly.
Steve Tusa
You think up.
John Rice
Yes.
Steve Tusa
Okay.
John Rice
Yes.
Steve Tusa
And then lastly, I guess just on the oil -- two more questions. On the oil and gas backlog, what percentage of the year do we have booked or what percentage is coming?
John Rice
60%.
Steve Tusa
60%. And was that 70% in the December alloc meeting or was that changed at all, the backlog?
John Rice
I don’t think so.
Steve Tusa
Backlog hasn’t.
John Rice
Yes.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Okay. And then one last question. Jeff Bornstein comes in last year, a little bit of a change in the corporate office. What have you seen differently? There’s been definitely a positive reception. What have you seen him bring as a positive change to the executive, to its kind of executive office in the corporate office here?
John Rice
Well, look, I think he did some terrific things when he was the CFO. I think Jeff brings a perspective that’s very similar in some ways and different in other ways. And that’s what you want with a change. Just like Keith moving into GE Capital and replacing Mike is replaced a great leaders with a great leader.
I think when you look at the sum and stubs into what’s going on in GE right now whether you think about the portfolio changes that have really allowed us to focus on infrastructure in a way that we didn’t when we were in media and we had plastics and appliances, focused on infrastructure in a world that needs it, thinking about the right balance between global and local, simplification which is completely redoing the back room and then resizing capital. You’ve got four hugely significant efforts underway at one time that will totally transform this company.
And what I say to our internal people is the young kind of talent is -- the young kind of talent is you’re working on stuff that will shape what GE looks like in 2050. And that we’ve never had so much meaningful stuff going on at the same time. We thought Six Sigma was meaningful, we thought LEAN was meaningful. And they’re good but this is transformational. And Jeff Bornstein is, like the rest of us, right in the middle of it.
Unidentified Analyst
Has he been the catalyst for a lot of this, do you think?
John Rice
I think it’s a collective catalyst. Yes, he’s certainly contributing his part in a good way. He’s a very smart guy. And like a lot of good GE leaders, he says what he thinks. And that’s what you got to have.
Steve Tusa
What’s next for you?
John Rice
Who knows? I think I’m doing what I should be doing right now. I honestly do. I think that this is an opportunity to make the company work in the best way it can globally. I think I’m the right person to do it. And doing what I’m -- continuing to do what I do is what’s next for me.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Really appreciate the time.
John Rice
Thanks.
