Meet Your Next Employer at Mashable's Online Career Expo
Are you looking to make your next great career move in 2013? Mashable is here to help and proud to announce its 2013 Online Career Expos, a virtual series of nationwide events that will connect you with leading employers in live, engaging conversations.
By participating in these events, you will discover new career opportunities from employers who are eager to hire people like you with skills in business, design, development, marketing, social media and tech. You will chat directly with recruiters online and build your network by continuing your conversations with them weeks (and often, months) after the event.
“I have to say this was the best recruiting event I've ever attended hands down!” shared one job seeker who attended the October 2012 Mashable Online Career Expo: SF to LA.
The 2012 Career Expo events welcomed more than 50 employers and hundreds of job seekers. Based on the success of our series thus far, we will expand our reach and host nine virtual events nationwide in 2013 — hitting the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and West Coast.
The first event will cover the Northeast (NY, DC, Boston and Philadelphia) and will take place on April 10. Registration for each event opens 10 weeks in advance, but sign up now to get on the early invite list for the events that interest you.
