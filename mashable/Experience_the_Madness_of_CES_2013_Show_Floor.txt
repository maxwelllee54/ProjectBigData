Experience the Madness of CES 2013 Show Floor

International CES 2013 officially opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, welcoming attendees to more than 1.85 square miles of vendor space and over 3,000 vendors. About 150,000 people are expected to rush through the cavernous grounds, taking a look at the latest in televisions, tablets, computers and more.
Check out Mashable Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff as he takes you on a tour of the CES show floor. It's almost as good as being there in person â€” with the added benefit of not having to walk from North Hall to South Hall four times in one day!
