Simon Hales
Okay. I think everyone can take their seats. We might try and get the next session underway.
Well, good morning, everybody. Welcome to everyone here in the room and for those joining us on the webcast. I am Simon Hales, for those of you who don’t know. I am heading up European Consumer Staples Research at Barclays, but also Global Tobacco Research as well.
And it’s my pleasure and our pleasure to once again welcome Altria back to the Consumer Staples Conference. Once again I will represent it here, here on stage with me, with Billy Gifford, Altria’s CFO, and we're also joined in the room by [Denise Keane] from IR and it's also great to have our formal colleague, Mr. Bill Marshall with us who is now VP of Investor Relations at Altria. So welcome Bill and congratulations on your new role.
Now as you can see for those of you in the room we're going to be conducting today’s session as a fireside chat rather than a formal presentation from Billy.
Before we get into that, I just need to set out some parameters around the discussion and to make you all aware that due to Barclay's involvement in the pending ABI-SABMiller transaction, we won’t be discussing either in the fireside chat or the Q&A anything in relation to the deal itself.
So with that in mind, perhaps we can get probably underway Billy.
Billy Gifford
Sure.
Simon Hales
And perhaps I could start from a higher level standpoint, maybe you could talk us through briefly some of Altria’s financial goals and your overall strategies?
Billy Gifford
Sure, before I get start with those, thank you for the invite and giving us a chance to present the company today.
I think when you think about Altria at the highest level, we really have kind of two goals or objectives, financial goals or objectives that we pursue. The first grow our adjusted diluted EPS 7% to 9% over time.
And then the second with the cash that produces, return a large portion of that cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and that’s what the 80% dividend target payout ratio.
In pursuit of those goals we really follow three strategies. The first one is to maximize the core tobacco businesses that we own, those premium businesses. The second is generate new income streams from innovative tobacco products and then the third is to manage those diverse income streams and our strong balance sheet, to kind of deliver consistent financial performance through time. So it’s from a high level, Simon, that’s what I would characterize.
Simon Hales
And how do you think you're executing around those goals as things stand today?
Billy Gifford
Sure, I would say we're doing very well. But I don’t want you to take my word for it. You really should look at kind of the performance through time.
If you look over the past five years for instance right, even through some of the tough times with the recession and things of that nature, we returned on a compounded annual growth 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth.
If you think about the 80% dividend target payout ratio through that time, paid out almost $19 billion in dividends to our shareholders.
So that’s over a longer period of time, but even if you look at just the first half of this year, great performance in the first half. You look at EPS grew adjusted diluted EPS almost 11% through the first half of this year.
The segments are performing great, with the smokable segment grown about 6.7 with margin increasing over 200 basis points. The smokeless segment growing a little bit over 15% and their margins expanding as well.
So we really feel good about our performance thus far and we were happy to be able to raise guidance in their second quarter earnings release to 7.5% to 9.5% from a total year perspective.
Simon Hales
When you talk about the strong first half deliveries from an earnings standpoint and that raise to guide us, do you think that the 7.5% to 9.5% guidance for the full year is looking a little bit conservative given that performance you've had year-to-date?
Billy Gifford
Simon, we feel good about where we're positioned and really our full-year outlook, I think if you look at the first half we had great performance, but it was against tough comps and so when you think about that as we go through the year, we'll continue to face those tough comps.
And they are couple of watch-outs in the back half. We had a couple of state excise tax increases, the one I would mention is Pennsylvania that represents about 5% of industry volume. So from that standpoint that’s an SET increase and we always keep an eye on those.
A couple of the other watch-outs is we had a shipping day, extra shipping day in the first half of the year that will be paid back in the second half of the year and so from a total standpoint, we really feel good about it. There will be tough comps, but it’s something that we plan for and so we feel good about our overall outlook.
Simon Hales
Maybe we could just talk a little bit more about the state of the adult tobacco market in the U.S. how are they fairing in the current macroeconomic environment and how is this influencing do you think purchasing patents and decisions?
Billy Gifford
Sure, it’s a great question Simon. I’ll you there have been a number of macroeconomic factors influencing our consumers. Three I would mention are gas prices, unemployment rates and housing starts.
When you think about those factors, we had a huge tailwind, our consumer did throughout the year of '15. Those factors are still there, but they won’t be as much of a benefit in 2016 as in comparison to what we benefited and our consumer benefited in '15.
So, I would say from a characterization, the overall consumer economic status is still very constructive, but there will be tough comps as we move through the year, take gas prices for instance, right.
Still down on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially we’ve seen those gas prices starting to ease up and so again just not the tailwind we experienced as we went through '15.
Simon Hales
So, it’s best to say that the strong relative volumes that we’ve seen in the U.S. market over the last 18 month, that’s not the new normal there and then how would you think about the medium term outlook overall given what you've just said?
Billy Gifford
Yeah, you're right, 2015 the overall industry volume was roughly flat and a lot of that was due to those tailwinds that we just talked about. We were asked a lot about that flat volume and hey is this a break in trend and we were looking at those factors that make up that volume decline prevalence, secular decline, those types of things that cause that line of decline and we were seeing those factors change and we kept letting everyone know that hey our long term trend seems to stand that we would predict that it would be down kind of 3% to 4% through time.
It was just a matter of time of how long it took to get back to that and I think we're starting to see kind of overall industry volumes move back in the direction.
Simon Hales
And away from those topline trends and earlier in the year you announced $300 million productivity savings program? How is that progressing?
Billy Gifford
That's something that the overall organization has really been focused on this year. When we announced it, we said look there are really kind of two primary areas we’re looking to identify that productivity in.
The first being kind of our sales, general and administrative function, we really wanted to trim cost there looking to both kind of the overall infrastructure we had in place as well as some of the third party spend there.
The second was really kind of getting to a leaner organization. That leaner organization what we wanted to do was really reduce layers in the organization and increase spends of control.
We wanted to pick up their speed to market and their speed to really set decision rights in place. So our organization, the new structure was complete by the end of the first quarter. So, we’re well on our way I think to achieve in that $300 million by the end of 2017 that we set up forth.
Simon Hales
And when we think about $300 million, how should we think about, how we see that in through your P&L? How much of that should we think to see we actually reinvested back into the business and what areas of that business and if we see that reinvestment should we be looking for that to go into?
Billy Gifford
So another great question Simon, when we announced that $300 million, we said we were going to reinvest some of that money back into the business and we really called out three places. One was around brand building. The second was around regulatory capability and so we really were looking at how would we reinvest back into the business.
And so the example around the brand building was really around the digital investments that we've talked about for a while is that digital investment around the brand and really kind of the Marlboro side of that and being able to reach the consumer where they're at.
And then we wanted to make sure from a regulatory capability standpoint that we had the processes and the systems in place to be able to navigate the overall regulatory landscape. So those reinvestments we feel like help us from a long-term expected to reach those financial goals through time.
Simon Hales
Okay. And maybe we can move away to some of the high level stuff perhaps to drill down a little bit more into Smokeable segment, and you could talk a little bit about the performance specifically of the Marlboro franchise?
Billy Gifford
Yes I would be happy to talk about Marlboro. We're actually very proud of the Marlboro brand. When you think about the Smokeable segment, I would just remind you that we grew about 6.7% in the first half. Then it was really behind the strength of Marlboro.
We were able to sustain kind of Marlboro at record high levels to be able to grow at that basis. The Marlboro brand is very strong. We feel like it resonates well with the consumer and we are very excited about kind of the future of Marlboro and where it's heading.
Simon Hales
And then could you give a little bit more color on the individual brands within the family?
Billy Gifford
Sure. So if you think about it you will remember that we put in place the Marlboro architecture. So it's still one brand, still has the same values across all of it, but underneath it, we divided that architecture into four brand flavor families is what we call it. It's Marlboro Red, Marlboro Gold, Marlboro Green and Marlboro Black.
The new architecture allowed us to really connect with the adult consumer, kind of the deeper level almost a personal level.
If you think about that one brand, one set of values for the entire brand the Marlboro brand, but it allows us to reach the consumer and display those values differently across those four flavor families.
So take care of Marlboro Black, the newest edition to the kind of the Marlboro brand family, we were able to be a bit edgier, a bit bolder with Marlboro Black than we had previously been on any of the other flavor families within Marlboro.
So it really resonated well with that adult cigarette consumer aged 21 to 29, it's connected well with them. So this architecture was a form of innovation on the brand. Innovation is not just about new products. So I mentioned Marlboro architecture, Marlboro digital and the investments we are making there and we feel like there is another innovation on the brand and we feel like again the brand family and architecture and these innovations really set us up as well for Marlboro moving forward into the future.
Simon Hales
And on wider points where you were little over a year on now from completion of the rentals, low transactions we had Imperial Tobacco here speaking this morning and talking about the U.S. markets, can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape that you see it now in the U.S. what’s perhaps changed over the last 12 or so months and how Altria is adjusting the landscape?
Billy Gifford
Yeah, I think it’s important to put it in perspective. When you step back from any merger or acquisitions or things of that nature, you have to remember consumers really choose brands in the marketplace. They don’t choose the companies that own those brands.
So, all of these brands while were already in the marketplace and we were already competing against those. From a standpoint of the actual merger and the impact on the competitive activities, the cigarette category has always been competitive and yeah there are different executions around the brands, for instance Reynolds taken their Newport brand to the West Coast.
But we've competed effectively against these brands. We know consumers really focus on brands and choose brands, so when you get to the bottom of it or the essence of it, it’s not an adjustment on the standpoint. We're really focused on executing against our strategies and our plans. We monitor their competitive activities, but it really is about flawless execution of their strategy.
Simon Hales
You haven’t particularly noticed any major changes in the pricing environment over the last 12 months and I think the vast changes or influences the way you think about…
Billy Gifford
Yeah, I’ll be little careful talking about pricing because that’s a careful subject, but let’s talk about what we were able to do, if you think about over a recent period, our price realization has been between 4% and 5%.
As I mentioned, we grew OCI search all down to the bottom in the first half 6.7%. So, yeah there are competitive activities taken place, but again its nothing out of the nature. It's always been competitive. I think with those OCI results, with price realization in the 4% to 5% range, you can see that we're able to compete in that environment just fine.
Simon Hales
Marlboro's price gap compared to some of the discounts Altria has been narrowing of late, is there an opportunity you think that you'll be able to take some more pricing.
Billy Gifford
Yeah, I think you really have to think about the Marlboro's price gap and kind of pull it apart a little bit. That price gap is Marlboro net, it's the net price of Marlboro against the cheapest brand in the store and so it’s not against any particular brand, it's just what the cheapest the consumer can find in the store.
When you think about price, this is something that we watch again with price realization or in fact we feel good about what we’ve been able to achieve in that environment.
One thing to note on the price gap is there is a bit of math involved in that, so if you think about that price gap, the premium price or Marlboro's net price increase and the discount increases, there will be some natural narrowing in the gap, the percentage gap, just due to the nature of math.
So the price gap is something that we watch, but it really is we feel good about what we've been able to achieve kind of through the first half.
Simon Hales
Last week you talked a bit about L&M, it's performed strongly and are you increasing your focus behind L&M and perhaps where it's sourcing its growth from?
Billy Gifford
Sure. I think there are a couple of things you have to consider when you look at L&M's brand performance. First of all, it's a great product, it has broad appeal and has a great value equation, but it really competes in the discount segment of the cigarette category and that's where, it's garnering its share from is really in the discount segment.
If you want to look at the discount brands that have been losing share, you can look at Pall Mall and some of the other items. So that's where it's garnering that share from, but remember from a premium discount segment in the industry, discount has been able to decline. So it's garnering share of that declining segment.
And so to answer your question directly Simon, no, we haven’t changed our focus. We are glad to have it in our portfolio, but our focus is in Marlboro being the premium brand in the marketplace.
Simon Hales
Maybe we could talk a bit about Smokeless and that side of your business. Clearly the category seems to be bouncing back a little bit and what do you think is driving that trend and could we expect to return back to mid single-digit growth rate?
Billy Gifford
Sure we've been excited about the Smokeless segment. I mentioned it grew 15%. So we're performing very well. I think when you look at the overall industry, there are couple of things to consider.
You really have to think about those same economic factors we were talking about on the cigarette side or the smokeable side. You have to think about -- we're seeing those same economic benefits for the consumer in the Smokeless space.
From a standpoint of category, as eBay came on the scene, there are a lot more choices for our adult consumer in the marketplace and so that will continue to influence the overall growth in the Smokeless category.
And then I think when you think about kind of the trend, we have seen a trend of about 3% industry growth kind of over the last call it six quarters and so from a standpoint as that appears to be kind of the trend that we've seen in the most recent period over a longer term that we would tend to call a trend versus the shorter term period.
So I think when you look at that, that 3% seems like that is the trend in the current marketplace and we're performing well in that.
Simon Hales
And how does Copenhagen Mint fits into the smokeless strategy overall? How would you characterize the opportunity for that?
Billy Gifford
We're extremely excited about Copenhagen Mint. I would say it squarely in the strategy. If you just step back for a second and I’ll remind you of that strategy in this segment.
When you think about the smokeless category strategy for Altria it really is about growing income by growing our volume ahead of kind of the overall category growth rate while maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined.
And so when you think about Copenhagen Mint, this is the first full quarter of measurement for that after the launch, and so we feel great about it. It's early yet, but it’s very similar to what we did with Wintergreen.
Remember Wintergreen we allowed Copenhagen to enter the Wintergreen space. It was a growing segment at the time. That's why we allow Copenhagen to enter the mint category because it's a growing space and that allows Copenhagen to participate in those growing segments.
So we're very excited about Copenhagen Mint, but I would still say it's a bit early on being one quarter of measurement.
Simon Hales
Perhaps like a segue from smokeless into innovation and that side of your portfolio, could you update a little bit on where you are would you e-vapor platforms?
Billy Gifford
Yes, I'd be happy to. We are in latest e-vapor product in MarkTenXL and we're extremely excited about that. I think when you think about the e-vapor space, though our approach is about discipline, there are still a lot to affect the e-vapor category, new deeming that takes place and how does that deeming affect overall category growth rate. Technology will be a big factor in that. How does the technology improve through time for our consumer?
And I think the taxing regime, I would say overall taxes are fairly nonexistent. There are few instances of taxing at the state level, but I would say they're nonexistent. So how does that unfold through time?
So we feel like a disciplined approach is appropriate. The approach we've taken with MarkTenXL the kind of describe that discipline is we really wanted to be where e-vapor volume is, and so we're in approximately 44,000 stores. We've been kind of methodically expanding that through time.
So currently we're in about 44,000 stores. That represents the more presence in where 50% of overall e-vapor category is. So backing up, we feel like that financially disciplined approach to that innovative space specifically e-vapor is the right approach.
Simon Hales
An area of it's probably gotten more excitement over the last couple of years, arguably e-vapor has been the excitement seen around the iQOS product, how would you characterize maybe the opportunity for that brand from an Altria standpoint.
Billy Gifford
I think there has been a lot of excitement around iQOS and look we’re extremely excited to have it as part of our product portfolio. When we think about innovative tobacco products, we think about it as a portfolio approach.
E-vapor is one piece of it. iQOS will be the second piece of it. And so it's really about providing our consumer who wants something as an alternative with a portfolio of products to let them decide where they want to land and we think heat-not-burn shows promise in providing that alternative to the consumer.
We have to go through the FDA process with iQOS. We're supporting PMI in their FDA application. I think the expectation there is you should expect it to be followed by the end of 2016. So there's still a while to go.
I think from our standpoint, as we're helping them and aiding them in the application process, we're also working on kind of their marketing plans and the commercialization plans for the U.S. So we're happy to have it in our portfolio and we'll share more information when it's appropriate.
Simon Hales
And so generally took away e-vapor and iQOS and heat-not-burn opportunities you seen the tobacco industry generally stepping up investments in these new product categories over the last few years.
How do you balance the need to invest for growth in those ineffective areas while continue to maintain a predictable cash flow, which is obviously one of the core attractions of you was another stock from a tobacco investor standpoint?
Billy Gifford
Sure. It's a great question Simon and I think you used the right term balance. It is about balance. We really have to focus on our core premium tobacco businesses and grow those while using some of the funds that are generated from that growth to fund the innovated tobacco space and it really is a fine balance there.
With the innovated tobacco space, we really want to provide our consumers with what they want. But it's investing there and I'll use the term again financially disciplined investments because we also want to reward our shareholders with the growth expectations that they have for us and the dividends that we pay them.
And so it's a fine balance of investing for the future for the potential that it provides while at the same time maximizing kind of the core tobacco businesses that we own.
Simon Hales
We would be remiss if we didn't discuss some of the external influencing factors on your business and perhaps we can talk a little bit about the regulatory environment in it for a minute.
What's Altria’s view on the final deeming regulations that we have seen? Did they come in really as you broadly expected and are there any particular areas now within those regulations that are cause for concern, that we should be thinking about in the medium term as cause for concern?
Billy Gifford
Sure, it’s a bit a while in the coming, but we're happy to have clarity about the deeming process and the especially the deeming on the two new categories. I think they came in basically as we expected. If I had to point out some highlights, I would say one highlight from a positive standpoint is the recognition of this continuum of risk.
And the FDA throughout the deeming really talk about this continuum of risk and that it would be a factor and aiming what so far as to say that eBay beholds promise for reduce risk versus combustible cigarettes.
If I had to flip it and say, what was one thing that we would point out that wasn’t as positive as we would like, it was the predicate date. That predicate date just for everybody in the room is really about when you have to have FDA approval to have the product in the marketplace.
And so we feel like holding the predicate date back to where they held it, really has the opportunity to possibly aspire for innovation in this kind of exciting space around potentially reducing the risk to overall and improving public health from a tobacco standpoint.
You may have also -- you may have in your mind what about the use of mile because there is a lot of coverage around our trademark Black & Mild, would we be able to continue to use it. It was an issue, but I am happy to say that’s resolved and we'll be able to continue to use Black & Mild in the marketplace.
So it came out largely as expected. We continue to engage with the FDA. We think that’s the constructive way to really kind of bring about the right regulation to the overall industry and really to have the essence of what Congress I think met when they provided the Tobacco Prevention Act.
Simon Hales
Perhaps we could just talk about the trend that we've seen of raising the minimum age of purchasing tobacco products and how you see that developing affecting your business?
Billy Gifford
Sure. I think just a level side, remember from going to age 21 standpoint is only really been passed in two states, the State of Hawaii and then most recently the State of California.
I think when you think about that, our position is, we really supported the FDA process and that Tobacco Prevention Control Act really talked about the process that was established there was that it would be debated study by the FDA and then debated at the congressional level and we feel like that’s the right process.
You remember when the Tobacco Control Act came out, it used 18 as the minimum age. When their settlement agreement was signed between the industry and the 50 state AGs that use 18 as the minimum age.
So we really support that process of where there is a healthy debate supported by science and studies that have been taken place in the marketplace so we think that’s the right place.
But in the mean time I would take you back. We’ve gone through and managed our way through regulation before. You could use the indoor smoking bans that kind of started the same way in one state and kind of worked their selves across the nation. So we are -- I think are very effective in being able to manage our way through these types of regulations.
Simon Hales
You made a reference earlier in some of the comments at the beginning about discussion around state excise tax moves that we've seen, more broadly. How should we think about state excise tax and the state excise tax environment through the remainder of 2016?
Billy Gifford
Sure, state excise taxes proposals are still pretty prevalent at the state level. This year so far we faced state excise tax increases in Louisiana, West Virginia and then I mentioned most recently Pennsylvania. It is something that we keep a watch on. You may have seen some of the press coverage on the qualified balled initiatives. That's in four states, the one I would point out is California.
We have a great government affairs group and they monitor these state excise tax proposals and they will engage when they think it’s appropriate to engage on them.
Simon Hales
Okay. Perhaps we can move on to balance sheet and capital allocation, I know within the business, clearly you've done a great job of returning cash to shareholders, what’s your view on the current capital position about the group and how does that influence your plans to perhaps return cash in the future?
Billy Gifford
You right to point out Simon that we take capital allocations seriously and part of that is returning a large portion of that cash back to shareholders. If you think about that five year period, I mentioned that we paid out almost $19 billion in dividends.
At the same time, or some of the excess cash after that, call it $4.95 billion that we repurchase shares with. The way we step to kind of the capital allocation process is, first and foremost because we have highly profitable businesses as capital expenditures, but for a company our size, it's very, very small from a capital expenditure standpoint that actually it trails beneath depreciation on a regular basis.
So I feel that's taken care of. Of course then it's the 80% dividend payout to our shareholders and that leaves some excess cash and you’ve seen us take several activities related to that excess cash. Of course we’ve done share repurchase. You've seen us do debt tenders refis. You saw us last year do a straight debt tender.
We go through that analysis and try to put that cash to use to the best benefit of our shareholders overall and our debt holder. So, that’s the way we think about the capital allocation process and we feel good about the cash we’ve been able to return to our shareholders.
Simon Hales
I don't want to hold this Q&A session alone. So I do want to leave a little bit of time in the room for some questions, but perhaps before we go to that of interesting perhaps any final thoughts that you have would like to share with us in areas we haven’t covered some of the areas you would like to discover and how generally perhaps you see the future unfolding.
Billy Gifford
Sure, I think the way I would look at it and really put it forward is we think Altria is a great investment. I’ve mentioned the two growth trajectories, grow adjusted diluted EPS and 7 and 9, pay out 80% of our cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends.
I think you’ve heard the track record 8% compounded annual growth time almost $19 billion or just about $19 billion in dividends paid over that same five-year period.
I think we have great businesses in their core tobacco with premium brands, Marlboro in the cigarette space, like the Marlboro cigars, Copenhagen and Skoal smokeless. You've seen their performance through the first half growing adjusted diluted EPS almost 11% or right at 11%.
I think that track record proves that we're able to manage the business through tough times and great times in that overall we feel good about the future.
As you think about that same five-year period and you just think about it from a total shareholder return, Altria has 230% total shareholder return, benched against the S&P food and beverage of about a 100%. So, again able to outperform the S&P through a pretty tough time, so it's kind of the way I’d encapsulate it Simon.
Simon Hales
Brilliant, Billy, thank you. And we’ve got a little bit of time for some questions in the room, which we have some, but before we go into that just remind people that we do have Barclays restriction. We can't talk about anything in relation to the deal, but please any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Thanks. Could you update us on your current thinking on the Snus market in the U.S. and then maybe also non-tobacco nicotine products that could be smokeless tobacco replacements and what your thinking is there?
Billy Gifford
Yes it's a great question, so thank you for the question. I think from a standpoint of Snus, it's still a very small market. We have Snus out in our Skoal brand, so it's Skoal snus in the marketplace.
We're pleased with the way it's performing, but again it's a very small business. Again it's part of our portfolio approach having a portfolio of alternative products that consumers would choose as an alternative to combustible cigarettes. From a standpoint of you said non-nicotine tobacco.
Unidentified Analyst
Non-tobacco nicotine replacement of late.
Billy Gifford
Sure we have a couple of products in kind of test market that we're learning from the consumer to use in that disciplined approach again, it's called [Ver] and we have in test markets and so what we do is we gather consumer feedback, make adjustments and then launch those new adjustments back into the marketplace.
I would point to the e-vapor as another form of that where it's a non-tobacco or tobacco-derived nicotine without tobacco as an alternative to consumers and you see us compete in that space as well.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Yes, just sticking on the Snus as well which is obviously still very small, do you think as still waiting what kind of health guidelines is going to be on the packet for that and it seems to be taking forever, but if and when it comes and assuming it's a relatively benign outcome, do you think that would be some kind of catalyst to see that category grow?
Billy Gifford
I think we'll have to wait and see. It's a great question from a consumer standpoint of how does they reduce time, that it fits reduced time we don’t know, how it will come out of the FDA. If there is a reduced harm message that can be associated with Snus overall, whether that has an impact on the consumer.
I think the consumer desires the alternative, the alternative is there for him. It's just a matter of in a sense what attracts them to the alternatives in the marketplace. So we will have to wait and see, but we monitor it closely.
Simon Hales
Any more questions in the room?
Simon Hales
Okay. Well I think with that Billy, thank you ever so much for taking the time. Thank you to the IR team as well and we'll move out of the breakout session in a couple of minutes. But thank you Billy.
Billy Gifford
Thanks again, Simon.
