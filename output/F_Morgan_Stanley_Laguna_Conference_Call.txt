Executives
David Schoch - Group Vice President and President, Asia Pacific
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Okay, so let’s get started with the next presentation. I am very pleased to have representing Ford Motor Company, David Schoch, Group Vice President, Ford Motor Company and President of Asia-Pacific region, including responsibilities for China. David have some prepared remarks about the state of business and the strategy of Ford, which has been in an incredibly fast growing trajectory in recent years and more to come I am sure and then we will pop in the Q&A. David, thanks very much for being with us.
David Schoch
Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. How is everybody doing, okay? Yes, fantastic. Well, I am really pleased to be here today and to be able to share with you a little bit about the journey that Ford is making in Asia-Pacific. You know that we have been making some large investments there. And today, I want to talk to you a little bit about our business, our strategy, our growth and then where we see the market headed. And we will start off with the ONE Ford plan, which many of you are very familiar with, but it is the foundation for everything that we are doing.
Okay, working. So, this is what I will cover. I will talk about our strategy, our business environment, executing our plan, achieving effective scale and a little bit about the progress that we are making in Asia-Pacific. And as I mentioned, it all starts with the ONE Ford plan. And it continues to guide us in everything that we do. So, we are continuing to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably, to accelerate the development of new products that our customers want, to finance our plan and improve the balance sheet and then to work effectively as one team. And we are committed to operating in all of the major markets delivering vehicles with a full range of best-in-class vehicles and that would be small, medium, large and cars, utilities and trucks, and profitable growth for all.
The plan, the key element basically is accelerating the development of products that our customers want. And today, we are continuing to strengthen that product portfolio while aggressively expanding in markets around the world. At the same time, we are focused on two brands, the Ford brand and the Lincoln brand. And our promise to our customers is really around our four pillars of quality, green, safe and smart. The plan continues as we improve the time to market, as we increase the scale we have around the world and optimize our footprint and our localization around the world.
The platform strategy underpins basically everything that we do. And as we look around the world, we have now reduced our global platforms to 9 core platforms. And over 85% of our products right now are based on these 9 platforms around the world. This obviously give us scale, more products, faster product cadence and optimizing and leveraging the volume. And take for instance just the Focus platform, the C-car, which is the blue at the top. We are leveraging over 10 different top hats off of that platform at a scale of about 2.4 million units. So, we are leveraging these platforms globally and more.
When I take a look at Asia-Pacific, the foundation of our Asia-Pacific strategy is really based on the ONE Ford plan. And in Asia-Pacific, we are basically bringing 50 new vehicles over the next decade into - vehicles and powertrains into Asia-Pacific and we will continue to deliver our promise of 15 vehicles by 2015. We are growing our dealer network. We are investing in capacity, which I will talk about in a little bit later. We have introduced regional hubs, export hubs in Thailand and also in India and of course we are growing our partnership with our joint ventures in China.
In China, we are approaching the market basically in four distinct activities. Shown on the left is our joint venture with Changan Ford and that’s primarily our non-premium passenger vehicles is an unconsolidated joint venture which we own 50%. Our commercial truck business is through Jiangling Motors. We own 32% equity stake in JMC and that is primarily driving our commercial truck business. We then have Ford imports. And an example of that would be the Explorers or the Edge vehicles that we are bringing in built-up into China and very exciting news we are just about to launch Lincoln in China later in October.
The business environment and this slide really gets my blood going, when I look at it. When you take a look at the growth of Asia-Pacific over the last decade or so, you can see that it’s dramatically improved from a global share of around 23%, back when the industry was about 58 million to over 47% by the time we get to 2020. And we expect Asia-Pacific to be about 51 million units by the time we get to 2020 and of that China will be 32 million or about 30%. And when you think about China last year, 2013 was an industry of around 22 million and we expected to continue to grow to 32 million by the time we get to 2020. There is still a lot of growth left in China and it’s something that we are watching very closely.
In China, you can see I just mentioned, we are up from 23 million to 32 million, but we are also seeing growth in India and also in the ASEAN markets, not as fast and as robust as we have seen in China, but nevertheless growing opportunities throughout Asia-Pacific. What’s driving China industry is primarily first-time buyers. These are buyers that are coming into the market having enough disposable income to be able to purchase a vehicle. And most, over 70% of our buyers are first-time buyers with Ford. So, we are getting them into the Ford products and then be able to walk them up as their disposable income becomes greater. In China as well, we are facing – the industry is facing challenges around fuel economy and also environmental standards. China, you can see that the pace at which they want to accelerate the fuel economy standards is moving faster than both what you see in North America and in Europe and this is going to present a challenge for all of the industry in terms of being able to meet these emerging standards.
Executing our business, if you walk into a showroom, three years ago, you would see only a handful of vehicles. Through our ONE Ford plan and our global platforms, we have been able to substantially accelerate the choices that we are giving our customers. And when you walk into a showroom today, you are going to see much more product giving the customer more choices. The ones that are shown in the box are the ones that we are actually launching this year. So, we have got a lot of new programs coming in, the Mondeo, freshing the Mondeo. We have got the new Mustang coming in towards the end of this year. And then of course very exciting for us, we will be launching the Lincoln brand basically at the end of October. Last week was a very important milestone for us. The first boat of built-up units, MKZ and the MKC arrived in China. So, we are now preparing them for sale in our dealers. We will have 8 dealers up and running by the end of this year. And by 2016, we will have – we are targeting 50 dealers of Lincoln’s throughout China.
We are also bringing in our cutting-edge technologies, MyFord Touch and SYNC, again, all around our pillars of quality, green, safe and smart and also bringing in our EcoBoost engines that will deliver about 20% incremental fuel economy and reduce emissions by around – CO2 emissions by around 15%.
In Nanjing we have a research and engineering center. We started this about 10 years ago. And the early phases, we had about 100 people and they were primarily there to help us localize and localization of parts and help us with product launches. Over the years, we have grown that skill set in Nanjing and they are now basically participating and be able to design and develop top hats off of the global platforms. And as we move further along, we intend to continue to grow the skill teams in Nanjing, where they will basically be able to lead the efforts in our new top hats.
Ford Credit in Asia-Pacific is very, very important to us. They are our strategic partner and they are growing with us. Right now, about 20% of vehicles are financed in China, so relatively small. But our view over the next decade as the capital markets improve, there will be much more financing requirements in China. And we see that in the demographics, because the young people in China are much more inclined to finance than perhaps their parents. So, we see a changing dynamic in China that will really help us grow and deliver Ford Credit. In addition, we have announced earlier this year that we will be going back, Ford Credit will be returning to India to support our growth there. We expect in early 2015 to be up and running with Ford Credit.
Achieving effective scale, I mentioned to you we were expanding capacity. Over the last 2.5 years, we have opened 5 new plants in Asia-Pacific. And in the next year, in the next 12 months, we will have another 5 plants that we will be opening 3 in China and 2 in India. And by the time we are done, at the end of 2015, our assembly capacity in Asia-Pacific will be about 2.7 million units, 1.9 million of those units would be related to – would be in China. So, we are expanding our capacity all over Asia-Pacific with a concentration on China. This is just a picture we have got – these are the 5 plants we have up and just about ready to launch Chongqing Plant #3. We have a new plant in Hangzhou. In Ford India, we have both an assembly plant and also a powertrain plant going up in Sanand and then in Nanchang in the Xiaolan plant we have an engine plant coming on board later next year.
I talked a little about effective scale and we have basically taken our Thailand operations and also our India operations and we are leveraging them to export units around the world. So we are not only satisfying domestic demand, but this gives us the flexibility to move products around the world and the latest one is actually we have just launched the new EcoSport started exporting out of India into Europe. So I have showed you the product that we have coming in. We have the capacity coming on board, now we need to expand dealer distribution network. And this slide shows you the pace at which we are expanding our dealer networking in China. Obviously with the growth there primarily being in the Tier 4, 5 and 6 cities we are also expanding our presence in India and Asia not at the same pace as China simply because the growth isn’t moving quite as fast, but certainly our market coverage and our market distribution and our attention to sales and service satisfaction for our customers is very, very important to our future growth.
In terms of our progress on the left hand side you can see the growth in our share in totally Asia-Pacific and then on the right hand side you can see the shares we have achieved in China and in the July-August period, we were at about 4.8% growing from a little over 3% back in 2012. And all of that is really on the strength of our new products that we are bringing in both the ones we have developed with our joint venture partners and also the built-up ones and then we will add to that Lincoln as we launch it later this year and grow into next year.
In the first half of this year, we made $450 million. So, we are profitably growing. We are continuing to invest an awful lot of money as I have shared with you in terms of capacity dealer distribution further products. The first half was a record for us. Second half will probably not be quite as profitable, because as we look it’s a first half, second half look. The second half we have basically – we are starting to incur the cost associated with the five plans that we will be bringing on, but actually we won’t be launching anything yet until early next year. So, we are incurring those costs. And then we have got the cost associated with launching the Lincoln. So, we maintain our guidance basically that we will be better than 2013, but it is a first half, second half look, but second half being not quite as profitable as the first half. This is our growth story. We are getting into solid profitable growth while still investing in the capacity, leverage our ONE Ford global product plans, and you can see the progression of our profits over the last couple of years.
Now, earlier this year, our initial guidance was that we would be about equal to 2013 in terms of profits. And several months ago, given the pace of the first half, we raised it and basically said we would be higher in terms of external guidance. And when I think about 2015, I do believe that we can expect in terms of share, revenue and profits to continue to grow primarily on the strength of what we are – the growth that we are seeing in China.
In terms of our planning assumptions for the rest of this year, we have also raised our sites on the industry. Our original plan was somewhere in the 22% to 24% range. We have now raised that to the higher end. And we continue to see the market, a strong market. The GDP continues to tick along around 7.4%, 7.5% and we remain very favorable about the growth in China. Now, with every, I don’t have it, okay, I was going to show the risk factors, I guess to get in there, but in any event, that’s a quick snapshot of where we are in Asia-Pacific, particularly with the focus on China and our growth. And what I would like to do now is open it up to questions and answers and I will just sit here.
Question-and-Answer Session
Unidentified Analyst
Great.
David Schoch
Okay.
Unidentified Analyst
We like to save – at Morgan Stanley, we like to save the risk factors for the Q&A session. Now, so listen, thanks very much for that excellent summary of what’s going on. And I remember, I mean, one of the real dents on Ford strategy, just two or three years ago, recently, yes, three years ago was, you call yourself a global company and you have done remarkable things on global platform engineering, but you are almost nowhere in China in terms of profit contribution and now times have changed on our numbers at least I think something approaching 30% of the company’s profit is going to be coming from the Asia-Pacific and specifically, the China region on a [3%] [ph] plus?
David Schoch
When we take a look at our growth and the bubble charts that I showed you in terms of the ball charts in terms of the industry growth, when we take a look at Ford, 60% to 70% of our volume growth will probably be related to Asia-Pacific and of course the big engine there is China and India will follow, it’s just slower.
Unidentified Analyst
I am going to touch on India as well, but first thing on China, you mentioned towards the end of your presentation that looking to 2015, you felt that revenue share and profit could still rise. What about margin?
David Schoch
We just – we believe that based on what we are seeing. And I think we will talk about this more when we get to our Investor Day, which is later this month, but we are positive – on the positive side in terms of 2015.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Just a little couple of things, can you remind us like roughly local content level and I know it matters, it can vary dramatically by product line, but ballpark kind of maybe where are you today versus where you were just a couple of years ago as you are rolling out the industrial physical strategy on the ground and kind of how much more room for improvement can you make there?
David Schoch
Well, we haven’t shared that publicly, but I can tell you that over the last 3 to 5 years we have dramatically improved the local content of our products at both of our joint ventures. And where we are concentrating now is to not only localize the Tier 1 but also get into the Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers, where we still think there is additional content that we can localize in China. And I think the China supply base is maturing very well, they have accelerated. Obviously, they have had the world class suppliers come in and also the OEMs and they are helping them to grow and improve their quality.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you remind us or could you just confirm again that the massive expansion, the CapEx requirements for the Chinese business in particular is funded at the JV level, there is no, I think check writing from Dearborn to Changan Ford?
David Schoch
All of the expansion you saw there that I put on there other than India, okay, let’s just concentrate on China, is investment made through the joint ventures.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then as far as cash coming back to Dearborn from China, can you remind us the mechanism and perhaps the magnitude of flow back to the…?
David Schoch
Regarding the magnitude, we haven’t shared that, but the joint ventures we do have the dividend policy and the joint ventures paid dividends back to – back to the company.
Unidentified Analyst
How much – what will you say a typical wage inflation is right now for employees at the CAF?
David Schoch
Probably 8% to 10%. I mean it’s getting, we used to think of China as being just the low-cost manufacturing source. They are not as low cost as they were several years ago.
Unidentified Analyst
It’s more about the growth in the market is addressing the incremental consumers?
David Schoch
And there have been productivity improvements. We have seen cost reductions through productivity gains and also the localization that I have talked to you about.
Unidentified Analyst
Thinking perhaps longer term and just you as representing a business leader of a multinational in China and a participant in the auto industry which is a global industry and always will be a global industry, when would you say that we can start seeing some of that Chinese capacity playing a better part – a bigger part in the export market, when do you expect some of that to be landing on non-China shores in more significant numbers than occasionally seeing (indiscernible) on Italy?
David Schoch
Well, within Ford we have been totally dedicated on just meeting domestic demand right now. And in the near-term we continue to see us fulfilling that domestic demand before we start exports. I think last year the total China exports were about 950,000 units and most of that 300,000 and some odd plus thousand was to the Middle East and about 300,000 was…
Unidentified Analyst
The total industry?
David Schoch
Yes, total industry, and about 300,000 was I think to South America. So you do see some Chinese OEMs starting to export, but I don’t see them making a big play at it right now.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
David Schoch
And certainly Ford we are concentrating on growing our domestic business.
Unidentified Analyst
All right. I’m going to take you out of maybe your the local comfort zone just a little bit and then we are going to bring it back into Ford again. When would you expect Chinese manufacturers, be it a joint venture or a local producer, a local Chinese company, like a Shanghai Auto or Guangzhou or whatever, on North American shores manufacturing in this country and designing and engineering vehicles in the way that the Japanese and the Koreans took decades to do, give me a time when you think that’s realistic to have a meaningful share?
David Schoch
It’s a tough one to call, because I don’t think they are ready yet, but I can’t see something within the next 10 years.
Unidentified Analyst
10 years, beyond 10 years, okay.
David Schoch
That would be my personal view. Okay, my point of view and I just don’t think they are ready.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Let’s talk about some Chinese issues that might be affecting your business and the competitive environment, got to ask you about the NDRC, let’s say, fines, investigations on monopolistic antitrust practices at suppliers and manufacturers. Can you just - just throwing it out there, anything you would like to comment on in terms of what you are seeing within CAF or Jiangling or any kind of comment to contribute?
David Schoch
Well, certainly we are aware of the issues, okay. We have not at this point been approached, okay. And obviously when this started to kick around in the market we quickly went back just to double check that our policies and our practices were consistent with our global policies. And I mean you never know, but we feel that we are okay.
Unidentified Analyst
Is this a bigger shift, not asking you to say what’s happened for now, because I think if you look at the scope of the fines or if any investigation it’s on the surface looks superficial, it’s a very small percentage of imported parts or locally produced parts, very, very small percentage of total revenues that are exposed maybe on the order of 1% or 2%, I would say, BMW or Volkswagen’s business, right? Is there something bigger going on? Is this just like a shot across the bow? Is this more – is the right question not so much, is it 1.5% or 2%, but what the hell is going on? And if things are like this now, what happens when political factors could get a little more tense, it’s just the beginning of a trend is I guess what I am suggesting?
David Schoch
Well, we are certainly watching the political factors. I mean, we have all seen in the last year, year and a half, the political tension between China and Japan and what that has done to the Japanese brands in China. They have definitely been affected by this tension, this is there. And there could be some who knows what’s going to happen in terms of political tension between the United States and China. So, we are watching that very closely, but we still have a lot of confidence in where the market is headed, so…
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, let’s talk about the market and leave the politics aside, we are not going to solve those issues here, but thanks for your views. We had Autoliv presenting earlier today talking about sharing some views about the margin and they see growth slowing in China in recent months to kind of more mid single-digit from previously a double-digit pace, also rising inventory levels and even on the margin some shift towards lower mix. Again, putting politics aside, how will you describe the current operating environment in recent months, anything to be, have kind of got your attention on a cautious way?
David Schoch
A couple of thoughts. We continue to see a fairly robust China economic development, okay, somewhere in the 7.5% range, somewhere in there. And we have built our plans around that. Certainly, it is down from the pace of 10% to 11% to 12% that it was several years ago. In my mind, that was not sustainable. 7% to 7.5% in my mind is something that’s more sustainable and the government can help with that. So, while we are watching that closely, we do believe that’s a good plan. And in terms of stock build, I haven’t – I have seen some manufacturers, the best information we can, have been building stock. We are very carefully managing our capacity and our demand in our stocks. We watch that very constantly, because I don’t want to build it up and have it sit on the dealer lots, because that drives additional incentives. It drives quality issues if the vehicle sits there too long. So, we are watching that very, very closely.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thank you. I am going to get back in the politics briefly for one last point and then I am going to move to India. Rumor, perhaps unsubstantiated but love your view on this, that permits for new dealers in China have been either curtailed or put on hold pending further investigation by the NDRC for some monopolistic practices. Any kind of broad-based constriction of that growth, especially as you are on the verge of introducing Lincoln and those kinds of things, is that – this is what I am saying at any, have you heard this as well or…?
David Schoch
We have not seen any of that with either of our joint venture partners, either whether it be Changan Ford or Jiangling Motors.
Unidentified Analyst
Any competitors hearing that?
David Schoch
Not that I am aware of.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, okay, thanks. Let’s go to India. You mentioned maybe I heard this wrong you said we are returning – Ford Motor Credit returning to India, was it there before and extricated in the back, what was going on there?
David Schoch
Yes, we were there in the early to mid-2000s. And we are actually in a joint venture relationship the best I remember and it just didn’t work out and so we exited. And with the growth plans we have there and the capacity we are putting into place and we are cautiously optimistic about where India is going to go, okay, not as fast as China but where it is going, we need Ford Credit in there to be our partner not only for wholesale financing, but also retail financing for our customers.
Unidentified Analyst
So, you are going in alone, like more just pure Ford Credit without local partnerships?
David Schoch
Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Maybe just a word then if you could elaborate a bit more on the growth plans in like you are giving some growth in Asia-Pacific and then calling out China specifically in terms of production and sales, any order of magnitude or numbers in terms of growth if you were to call out India?
David Schoch
Well, India, if you take a look at the new Sanand assembly capacity and then you combine that with the Chennai assembly capacity that’s already there, we will be approaching somewhere in the 450,000 to 500,000 range. And not all that will be for the domestic market, we will have – we will be using some of that to export as I mentioned to you we are using Thailand and India as export hub.
Unidentified Analyst
Any questions from the audience?
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. What’s the Ford’s pricing policy on spare parts in China, are they really like the huge premium to prices at which you sell them in the U.S. like what VW and Daimler alleged to be doing in China right now?
David Schoch
Certainly, that’s another one of those monopolistic things that we have looked at that’s recently come to light. We have gone back and what they have done is they basically have looked at the ratio of the total of the spare parts versus the original selling price, okay. And there were several manufacturers and I am not going to get into who and what. That for example are trading or their multiple would be somewhere in the 10 to 15 range. So in other words if you bought all of the spare parts part by part and added them up they would be roughly 10 to 15 times the original price. And that’s what the government was really going after and making some example with some of the manufacturers. We have looked at ours. We believe that we remain competitive. We have not been approached at this point. And I am confident that our – again our parts pricing, because we want our customers to have a – this is not a one-time sale for us, okay. We want this cost of the whole experience, which is very, very important to us as we are building the brand. So, we are not going to jeopardize short-term gains for something that we are doing to grow the business. Does that make sense?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Actually, I am speaking from a personal experience, I have a Ford in Hong Kong and recently the air-conditioner broke down and the dealer said that I would have to pay $3000 to replace a couple of cables, so I think there is some big premium on the auto parts here?
Unidentified Analyst
That’s Hong Kong dollars, right?
Unidentified Analyst
No, $3000.
David Schoch
Okay. I don’t know obviously this is specific case, but maybe we should talk...
Unidentified Analyst
Talk to Investor Relations after the call. Thank you. As we are kind of – actually Jonathan you have got question, okay.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, thanks. Two quick questions against which brands are you most frequently cross shopped in China. And then secondly if you could comment a little bit more on the real time sort of pricing incentives environment? Thanks.
David Schoch
I think we are cross shopped amongst a lot of the major other OEMs. Certainly we are cross shopped with Toyota, with Volkswagen and General Motors. And in terms of the pricing environment, when I take a look at the long-term trend, obviously as China matures we continue to believe the long-term trend will be pricing would come down. Okay. And we have appropriately built that into our plan.
Unidentified Analyst
Sorry, please.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. Back to the slide you had on the energy efficiency or fuel efficiency, could you talk a bit generally for Ford, how Body & White is going for the F150, if you see other platforms adopting that and then when do you see and to what magnitude do you see that being adopted for China?
David Schoch
Well, the F150 launch is on track. And so, we are really, really pleased with that. When? We have no plans at this point to bring the F series into China. Obviously, we are always looking for potential opportunities, but at this point, we have made no announcements on F series coming into China.
Unidentified Analyst
(Question Inaudible)
David Schoch
Well, I think as we continue to have to meet more stringent fuel economy, one way to do that obviously is through higher technology of engines, but also in lightweight materials. So, I think you are going to continue to see Ford in terms of an innovator go to lightweight materials for our future products.
Unidentified Analyst
That’s all. In the back?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. On financing, you said that 20% of – is that Ford China or total China was financed?
David Schoch
It’s roughly about the same. Our experience right now is about 80% of the buyers come in and I have gone to dealerships over the weekend or when I visited and you literally see customers coming in with bags of money, right, but the Ford rate right now and the average are about the same, but this is something where I really believe we have an opportunity to get Ford Credit really integrated with our operations, because I think that 20% is going to grow over the next decade.
Unidentified Analyst
That 20% is that all captive or is that some portion Ford Credit, some portion partner bank?
David Schoch
Captive Ford Credit.
Unidentified Analyst
So how can you be sure that the other 80% that’s not financed isn’t some other bank lending the consumer money?
David Schoch
There could be. This is just our experience. And there are plenty of other financial institutions out there that are buying for this financing, but I am confident that – and I saw – you saw the number of dealers we had that were using Ford Credit, I am very, very confident that they are going to growing with us.
Unidentified Analyst
I mean, you have alluded some demographic stratification statistic, I don’t know, if you could again able or for the dealer should able to kind of provide sub 25-year-old customers whether that percentage is 40% or?
David Schoch
I don’t actually have the split with me, but I know that the younger generation the demographics there are more inclined to finance. So, that 20% would be something higher.
Unidentified Analyst
But I think significantly higher potentially or?
David Schoch
Just higher.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, okay.
David Schoch
Okay.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Let’s think about the NDRC in pressure, I just can’t – I think you have done a very – again setting aside Ford, you speaking as an observer and a participant in the market, are you concerned or – and again as a consumer of Chinese media as well also living with your family in China, are you concerned that there is a self-fulfilling prophecy here, tell the audience in this room how much, let’s say, broader media attention that the issue is getting, Chinese consumers are being ripped off by foreign multinationals, very big ticket items. This is serious. Is this getting a lot of media play and is it starting to affect the conversation in the dealer notwithstanding Ford, not being investigated at this point?
David Schoch
Well, I think it’s something we really needed to keep our eye on because you don’t want that reputation out there that we are gouging.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes.
David Schoch
And from a – I do see it in some other manufacturers as reported okay in the magazines or by the journalists, I don’t see that with Ford right now based on our practices, our policies and how we are doing our business there.
Unidentified Analyst
But it does affect the economic…
David Schoch
Well, sure. It has not going to affect, because the Chinese customer will put, lump everyone together and say as you have said, these non-Chinese manufacturers are coming in and gouging the discussion.
Unidentified Analyst
Some of that even the JVs are also being implicated as well. So, it’s not just…
David Schoch
Right. Well, again I believe Changan Ford and Jiangling Motors are okay.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. We have got 5 minutes left if we have some more questions for Dave. Did you have any questions for us?
David Schoch
No.
Unidentified Analyst
Couple over here, (Robbie) not you, stop (Robbie) please.
Unidentified Analyst
So, when Buick was launching product in China, they have a strong following there and they were specifically designing that product for China or at least starting out with kind of Chinese interests in mind, have you done that with Lincoln, I am kind of surprised that you are taking Lincoln there? I think kind of the jury is still out with Lincoln domestically and I just don’t remember reading anything about Lincoln being kind of designed with the China market in mind, what kind of gives you the confidence that Lincoln can be successful there?
David Schoch
Well, a couple of thoughts. One, our product development process and our market research process both Ford and Lincoln have moved way upstream and we are doing a lot more market research than we have ever done before in China, so we can see that into the product development system. So some of the vehicles that you see coming through now don’t quite have all across the Chinese customer wants, but the next generation, the following mid-cycle actions and the future products will certainly have Chinese market wants baked into it. China or Lincoln has a very, very strong brand image in China even though we officially haven’t sold a vehicle there since around 1940s, but it is seen as very presidential, very prestigious has a very, very good brand reputation. We have gotten what I would view to be of the – we have 35 dealers now that have signed up and these are premier dealers. They already have other premium brands the Audis and the Mercedes and the BMWs and the fact that they are willing to invest gives me confidence that they also see a lot of opportunity in the Lincoln brand. So, we have got a lot of confidence, but then when you see the dealers and the amount of money they are putting into their dealerships, it gives me additional confidence that we have got something that will resonate with our customers there.

Just to kind of echo I think as (John Simmons) asked a question about conquest for Ford brand in China, obviously you haven’t launched Lincoln yet, but in your market planning and research, can you tell us who you would expect to be conquesting from besides just any specific name besides needing it to be more German vis-à-vis Buick or I mean if you ask I would say Buick is kind of in the sites, is that fair or is that unfair?
