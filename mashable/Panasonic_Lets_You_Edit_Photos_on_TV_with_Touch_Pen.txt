Panasonic Lets You Edit Photos on TV with Touch Pen
LAS VEGAS — Panasonic today showed off a new vision of the second screen, introducing new ways your phone or tablet can interact with what you're watching on TV. 
Part of the vision: a new accessory called the Touch Pen that lets you edit photos right on the screen, then immediately push them to a mobile device.
Last year Panasonic released Swipe and Share, a way to relay content from smartphone to TV and back; now it's launching version 2.0 of that software. Whereas before you could send content like a photo to your TV via a smartphone or tablet app, now you can interact with that content via the TV.
In the case of photos, you can actually edit them — which is where the Touch Pen comes in. Users can write notes or draw pictures on the screen with the Pen, assisted by a pull-down menu that appears when the pen touches the TV. Those edited pictures can then be pulled back down to any mobile device.
In addition Swipe and Share 2.0, Panasonic is enhancing its second-screen experience through partnerships with HSN, which has developed a app called Shop by Remote, which lets users get detailed product information and read customer reviews of whatever they're checking out on the channel.
Starting in the spring, Panasonic's 2013 smart TVs will also integrate YouTube's new second-screen experience, which lets you queue up YouTube videos for watching on TV as well as control the playback, all from your phone.
Finally, Panasonic has completely revamped the home screen of its smart TVs, putting all the different kinds of content (live TV, on-demand video, apps, etc.) all in one place. The interface features multiple user profiles, and it'll work with the TV's front-facing camera to recognize who's watching and call up their preferences.
How do you like Panasonic's new smart TV tricks and the Touch Pen: great stuff or meh? Let us know in the comments.
