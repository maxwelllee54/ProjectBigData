Intellect Motion Turns Gameplay Into Hardcore Exercise

LAS VEGAS — No matter what you think, video gaming is not exercise. It's sitting on your butt, twitching your fingers over a dozen multi-colored buttons. You rarely break a sweat. I can tell you though, from personal experience, that if you ever get to try Intellect Motion, you will sweat and bounce around like never before.
Intellect Motion's prototype system, on display here at CES 2013, consists of a steel frame, bungee cords, a computer, some web cams and wearable sensors to put your game-playing butt to work. To test it, I had the Intellect Motion team strap me in (very tightly, I might add), and connect all the bungee cords to me (via the harness). Those cords keep you propped up, but also provide tension that you have to work against.
Once they powered up the game (any open-sourced one running on a PC should work), I had to move my body to run forward and twist to turn from side to side. This is more strenuous than it sounds. That's why they call it "Play for Health."
At $10,000, the system is not cheap. However, Intellect Motion execs told me the product — which is still in the design and funding phase — is intended for pro gaming centers and child care. Check out the video to watch the system — and me — in action.
