Sharp Unveils Next-Gen IGZO Displays
LAS VEGAS â€” The U.S. is going to get its first taste of Sharp Electonics's IGZO display technology. The tech giant announced today at CES 2013 that it's bringing next-gen LED displays to the American market in 2013.
IGZO, which stands for Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide, is actually a transparent, compound semi-conductor that Sharp says can replace the standard amorphous silicon material used for the active layer in thin-film transistors (TFTs) LED displays.
The new display technology, which was introduced in Japan last year (in smartphones), offers, according to Sharp, of number of benefits over traditional LCD displays:
It can support super-high resolutions. At CES, Sharp is demonstrating a new 32-inch 3,840 x 2,160 pixels (roughly 4x by 2x standard HD) touch-screen business monitor.
The ultra-low-power display technology can actually maintain a screen image after it's been powered down. Sharp did not state how long the image would last.
The new display technology also, Sharp says, lowers screen noise/interference introduced by touch technology.

To create the finished displays, which for now run from 4-to-32 inches diagonally, Sharp partnered with Corning Glass. The final LED business displays are 35mm thick. Sharp says that makes them the thinnest "in their class."
IGZO monitors, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. Sharp executives anticipate IGZO will end up in everything from phones to countertops. You can get a glimpse of those future applications in the video below.
