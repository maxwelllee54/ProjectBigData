Julian Mitchell
Thank you very much, everyone for coming and particularly Lorenzo Simonelli, President of GE Oil & Gas. Lorenzo will talk around 15 minutes and then we'll have questions.
Lorenzo Simonelli
Julian, thank you. Good afternoon to everybody and first of all, let me thank Credit Suisse also for setting up this conference. And it's my opportunity to really tell you a little bit about GE Oil & Gas. And I think you all don't need an introduction into the downcycle that the oil and gas industry is facing, but you may need a little bit of learning as to how GE is really coming through this cycle and going to be much stronger and the actions that we are taking.
And when you look at the simplest level, it's really because we are a unique proposition within the industry. For those of you that don't know GE Oil & Gas, we've grown up over the course of the last 20 years through multiple acquisitions and I'll get into some of those acquisitions, but what it enables us to do is really be a full stream provider. Now, that's not at a time you're going to find in the industry, it's the time that we've come up with, but really to characterize the way in which we offer both products and services of high technical content across the full value stream of the oil and gas industry.
And so a customer is able to look at us as being in every part of their value chain. It’d be from the upstream perspective and making sure that we provide the extraction at the lowest possible cost to the downstream, making sure that the refineries and the petrochemicals keep on running and then as you look at the midstream, through the pipelines, the LNG terminals, we’re very strong when it comes to the rotating equipment and the liquefaction and compression. So as you look at GE Oil & Gas, think of us as being a proposition to the industry across the value chain.
And as you look at the industry, you know the cycle we’re going through at the moment. I'm not going to look at the aspects of the numbers here. You can see them. There is very much though a strong view that the macro trend is intact. So we don't really focus on the oil price at GE Oil & Gas. We focus on the long-term elements of this industry and the fundamentals and when you look at the fundamentals, growing population means growing need for energy, increasing consumption of electricity and at the end, the resources need to be extracted.
So when you look at the long-term as we come through this downcycle, there is clearly pressure in the short-term and we’re going through a difficult period that we are needing to navigate. We feel good about oil and gas continuing to increase in demand. As you look at the subsea and offshore, they remain an element of production and providing supply to be able to meet the demand and then on conventional, the theme that's really grown here in North America, continuing to be the swing aspect and coming back strong as you see the uptick coming through.
So no different than what you'll see from the industry projections and that's what we look at, we don't try and guestimate and we stay really focused on the execution at hand within our business. And this is our business. So as you look at 2014, you've got $19 billion of revenue, you've got 40,000 employees and as I mentioned before, think of us as being the provider across the value chain. So when you look at the upstream, you’ve got the aspect of drilling, you've got the deepwater, trees, the manifolds. Then as you look onshore, you've got the wellheads, the artificial lifting, then you move into the midstream, which is the turbomachinery solutions, this is both equipment and services of rotating equipment, compression, liquefaction out of Florence, Italy, again a very strong franchise that we acquired back in 1994, 95.
And then you go to the downstream arena with the refineries, petrochemicals. This is where also recent acquisition last year of the reciprocating compressors of Cameron fits in, and then we've got the measurement and controls. So our portfolio is very diversified. That enables us to navigate through the downcycle. So we’re not just focused on one area and we also have the ability of blending equipment and services from a high technical content. So we've got a good backlog going into a downcycle that we’re able to work off and also have a long stream of service contracts that I'll share with you.
One of the big focuses though has been cost out, that's an industry wide phenomena. We've held to the cost out projections that we gave last year at our outlook meeting and we’re on track to have an accumulated $1 billion of cost out over the course of 2015 and 2016 and we’ll adjust that as we need to from a standpoint of taking up with the projects we have in our pipeline, if we see volatility continuing or we see continued pressure. But as you look at the cost out, we’re on track for 600 million this year and then 400 million coming through next year as well.
And it really comes from three areas. And these are three areas that are important to break down. The first is product standardization, making sure that we’re taking material cost out, design cost out, providing standard products to our customers. This is a big theme in relation to also helping the project execution and cost for our customers. And these are normally projects that we go into from an engineering perspective, product management, and they take between 18 months to 3 years from a launch perspective. We started this initiative back in the end of 2013, beginning of 2014, as you saw the project escalation of cost.
The second, your infrastructure. Being able to consolidate sites, being able to drive productivity in our own operations. At GE, we've got a big focus on digital and digitally internally also between our manufacturing facilities. So a digital thread of combining, consolidating ERPs, taking out manual intervention and having it seamlessly flow through our ERP systems. Then when we look at consolidation, structural costs, we've taken over 50 facilities out of our footprint and we’re continuing to look at other opportunities as we consolidate some of our manufacturing and service operations that we have around the globe.
The third is your traditional blocking and tackling. So as you think about discretionary cost coming out, that's your travel and living, that's your purchase services and that's something that we continue doing and monitoring on an ongoing basis. The first two though, the product cost out and the infrastructure and services, this is where the pipeline of opportunities continues beyond the billion, as we look at the environment we continue to assess what needs to be done.
A huge benefit of GE Oil & Gas is that we’re part of GE and I can't stress this enough. We’re able to take and package equipment and great capabilities from our other businesses. You look at GE Aviation providing the aero derivative, you look at a project such as subsea deepwater, we’re able to take the electric motor from our energy management business, we’re able to look at the aspect of gas turbines from power and water. On the aviation side, in relation to aero derivatives; you look at the healthcare business, providing us the diagnostics.
This is the power of GE being one, GE Oil & Gas packages a lot of the capabilities that come from the other businesses in conjunction with the capabilities we have from an equipment and services perspective within GE and we work closely with our global research centers. I don't think there is any other company within the industry that can again provide this capability all in one area, and that's what we really call the GE store, and it's a great strength that we have to pull on from the rest of the businesses.
We also focus on NPIs, new product introductions and this is an area that we haven't stopped investing into. If you look at the first area of driving cost out, it's around making sure that product costs are reduced, that you have more standardized products such as DVXT trees, but also that you have new offerings to your customers for the future of the industry and in each of the areas of our portfolio, we’re investing and continuing to invest in new products, over 100 launches in 2015 and as you look at our focus on engineering, we've taken the spend up. And we've got a large portion of that spend focused on cost out opportunities and also new technology breakthroughs.
I’ll just mention a couple, 20 kpsi on our drilling and subsea area. Again, we know the Gulf of Mexico is going to need 20 kpsi from a blowout prevent perspective, we are going to be there. As you look at the turbomachinery, LMS6000-PF+, it's again a new opportunity to provide incremental efficiency from the aeroderivative family and it goes on down the line with the measurement controls business and also the downstream, focusing on new product introductions and cost out opportunities and this is a great benefit of also being part of GE, we leverage the global technology census that we have in place.
Here is a specific example, what does it mean? This is a product within our family of rotating equipment and as you look at this new gas turbine, it puts us into the 16 megawatt space. This was introduced following a FastWorks process. What that means is quick deployment and prototyping much faster than our previous NPI releases. So you can actually see that we were able to bring this from concept to first test in 30 months. Traditionally, that would have taken 6 years. This is also availability and efficiency for the customer that is not in the marketplace today, so this is best-in-class and we think this is going to be a great product as we go forward and it's just an example to share with you on how we focus on new technology, new introductions, as the mantra staying competitive and being close to our customers.
The other benefit we have and I mentioned this previously is services. We have a great portfolio from a service backlog perspective, not just the equipment backlog we have, but you think about our services, these are 20-year annuities that we have within our LNG space. We also have within our subsea space. So as you see all of this volatility in the marketplace happening on orders today, we’re able to balance out that outlook because we have this annuity of services and you can see, we've got a split of about 50-50 between the equipment and services, but our services goes across each of our product lines.
And I'm going to share with you some of the ways in which we’re adding to our services capability and also the profitability through digitization. But here is an example on LNG. So what happens is you get an initial contract and that's traditionally CapEx, but after that 2 to 3 years of actually providing the equipment, you then go into the aspect of servicing the equipment for 20 years. If you think about 35 operating LNG plants, about 95% of them have GE equipment, 94% of those actually have long-term service contracts.
And we are then able to add incremental capability into those contracts. New solutions such as Reliability Max, which provide uptime and 99% availability to these customers. Getting more output from an LNG perspective is money in our customer's pocket. So that's why we’re able to provide these incremental offerings as we go forward and we also focus on reduction on outages and the big focus is really reducing any unplanned downtime and this is an offering that we continue to go and maximize as we go out into the marketplace, it's not just in the LNG space, but it's also in the subsea space.
Again, you look at this example from Statoil. This is a life of field concept, so you have the initial project, which again is a CapEx based, but then you have the OpEx that goes for another 20, 25 years. That OpEx is anywhere from 2.5 times to 10 times the initial CapEx and what we do is we enter into service arrangements where we upgrade, we provide new capabilities, we retrofit all of the equipment that's there and this is a great addition to the production and also the availability and reliability of the equipment we've put in there during the CapEx phase.
So this is how we also differentiate ourselves in the industry as we are there for the long-term with these offerings. And the big area of focus at the moment, you may have heard the GE launch, GE Digital. Well, GE Digital is the industrial Internet. It is providing a product called Predix that is essentially the IOS of the industrial fair. That IOS is then clever augmented with applications that we build for our customers and this provides diagnostics, data monitoring, predictive analysis that we’re able to offer to our customers and it's on an open architecture, which is again different from many others, which allows other people to build on to it as well.
But there are three examples I wanted to share with you that really sort of show and tell the power of this and why we are being successful. Field Vantage, a product that we go and provide with the rod pumps that we have in place, in Kuwait at the moment, there are 200 wells that are providing Field Vantage an opportunity to maximize the output of those wells, increasing production from 2% to 5% per well. Again that is benefit to the customer as is just the additional equipment. They still need the equipment, but then we supplement that equipment with this capability to enhance the production.
Intelligent Pipelines, being able to monitor and diagnose what's happening across your pipeline network. With Columbia Pipeline, we have Intelligent Pipelines being installed to give them visibility to 15,000 kilometers of pipeline, again reducing the cost of needing to go out there and inspect.
And finally, Unified Operations; taking a facility, monitoring it and then optimizing it. We have an amazing install base. The power of what we have is data from lots of years of monitoring equipment around the globe. We are now able to take that and provide as a service to our customers to optimize their facilities, because we have that inherent knowledge on the equipment and how the equipment interrelates and it’s not just our equipment, it can also be applied to third party equipments. So this is a big opportunity as we go forward and you’ve heard a lot being said by also our Chairman Jeff Immelt on digital and wave of the future. And every industrial company needs to be a software company and at GE Oil & Gas we are increasing our offerings as we go forward to really provide benefits to our customers.
Last but not least, we are executing. If you look at the performance third quarter year-to-date, we are on track for what we said or better than what we provided at the outlook meeting last year and in fact if you look at the third quarter year-to-date, we are actually positive on an organic basis. So through the cost out, we are managing the down cycle. I am not here to tell you that it’s not a difficult industry, it’s challenging, but we know what we are facing into, so we are taking the actions that are necessary from a cost out perspective.
We are also staying nimble, so working with our customers on ways in which we can help them further through product standardization, through incremental offerings of service, software and we are continuing to invest as we go through this down cycle. So that’s the mantra as we go forward. We’ve already given an indication that next year is down 10% to 15%. We’ve taken a balanced outlook on the year, we speak to our customers on a regular basis and again, we are continuing to focus on the cost out, but reinvesting in the value-added future of this business. It's a great portfolio and also the macro aspect looks positive and we’ve got to navigate through this down cycle with flexibility.
So thank you very much.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Julian Mitchell
Thanks, Lorenzo. Let me firstly just - the overall 10% to 15% decline next year, how do you see that differing across the different sub-segments; subsea, turbo machinery, measurement control, who is at the lower end of that drop, who could be flat or even grow?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So, Julian, I think if you look at the benefit of GE Oil and Gas, and I mentioned at the outset as we’ve got a great franchise of a portfolio that cuts across the whole value chain of the oil and gas industry and in fact our measurement control business also sells into the industrial, sells into the aviation, so we’ve got a balancing factor. If you look at some of the segments, it would be fair to say that the pressure point has been on the onshore side, the surface, which has seen a steep decline this year just given the level of activity in North America.
As we look into next year, the deepwater projects and also the drilling activity, blowout preventers is slow based on the projects that are pushed out. What we are looking at, though, is really the rotating equipment, CMS, the downstream and the measurement control is continuing to be solid. And we’ve got a good strong backlog as well as then the services aspect that we have on these arenas that help us to predict that. So that's sort of the lay of the land as we go forward.
Julian Mitchell
And if you look at pricing in the orders that you report each quarter, maybe it’s got a little bit worse in Q3, but not a big step down. House has pricing developed as you’ve gone I guess through the last six months in particular?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So it's a competitive industry out there and we’ve got to be competitive, so clearly there is pricing pressure in each of the contracts we go after. We’ve got the benefit of technology differentiation and also strong customer relationships and incumbency in some cases that helps us. We’ve got to retain competitiveness. So we're monitoring on an ongoing basis and then focusing on cost out, but we will do what we need to and the intent is here to protect price erosion, but at the same time, we are realistic that within an industry there is going to be price competition.
Julian Mitchell
And in which areas, if I look across the business as a whole, certainly on the revenue line, you seem to be taking share, which areas you think the share gains are most pronounced?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So, again, we don't divulge share numbers across the various segments. What I will tell you is, we’ve got some very strong technology introductions and also some strong positions. When you look at the LNG space and you look at the historic strong position that we’ve had, we’ve retained that. As you look at also the new introductions we've made within the surface business, even though there is a decline in the industry, I think you are seeing improvement in operations and also the NPIs have allowed us to gain some position there. And on the subsea arena, we’ve gained the large contracts at the beginning of the year in Ghana, which obviously helped us from a perspective of share in the industry which is down, but that helped us as well. And measurement and controls is pretty much in line with where it has been.
Julian Mitchell
And if you look at the breadth of the portfolio, it is quite unique. How interested is GE in expanding further to the segments you have already within oil and gas?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Great question. I think again if you look at the portfolio that we have and what we've assembled over the course of the last 20 years, we have an amazing portfolio offering to our customers. So there's nothing that you say we need to be able to go out to our customers. At the same time, if there is opportunities that come about to tuck something in and is opportunistic, we will take a look at it. We did close the transaction just recently in Norway through our subsea space and this is also our belief in the long term that subsea comes back and on the life of field concept with the IWOCS, we made a small investment in some technology on the onshore side with more launches in Canada. So we remain opportunistic as things come up, but we are very happy also with the offering that we have in our customers. We see a lot of benefit from it.
Julian Mitchell
And if we look at sort of the corporate-wide communication around M&A, maybe it sounds a little bit more financially disciplined today perhaps in terms of weighing up M&A dollars versus share buyback, how do you see valuations, seller expectations within the oil and gas industry today?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So, look, I think the valuations are market-driven and you can look at the comps externally. From a capital allocation perspective, I run an operating division within GE and clearly I have got opportunities that we look at and then we take up to Jeff and we have a discussion around what’s from best from a capital allocation of the company and that decision is made really holistically across the business. So we are all competing at the same time for what the best returns are. And as we see opportunities that have good returns, we will take them up to Jeff and we will have a balanced discussion.
Julian Mitchell
And before I guess the downturn recently, there was the aspiration of maybe high teens EBIT margin at some point, where are we - whenever the top line stabilizes, when you look at the collection of businesses you have, the progress on cost cutting this year, record margins end up medium term?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So, Julian, this is something that we’ve always continued to look at and as we come out of the downturn, our goal of continuing to accrete margin and getting the GE level hasn't changed and we think that the actions we've taken will help us as the market starts to recover and we still see that goal in sights and being able to get up to the high teens level of margin rates.
Julian Mitchell
And the billion dollar of cost out, I think that was sort of communicated near at the beginning of this year, middle of this year. Demand has stayed very soft since then. So at what point do we see an augmentation to that program?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So we stay very flexible and I think I mentioned the aspect of we’ve got $1 billion of which $600 million comes through this year, $400 million comes through next year and then we’ve got really three initiatives that drive the pipeline. So we’ve got a pipeline of projects that go and extend beyond that and depending on what we see from an environment perspective, you will start to see those come through. You can imagine what they are in particular on the product cost out, the new launches that we are making that will be at a better rate and a better return from a cost perspective, less cost content as you look at opportunities around facility consolidation and restructurings that we need to further have an opportunity on. And then on the discretionary side, we will keep on doing what we need to, but I'd say that the real opportunity continues to be on the product redesign standardization and then some of the consolidation and simplification that we have at a company level through ERPs and also digital thread. And we just have a pipeline of projects which we will put into the funnel as we need to.
Julian Mitchell
And firm-wide I guess there is a 50 basis points per year gross margin expansion target, I guess oil and gas has very unique top line fundamentals right now, but looking beyond next year should we think oil and gas can exceed the corporate average on gross margin in terms of annual expansion?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Okay, I think, again, we will be our net contributor to the margin accretion and 50 bps that you mentioned as we come out of the down cycle. What we’ve been able to do this year on an organic basis is also be accretive on the margins which is what we set out to do. We’ve got to see as we continue going into 2016 how the environment changes. We’ve given a balanced outlook relative to the 10 to 15, but we feel that as we come through an up-cycle, we will be a net contributor on the 50 points, 50 bps.
Julian Mitchell
And how significant is the change in mix? I think GE has been quite reticent about giving understandably the sort of margin color on sub-segments within oil and gas in terms of which pieces are higher versus lower margin. I guess clearly that will determine the margin move next year quite a lot. So is there any detail you can give on how wide the profit margin ranges across the different businesses inside the segment?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Look, I'll give you a spectrum and it won’t be specific to numbers, but you can look at it versus the average that we have and get a sense. If you think about measurement and controls, the type of products and services that we are offering, they would be at a higher margin rate and that would be the traditional case as well. You’ve got a strong services franchise within the rotating equipment side and the LNG liquefaction. So we are able to make sure that that remains higher than the average that we have and then downstream is pretty much in line. We are taking a lot of cost out of the products there and the pressure point is going to be as you look at surface business and also on the subsea side, just given the industry decline that we’ve seem, but again you balance it out at a portfolio level. But that sort of gives you an indication of it.
Julian Mitchell
And as you said, GE has made very good progress this year on cost reduction. When you took over running the business, what were some of the biggest things I guess haven’t been put in place on the margin side, or was it just there were so many acquisitions in a short space of time, there wasn’t the bandwidth initially to integrate them.
Lorenzo Simonelli
I think you had a couple of things that were taking place and all of the foundations were there and the building blocks were starting to get together. But you had an industry that was on fire. You had number of projects that people were trying to run after and execute. To a certain degree, the slowdown has also given opportunity to let’s get the house in order and focus on operational execution, focus on the cost points of our products, the lean, the cycle time for our products and also make sure that we are executing for customer expectations. So the new products that we are introducing, I mentioned DVXT trees, but you look at that from a cycle time perspective, people were waiting three years for a tree and now you’re going out there and you’re saying, I will give you a tree in anywhere between 12 to 16 months, that’s a huge reduction and also provides a certainty to the customer base.
The other element is being able to just consolidate the buy and supplier rationalization. When you go to an industry that is frenetic, you’re out there multiple suppliers all at once. We’ve had an opportunity to rationalize our supply base, focus on the cost outpace there. So I think, again we - the GE operational discipline is something that we are incorporating into the acquisitions and you’re starting to see it take shape. There is more that we are going to do as we go into ‘16, but the foundation was there and we are building on it.
Julian Mitchell
I don’t know if there are any questions in audience, if not I guess one from me would be managing through the downturn is obviously quite difficult. It’s a good time as well though to pick up pace that may get cheaper. So is there any limit in terms of size when you think about the leadership within oil and gas to manage cost reduction on the core and integrate a new asset simultaneously?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Julian, that’s - one of my key roles is to make sure that we’ve got the right talent in the business and that we are able to take opportunities as they come about. We’ve been very fortunate that we brought in a lot of good talent, and actually during the industry downturn, it’s been an opportunity for us to go out and recruit. So we have balanced out the aspect of restructuring with also the element of bringing in talent and upgrading our team, bringing in domain expertise. So I feel comfortable that we are in a good place with the leadership team and also with taking advantage of potential opportunities if they are appropriate.
Rick Hightower
Rick Hightower, Credit Suisse. I wondered if you could speak to the - assuming the landscape of M&A that’s currently proposed closes out as planned, where do you view your competitive positioning over the course of the next couple of years.
Lorenzo Simonelli
I apologize. I couldn’t hear the second part of that question, M&A activity -
Rick Hightower
Assuming the M&A activity that’s currently announced does close out as planned, how do you view your competitive positioning going forward?
Lorenzo Simonelli
I am not sure when you are referring to M&A activity is announced.
Rick Hightower
The current M&A proposals that have announced in the industry that are currently pending, assuming they close, what do you view your competitive positioning going forward?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Thank you. So, look, I look at our competitive positioning in the industry very solid. There is always going to be competition. As you look at Schlumberger and Cameron coming together, the potential of Halliburton and Baker Hughes coming together, I think actually Schlum and Cameron have closed, we have got a great portfolio, we are very strong in the positions that we have and we compete very effectively on the technology and differentiate on services. So I think it’s natural in an industry that you’re going to have competition. We focus on the technology advancements and also the customer closeness and so we feel good about the position.
Unidentified Analyst
The down 10% to 15% for ‘16, could you maybe give some color on what that assumes for measurement and control and subsea or like different segments of the business.
Lorenzo Simonelli
Yes, and the question for those that didn’t hear, the down 10% to 15% for 2016, can we get some plan for the outlook by segment, and I think I sort of gave reference to it already. When you look at the businesses that are under pressure just given where the industry is, you look at the subsea and the drilling activity that hasn’t seen a large order base for this year outside of the large deal that we took, you’re going to see that pressured, and so we have already taken that into account from a restructuring perspective and also outlook going into ‘16. When you look at the downstream and measurement and controls, we see them very much being intact. And on the rotating equipment, turbomachinery business, again, we have got a solid position within the industry and also good project backlog and the services stream that helps us and the services side onshore that continues to be pressured with the industry. That’s not a delay at the land, as you look our portfolio. But we’ve balanced that out with 10% to 15% down in ‘16.
Unidentified Analyst
[indiscernible]
Lorenzo Simonelli
I mean, again, subsea drilling we don’t report on a segment level, but the subsea drilling business you would anticipate that being down further. You would anticipate the onshore surface side being down, but the pace at which is found is less than continuing to see positive momentum in other areas.
Unidentified Analyst
When you think the next cycle and the beginning, you have said that to be a function of supply or demand?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Sorry, when I say what?
Unidentified Analyst
The beginning of the next cycle, what will be that, supply or demand?
Lorenzo Simonelli
So, we don’t - and one thing that’s important, we never came into this industry because of the aspects of oil price and we came into it because from a macro trend perspective, there is going to be an increasing need for these resources, there is an increasing need for technology, because they are in harsher, more difficult places and there is going to be more regulation as well. Those three fundamentals actually associate very well with the GE business. And if you think about our aviation business, power water business, that similar characteristics when you look at those and so we benefit a lot from being able to go into the GE store. As you think about cycle recovery, the expectation is from an industry standpoint that its’ going to be the demand and supply, the buffer that’s in supply will be constrained given the less CapEx that’s been spent in the last few years.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst
One point I think Lorenzo on sort of OE versus off the market, your roll segment transportation has a small mining business and people have been trying to call it a trough on mining aftermarket for about five years. How do you see oil and gas service being different from mining service in the sense of how far do you think you are from that trough in oil and gas service? And again, within the 10% to 15% drop next year, OE versus aftermarket, any color?
Lorenzo Simonelli
We feel good about our services business and also the aftermarket relative where we are, the aspect of shutting something off that’s taken very lightly. It’s not like mining where you have a mining truck that you can decide to either turn on or turn off. We are talking about large scale facilities of LNG, we are talking about offshore platforms, we are talking about large investments that have taken place over the multiple years. And so the services that we have in place, we are going to continue to help our customers from a productivity perspective and helping their cost of production, so that they remain in shape and continue to produce. And with that, we feel good about the services and the aftermarket continuing to be there.
Julian Mitchell
So services next year down only single-digits or something?
Lorenzo Simonelli
Yeah, and we haven’t broken it out yet. But again, the expectation is with the services portfolio that we have, we will continue to execute on our long-term contracts and let’s not forget the aspect of digital and the opportunities we have of incorporating digital into those elements as well and a new offering for our customers. And when we can take up the number of barrels of oil produced or we can take up the LNG that’s produced at a site, that is tremendous value. 1% increase, if you look at you’re able to take up today this - a well will retrieve about 35%. If you are able to increase that by 1%, you’re talking significant barrels of oil production.
Unidentified Analyst
Lorenzo, you’ve done a great job managing margins in its downturn. On the down 10% to 15% revenues I think you said operating profit down 10% to 15% as well. Let’s just say the industry for argument sake was worse than expected and maybe that’s not ‘16, maybe it’s ‘17 and you saw another drawdown, 20% to 25%. I think Julian asked the question earlier. It seems like there is upside to your $1 billion of cost out potential. So is the goal that just keep margins flat even as we go down the slope the decline in the end-market.
Lorenzo Simonelli
First of all, thanks for your comment on the managing of 15. Our goal is to execute with excellence. And so as you look at the profile of down 10% to 15%, our goal is to continue to stay within that band and also to continue the cost out as necessary and we have to manage margins accordingly. Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst
Your projection of down 10% to 15% is predicated on what oil price for next year?
Lorenzo Simonelli
I don’t tend to look at the oil price on a daily basis. What we have as assumed is really what our business profile is and what our customers are telling us. So in relation to the projects that are going to go, in relation for the investments that they are going to make and also the activity that we have in backlog and also the service franchise that we have. So that’s really what we are basing it on. And then as you look at from an oil perspective, we look at the forward curves like everybody does.

And if you see oil - if you see the price stay low for a long time, I guess how important would it be for you to shift your portfolio within oil and gas? Because I think it was - I guess, it was - a lot of it was assembled recently at a fairly high oil price time. So if we see oil stay low for long time, do you then say okay, we need to start to grow measurement and control share of the business much more significantly.

So Julian, we like to grow each of our businesses and we have a strategy for each of them. I think you have got to dislocate the aspect of pricing of oil and then from a business perspective. This business is predicated on the aspect of increasing the actual supply of the resources that are going to be necessary for the increasing population. So put aside the price of oil for a second and look at the level of activity that’s going to have to be undertaken to be able to achieve that and that means, we’ve got to focus on productivity, it means, we got to focus on delivering to our customers a better cost position, but that doesn’t mean potentially the activity goes down. So we may still be in a price of oil that’s different than we anticipate, but the activity would become more productive and so projects going forward.

Great, I think that’s all we have time for. Thank you very much.
