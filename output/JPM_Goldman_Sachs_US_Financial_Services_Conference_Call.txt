Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Richard Ramsden
Sorry, for those of you that can’t get into the room, there is an overflow room next door. Thanks. So up next – okay. So up next, we are delighted to have Jamie Dimon. Jamie is now in his 10th year as CEO and Chairman of JPMorgan. Since he has joined, the market cap has doubled. We really do appreciate you coming here. There is obviously a great deal to talk about. I think since you last spoke publicly, we have obviously had the results of the election. So, perhaps we can start with a discussion around that. So just broadly, since November 7, how has your thought process changed about the economic outlook about the banking industry and more specifically, JPMorgan?
Jamie Dimon
Well, first of all, welcome, everybody. Happy to be here. And obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well since the election and I think it’s based upon the hope. The hope is accurate that the Trump administration will be very good for kind of unleashed business per se and maybe improve the GDP and allow banks to do their lending and the banks will benefit a little bit both from higher rates and higher economic activity and possibly some reduced regulation. So, hopefully that will turn out to be true.
Richard Ramsden
I mean, more specifically, as you think about the budgeting process for JPMorgan for 2017 today relative to what you were thinking about on November 7, how has that changed?
Jamie Dimon
Zero. I mean, that was going to happen in the budgeting processes when we re-upped the budget in December and January for the new curve in, which will help a little bit, obviously, but in terms of bankers, branches, investments, Chase Pay, marketing, virtually, zero, have almost no effect, whatsoever.
Richard Ramsden
So at this stage, you are not building in any faster economic growth translating in faster land growth?
Jamie Dimon
But even if we did, it’s just an estimate that doesn’t affect our plan as this will change a little bit what the outcome might be, but it’s not going to change our actual expansion plan as our investment, our businesses, our technology plans, etcetera.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So, regulation is obviously getting lower focus. The Treasury Secretary elect has said that Dodd-Frank is too complicated and the new administration wants to script back some parts of Dodd-Frank that are impacting bank lending. If they were to ask you what changes you think make sense to change from a regulatory perspective, what would they be?
Jamie Dimon
Good. Look, we passed Dodd-Frank a 100% partisan. There is no bipartisan support. And when that happened way back when, I think we subjected our country to re-litigating this issue and relegislating this issue until it’s done bipartisan. And so we are not asking for wholesale on Dodd-Frank, but it’s always been a rational thing, always. It’s always been a rational to look at major legislation and open it up, take a look at it, recalibrate it, change it a little bit and that was the expectation when Dodd-Frank was passed even by many of the democrats told me that they were expecting that to take place. And so, it is a completely rational thing to do. It needs to be done in a bipartisan way. So, we don’t have to re-litigate and re-legislate it again. I mean, you have got to kind of make it done with and I can give you a whole bunch of things in there that you can debate about, you know what they are. I don’t have to make the long list of them, but it’s – and also the things it gave a lot of room to regulators to do what they want to do, I think that should be cutback a little bit. It should be more perspective and exact what they are to accomplish, why they are trying to accomplish it. Legislation is meant to do certain things. Regulation meant to do another. This kind of pushed what I would say lot of legislative ability on to the regulators and hopefully that will change a little bit.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So, they have also talked about the Volcker Rule being needed to be revisited. Do you think changing the Volcker Rule would enhance market liquidity? And do you think it would have a material impact on the funding cost if there was a changeup?
Jamie Dimon
So, the Volcker Rule, someone once said that any part of Dodd-Frank that was named after a Senator with a bad parch and Barney Frank said that at one point in time, because he was against most of the amendments. And so Volcker, split apart, two parts of Volcker. One part is should investment banks do proprietary trading and put that aside and say, no, or investment hedge funds you put aside and say, no, but regular market making, you did need Volcker at all. Capital liquidity reporting requirements were sufficient to make sure that banks were probably taking risks and not excessive risk in market-making. And so will it be changed? I don’t know. I mean, we have all implemented it. We were all doing extensive reporting around it. If you talk to the traders on the floor, it’s affecting them a little bit, how they are willing to take risk or not take risk. And I remind people even in the government, you want active market-making. You have got active market-making on lumbar, rebar, chicken, pork, cotton you need it in financial instruments, not different. And so making sure it’s done safely is one thing. And so yes, if Volcker is opened up for changes or something like that, it will probably make it easier to make markets, it will probably make liquidity a little bit better in some of those markets and some of that will benefit both investors and issuers, but it’s one of the things that’s hard to see, because you see the spreads bounce around all the time, but I do think, little more liquidity will be good. I think other things affect liquidity in the marketplace like how you look at liquidity ratios, how you allocate capital against deposit the fed or against holding federal debt. Those things are probably the things that are affecting swap spreads, which are still negative and repo rates and stuff like that. So there you have also get a bang for the buck in terms of cheaper finding cost for most people.
Richard Ramsden
I mean, you are obviously one of the world’s largest market-makers. So, do you think a repeal of the Volcker Rule of a material change would impact JPMorgan?
Jamie Dimon
Not materially, but I think you will see it in the marketplace with slightly more liquidity. It was not going to change our life. If you have a Volcker Rule, we don’t have a Volcker Rule. I just – I don’t think the Volcker Rule should be put in place with that RE, called RENT-D, which is the estimate of future business should be a punitive type thing. I mean I would just get rid of that calculation. It’s a waste of time.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So, corporate tax reform is the other thing that’s obviously very high on the agenda. When you think about what that means for both JPMorgan, but also for your client base, what are your thoughts?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. We have needed corporate tax reform for a long time, okay. We have the highest both statutory rate and effective rate of all the developed nations in the planet. We are driving capital overseas. And I have always said I have been consistent we are going to drive capital overseas and the only question is when we can stop the damage. And some of that damage is permanent. People have bought companies overseas. They built plants overseas. They have built research centers overseas. Corporate America is at a disadvantage. And I think we have to come, make that – bring the rates down and make it a competitive thing. That competitive thing, by the way, most studies show that will help wages, okay, that will help wages. So, it’s not just helping corporations, I think it’s helping wages. And obviously, the trade that needs to be done. Also we need to help the citizens of America, not just the corporations of America. So, it’s hard to accomplish, but I believe I am begging that it gets done.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So, one of the very tangible things that’s changing with the election is interest rates and the tenure is up I think 60 basis points since November 7. But how is that impacting your thought process around how you invest your excess liquidity? How is it impacting your thought process around your securities portfolio?
Jamie Dimon
So, again, not at all, like what happens when rate goes up, obviously, the duration of our balance sheet actually extends just automatically. So, your short position becomes less over time. All things being equal, rates being up 100 basis points help us up $700 million for full year okay? It’s in our disclosure in the 10-Ks or something. The short end helps more, okay? So, the short end helps it will be $2.1 billion pre-tax for full year effect of 100 basis points for full year effect. So, it doesn’t change that much we do. It’s changed the duration. You are investing slightly higher yields. We will get the benefit of that. But again it’s not changing fundamentally how we manage the company. And this will be kind of a soft beneficiary. The important thing about rates, which is really important, is why they go up. If they are going up because of a strong U.S. economy, that’s doubly beneficial for us. If you ever have it going up to your stack inflation, well, that’s doubly negative for us.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So I think the last rate that we saw the 25 basis points, I think the deposit data is across the system what somewhere between 4% to 6%, much lower than people had thought, much lower than many banks had modeled. For the next few rate hikes, do you see that changing materially?
Jamie Dimon
We see – maybe not the next 25 and again, it’s hard for me to answer. We do that by product. So, there are like 100 different products. So, to take of the average, I just don’t have the averages, but we obviously debate it will go up for every 25 basis points, but it’s going to be more like this for most products. So, the next 25 will benefit quite a bit from the 25 of that a little bit less from the first 100 basis points like we have modeled in like $2 billion. My guess is maybe a little bit better than that because we have been really conservative. And we have looked at deposits, like what’s going to happen rates go up to some of the deposits and a whole bunch of different things. We tend to be a little bit conservative on those estimates.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So market activity, really...
Jamie Dimon
For example, I mean deposit, go back to the money market funds and that’s sort of the flow that you got to keep your eye on pretty closely.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So market activity starting with Brexit took a step-up, it seems like it’s taking a step-up post the election, how is activity level tracking in, in the fourth quarter in your securities business?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. So it’s doing fine. We are – I know you are waiting for those numbers. It’s about 15% plus, a little bit more than that year-over-year, which is obviously much better. And we try to estimate the FICC business how much is secular, how much is cyclical, it’s really hard to do. So it’s down 35% from peak. We estimate maybe something like 50% is gone forever. The rest of that may very well be cyclical and will come back eventually.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. And then across your consumer network, what...?
Jamie Dimon
The long-term, we look at the FICC businesses as the rule of material, i.e., bonds, underwritings, credit, assets under management is going to grow over time. And it doesn’t go on a straight-line, but globally it will probably double the next 12 years or 15 years. And so the raw material that drives it against that you have had obviously over time some margin compression, which is normal in most businesses and so it could be a very positive in a long period of time. What happens quarter-by-quarter isn’t as important to me in terms of how you build the business, you build the business with sales, execution, trading and obviously, more and more technology.
Richard Ramsden
And then similarly, across your consumer network, what have you seen, I mean have you seen this re-levering of consumer balance sheet really starting at the start of the year, is that still accelerating?
Jamie Dimon
We see a fairly healthy consumer. And so if you look at macroeconomic data, home prices, the consumer balance sheet, debt service ratios, the number of people working, wages going up, etcetera, we see that pretty healthy. We see a mirror of that inside JPMorgan. So we have reporting quarter-after-quarter, credit card sales, deposits, new household accounts, all those types things are doing quite well and we expect that to continue.
Richard Ramsden
So let’s switch, let’s talk a bit about your strategic priorities. So at the Investor Day, you talked about hiring revenue per seasoned employees, you talked about marketing on the consumer bank, you talked about technology investments, it feels like you made a lot of progress in all of those areas, are those still your strategic priorities or are they shifting and kind of when you think over the next 2 years to 3 years, what are the few milestones that you really want to achieve?
Jamie Dimon
So I would look at it more like it’s a consistent thing how you are running your business. So every business every year is opening the new branches, adding bankers. For example, in commercial banking, I think we added 110 bankers last year. This year, we are probably going to add something less than – next year we will probably add something less than that. But that includes going to new cities so that where we weren’t before. In consumer, it’s generally while the branch count is coming down a little bit, the investment is in marketing, so the marketing numbers will probably be going up. It’s more and more digital. There is huge investment in ATMs, digitization inside the branch and outside the branch. And we are putting a lot of time and effort in our payment system. Let’s think of Chase Pay, ChaseNet, obviously, our credit cards, Chase Paymentech. So we think that has a bright future and we are going to have a tough competition. So on that one, we are trying to look at both. And investment banking is more – I am not going to say it’s more a status quo, most of the real investments in technology. And that’s across every business in cash management, trading, banking, prospecting, that’s kind of where most of the investment will take place.
Richard Ramsden
So one of the areas that you have done very well on this is loan growth, your loans were I think were up 18% since 2013, the industry is up about 15%, how do you get investors comfortable with the fact that you are not trading off growth for credit quality…?
Jamie Dimon
Credit, first of all, a big – the credit card portfolio is growing finally after years of basically not. And we have been pretty much in the super prime and prime here. So we are actually quite comfortable. We told investors, we will eventually go up a little bit, just the vintages and changing and the fact it has historically low number. And in middle market, credit is absolutely consistent and pristine and large corporate has been pristine. In mortgage, all the new stuff is rather pristine. So a lot of the growth you are talking about is jumbo mortgage and C+ and stuff we put in the balance sheet. And we think it’s as good as it’s ever been. Obviously, there is a cycle of credit losses will go up, but nothing like you saw in the last cycle. The one area where people – auto, we have been quite kind of cautious, we have been talking about that for a while. The one area where you look at and you might say, oh my god, there is a little bit of issue, there is commercial real estate. But you split into two pieces, we do a thing called CTL Commercial Term Lending. It’s like, these multi-families, like where I grew up in Jackson Heights Queens. It’s multi-family housing. It’s in places where we have been a long, long time. It was a very, very good through the Great Recession, shockingly good. So, we haven’t changed our standards at all. We are just more aggressive in making those loans in places with somewhat restricted multi-family housing. So, it isn’t like going to Arizona, where you have unlimited land you can build houses and something like that. And then other commercial real estate, we have been also growing right I would say our standards are exactly the same. We are cautious. It’s probably getting later in the cycle for some of that. And we don’t do what I would consider we don’t do now and we have never done the riskiest type of lending. So we have always been cautious in real estate.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So you talked about your card business, I mean that’s an area that you have taken considerable market share and I think you said that the Sapphire Reserve card sold tens of thousands in the first few weeks, which was your annual budget at the time of the launch, can you talk a little bit about why you think that that was as successful as it was and can talk a little bit about the customers you have acquired and how they are being different from your expectations?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. The customers, we did the Sapphire Reserve and before we had any marketing, it just took off. So, it’s got a very attractive reward proposition and it was aimed at I think at super prime, very high FICOs, high spenders and stuff like that and older. We got the high FICO and good spender, but surprisingly a lot of millennials. So the card is being doing great. So one negative, which I think is very good thing and I think we have told to the analysts, it’s going to reduce our earnings by $200 million or $300 million this quarter because how you have to account for acquisition costs in that business, because you have to get the revenues over 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, but your acquisition costs expense over 12 months, so doing great. It’s got a great reward proposition. And if you don’t have one, you should get one and take it up.
Richard Ramsden
And the profit...
Jamie Dimon
You have the private banking one also called the reserve cards. We are going to come up with one and I think it’s probably not public yet, so I can’t say it. So we have some more good cards coming up.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So fixed income is the other area that your market share has gone up a lot, I think so, we calculated it in 2010, your market share in fixed income revenues was 13%, it’s now 22%, what...?
Jamie Dimon
You are just taking the top 10.
Richard Ramsden
Yes, this is the top 10?
Jamie Dimon
Remember, a lot of other people think of them in the top 10.
Richard Ramsden
But what do you think makes your franchise different and as your market share has grown, how has the profitability of that business changed?
Jamie Dimon
So we have been very consistent in this business, okay. And I think Goldman has been similar to us, which is it’s a good long-term business. It has a secular downturn, which probably has run through in a cyclical downturn. So it made it kind of painful for people. But we are always looking at the business from the standpoint of the clients. What does the client need in terms of execution, products, services, etcetera. And eventually, some of these things will be re-priced. So you have seen some re-pricing in the rates business, which is probably the most capital and liquidity challenge after all the regulatory changes. And you have seen the pickup in activity, but the benefit comes from just scale. And we have huge flow around the world and we have only known part of this business, scale business from technology. So most of us in this business are more and more of the business going to electronic exchanges or digitized trading. So I think it’s something like 97% of FX, 97% of equities. I think 50% of the U.S. swaps now are done on SEPs. So the digitization is happening, but we are keeping our share. And obviously, there are critical products both for the investor side and the corporate issuer side. So we have great technology, continuous investments, sales, service, distribution and global. And it is still a huge global business. So those things – Daniel Pinto put a chart up at Investor Day, which no one understood, including me at the time, but it showed our average ROE over the cost of capital. And everything but commodities was over our cost of capital. And you can guess that the cost of capital didn’t have that number down the bottom. But remember, the scale part, he showed another piece, which showed the marginal ROE. But just think of what’s the marginal contribution. So your ROE might be 15% and your margin in the business might be 30% but to the next trade, okay. So think of a rates trade or an FX rate, the marginal profitability is 75%. So this is – if you get flow in volume, you can create a very profitable franchise while giving great pricing to the clients.
Richard Ramsden
How important has been the retrenchment of some of your European banks in terms of your ability to pay?
Jamie Dimon
A little bit. I think the share in the rates business seem that we picked up a couple of points of share in the rates business because that’s the only place you have seen a lot. Other places we have seen a lot of announcements, but we have not quite seen what’s going up the shares. But you are going to see people getting out of it. But you are also starting to see new entrants by the way some of the hedge funds thinking you are thinking to going to go trade some of these areas, so in each area you have a whole bunch of different things taking place. But we are pretty comfortable using our technology or scale or globality, our volume and size and stuff like that, but we will maintain a healthy share of the FICC business.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. So let’s talk a little bit about your expense base, you have taken out $3 billion in core expenses since 2012. You have now got one of the best core efficiency ratios of any of your peers. I know that you have said relative to 2011 though you are spending an incremental $3 billion on compliance and control costs. How much of an opportunity is rationalizing some of those expenses? So, I guess to ask the question differently, if it was completely up to you, how much of that $3 billion that you are spending on control today you think is just good business practice versus stuff that you are forced to do because of regulation?
Jamie Dimon
That’s a hard thing to answer. So – because, obviously, if you look at how we do, it’s embedded in everything we do. The $3 billion was the incremental isolated number. If you say we are really spending on regulations, it’s far more than that, because we are building systems and front office takes time and middle office takes some and backlog is takes time, which is almost impossible to tease all that out at this point. But I do think when it comes to those costs you have seen the peak of it. And as these things get automated, some of the things we had to do – virtually do by hand, because we had a timetable we had to meet and we couldn’t meet the timetable building the system. So, but now these will get automated and embedded and we have simplified certain businesses and products and product lines, you will see some of those costs start to come down. So, I think we will be able to drive additional cost down for a couple of years to come. Some have not yet hit their peak either, so it’s a little bit of both in 2017.
Richard Ramsden
So again, if revenue growth does accelerate in 2017 and ‘18, how are you going to think about reinvesting in the business versus driving operating leverage? And I guess looking in the backdrop of this question is it doesn’t feel like you have held back on any investments that you felt made sense in the last few years. So, does the revenue environment impact how you are going to think about investment spending?
Jamie Dimon
No. So, when we sit down and have a business view or budget view or something like that, we always ask the question, are you doing all the things you should be doing? And don’t tell me you can’t afford it, okay? So, if you say technology spend, I always say, "should you be building X? Digital this, online boarding that, electronic trading in FICC, and to me, that’s absolutely critical. So sometimes, we can’t do it all, but it’s not because of a budget constraint, it’s because we simply we have to synchronize it. We simply can’t do A, B and C at the same time. We have to do A, B or C and then next morning – so, we have a little bit of that, but we pretty much – and same thing with sales forces. So, the same thing with how many people should you have, how many people do you rationally hire? So, we don’t tell the Commercial Bank, don’t do anymore this year because you don’t have a budget for it. If they can add 10 bankers in Nashville and it makes sense for us, then we will make money in 2017 we are going to do it. And so we have never cut back and stuff. I think we might be a little more aggressive eventually as opening branches in cities where we are not, we haven’t done that in possible other expansion, at one point, but we never sit back and say, “let’s hold those expenses here.” And we are always looking for, I always call, waste cutting. It’s not expense cutting, because companies are wasteful. There is bureaucracy. There is stupidity. There are vendors that are overcharging. I think it’s the way you are. So, we are always looking at ways to be more efficient, but always investing in what we should be investing. So, I would be very upset if a CEO of one of our businesses has walked in and said, well, I would have done that last year, but I couldn’t afford it. So, we have told folks already that we are going to be building – I hate the word global investing, but online global investing, online account opening, more and more investment in Chase Pay type stuff. And we will reevaluate. If we find out that something is not working, we will obviously trim our sales of changes, but we like the business we are in. We are investing in almost every single one. And we are seeing growth in credit card. If you look at the absolute numbers, so not necessarily revenue sometimes, the absolute numbers credit card growth is up. Credit cards are up, deposits are up, consumer accounts are up, investments are up, assets under management are up. Maybe the one thing I think maybe a little bit faster is private bankers, where they are hard to do, because they are very qualified people and we have been training professionals to have is hard. And in Investment Bank, we are dealing with big issues, which is that’s taken a huge focus. So, I think of eventually have to do with Brexit and find most of the business, etcetera. But those things I think could be have a better business offline.
Richard Ramsden
So, capital returns are obviously very important part of the investment thesis in your company and the capital generation is consistently growing. Your share price, as you talked about, is up 25% since the start of the year. It’s up materially since the election. How has your thought process around buybacks changed? Because I know you have previously expressed some sensitivity around the pricing, which you are going to buyback stock?
Jamie Dimon
We haven’t addressed that yet. I mean, it’s a good question and I owe you an answer, but you will probably have to wait till Investor Day or my Chairman’s letter or something like that. And right now, one of the issues, I have always had an issue about stock buyback and we always worry about capital allocation. If you afford to buyback stock and stocks eventually are high, you shouldn’t be doing capital. So, we will be making a determination at one point, when is the time to stop buying back stock. And what we make public and I don’t know, because that’s not – that’s the type of thing we want to share with people on the other side of that trade. But Warren Buffett came out and said, I am a buyer of 120% of tangible book value. I look at it versus book value. We are still buying back good earnings. We are – it’s hugely accretive still to buyback. So, it’s decretive in the short run to dilutive to tangible book value.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. Alright. Let’s see if there is any questions from the audience. We got about 10 minutes. So, here we go. One in the middle. Could you bring the mic?
Jamie Dimon
I should point out though the returns of all through this have been good. We have been having – not every year record year, but record kind of earnings. Our returns even have been 13% seems like for 12 this year. In prior years, it was 14, 15 or something like that. We haven’t changed how we view the business, which is the long run. It should be we hope to have 15% return on tangible equity. I remind people who think of that, something that’s unachievable in a marketplace with competition. It’s unachievable for assets you put on your balance sheet if you are buying at the same price I am buying the same capital allocated. But some of our businesses have zero E involved. There is no E. They have been built up over a long period of time, so certain asset management businesses, certain processing businesses, where you should have very high returns. And we shouldn’t subsidize a market return with giving up a higher return, so all of our businesses we think we earn – some can earn really good returns over the extended period of time, normalizing for credit.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
So, you had a big increase in compliance stuff over the last 2 years and also in consultancy costs related to compliance. Can you size some of the more onerous compliance requirements that maybe we thought as Dodd-Frank is scaled back or abolished?
Jamie Dimon
Yes, well, I feel like I don’t want to dream quite at this point, okay? So, I think we were public by the $3 billion and up to 42,000 people, up from 23,000 something in compliance and control functions. I do think that we will be able to make that more efficient if there were no changes in all these rules and requirements. If there are changes, that could be more than that, but I don’t want to be guessing about that. Legislation can take a long time to be passed. So, we shouldn’t get frothy over it. And like I said, if it opens up, hopefully we are part of the conversation about what is the right thing to change that keep the system safe and sound, do the right compliance and all that, but make it little bit more efficient and reduce some of the overhang for the banks? I also think was more able to do it efficiently than some of the smaller banks, we have always been very – we agree with the smaller banks saying it’s been more burdensome than it has been in us. And I think that’s some of the general argument, but we don’t want to give that a number at this point, plus it will just piss off the regulators.
Unidentified Analyst
You mentioned the marginal efficiency of a FICC trade, have you thought about the effectively marginal efficiency on the consumer side of a new customer coming? And how – and you also mentioned the FICC side of technology is driving that, consumer side, same thing. So, why do you think they saw drive long-term efficiency really low?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. So, you are actually right. So take a credit, take a checking account. I forgot the exact numbers, but it’s roughly like this. There is $250 to give you a checking account, on average, but 80% of that is fixed. It’s the branches already there, the ATMs are there, the systems are there. So, the marginal profit is very large. So – but of course, what happened in checking accounts is the revenues, again, very rough numbers, went from $300 per account to $200, but it’s exactly why we never stopped opening accounts. Those – the revenues will eventually go back when interest rates normalize closer to 300. And so you will have improving efficiency having done nothing. So to me, we are opening accounts. They were marginally profitable. They reduced our average margin, but it was the right thing to do. And so you are right. When we get some of this recovery, it’s going to all go down in the bottom line. And so you will see that in some other businesses, too. So, we always look at marginal contribution and fully allocate it, because you have to manage your business a little bit to both. And I think at Investor Day, we will be updating the efficiency targets. I wouldn’t change it from what we gave you, because we already build into those normalized credit and normalized interest rates. And so we need some of that to get to where we were. But we always look to try to be more efficient. And if we can find ways to be more efficient, so we recently looked at or maybe when you guys wrote, I think it maybe have been you wrote some of the – when they asked about a good article about the efficiency ratios in the some of the banks where they have less branches per person in Europe and stuff like that and they are considerably lower. They are like at 40%, not 55%. So, is it possible that over time, you can drive that? Yes, I think it’s possible.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning. As I analyze JPMorgan, I can think through a lot of different parts of the company, but the one area that I still have trouble with is the interconnectivity of the investment bank. And you operate in a global world and the playing field globally is different on the capital front and liquidity front, how can you protect yourself against, again say, some weakness in let’s just throughout Europe, for instance, and say, the euro, just as an example, what you do differently today to protect yourself in difficult environments there?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. So we run – so virtually go country-by-country, okay. And we look at what’s the business in the country. In every country you can look at the multinationals that are developing themselves, think of the Fortune 3000. You can think of multinationals going into the country and you can think of a multinational going out of the country. So in all these foreign countries you do business in, we have three types of flow, okay. And those flows don’t go away even in a Great Recession. So even if you look at the Great Recession, we made money in Argentina. We made money in Brazil. We made money in this, not because, let’s say, we haven’t a credit loss in the country. So and we are always looking at building those businesses. We stress them all the time like how much stress can we bear, how big can they get and we run scenarios. Obviously, one obvious scenario is the Eurozone crisis. That would be pretty bad. I mean, unraveling the monitory union will be pretty bad. We can survive it. We have played a time with barefoot, but we made money in Italy I think almost every quarter through the Great Recession, and we have extended more credit, not less, we are trying to help our clients get through it. So surprisingly, some of these businesses have more give and take than you think and more stability, a couple of annuity streams. Cash management is a little bit more like an annuity stream, even certain FICC. People do regular hedging and FX and regular swapping and regular stuff like that, bond issuance is not quite episodic because you can look at bonds maturing and you can see what needs to be based to be rolled over. M&A is episodic. So some of these things are very episodic, but you can look at the business even mine is episodic, you will probably be okay. But the big risk, you can say Brexit, certain huge risks yes, we are quite conscious of that. You can get your costs cleaned in an environment. But even in that, I have always said to our investors like I tell my Board, we have – you can look at our exposure in China might affect our credit exposure and this is not exactly the same as risk. You can look at our credit exposure of all the major countries and kind of iterate what you think will happen on bad scenarios. But like even in terrible scenarios, JPMorgan Chase will be fine. In the Great Recession, we made the best stress test, which is a nine-quarter thing. How much money do you think we lost, we made $30 billion pretax. We never lost money in a quarter and again, partially because there was a diversification. The investment bank didn’t lose money in the quarter. And then of course it had a boomer right after that as markets recovered. So we try to be very patient and thoughtful. I would say, manage the risk, build for the future.

Can you talk a little bit about…
Jamie Dimon
And we run 120 stress tests a week. So we do one CCAR year, but we do 120 a week around the major credit and trading risks that we have. And if you said to me, if stock market is down 50% a year, credit loss was 20% there, FX spreads were moved by 10%, we could push a button and tell you what the answer would be on today’s trading book. So we are pretty – we would try and we run those things what we try to manage that exposure. So the biggest losses under all these scenarios wouldn’t be something that would bother shareholder that much. I mean it would hurt, but I wouldn’t be embarrassed over that kind of thing.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. Another question here.
Unidentified Analyst
Jamie, I take your part that you don’t want to answer Richard’s question related to the buyback, but do you think, given how things are evolving regulatory wise, we have reached the point where we could see dividends starting to move back towards 40% or 50% levels…?
Jamie Dimon
I do. I have been consistent. And the [indiscernible], they have made it clear in public statements that 30% is no longer [indiscernible] number. So different companies have different strategies around that, so you can grow rapidly, in certain areas you can do M&A and that pride your lower dividend and retain more, but if you can’t, so I think you might go to 50%. One of the things they don’t like about the current scenario we have is that if you can always be 30% and you are going to certain you were forced to buyback stock, that’s a bad form of capital management. I don’t – I personally don’t believe that buying back stock is giving cash to my shareholders. I think buying back stock is giving cash to my leaving shareholders. I care much more about the remaining shareholders. And so I want that to be a bargain. And I did this thing about years ago if we buyback stock, I used analyst estimates and I said, cut it by 20%, buyback so much a year, what does it do over the 5-year period for tangible book value accretion, earnings per share accretion, stuff like that, so that is the kind of thing we will be looking at. I want to know when we buyback a share of stock that we are doing you a favor. And other than that, I would rather – if the stock was selling at a certain price, it makes it better give you special dividend. And we just haven’t got there yet, because we kind of got surprised by this increase in the stock price.
Richard Ramsden
Okay. We have any other questions from the audience, otherwise.
Jamie Dimon
There is one here.
Richard Ramsden
Yes, go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you talk about being considered for the Treasury Secretary and will there be any situation where you would have accepted the job if it had been offered to you?
Jamie Dimon
I have always been fairly consistent. I love my job and I do think I am really suited for that, but I did immediately joined this President-elect Trump group as Steve Schwarzman. I am a patriot. I want to help my country and I want help them grow and I want to help the low wage people just like I probably want to help the more than I want to help you, put it that way. And so I want to do my share to help America get better and we have got lot of ideas and thoughts to how to do it and we will do everything we can. I think I might do a better stuff from the outside doing that from the inside.
Richard Ramsden
Okay, alright. If we don’t have any further questions Jamie, thank you very much.
Jamie Dimon
Thank you, Richard. Thank you, folks. Thank you very much.
Richard Ramsden
Thank you.
