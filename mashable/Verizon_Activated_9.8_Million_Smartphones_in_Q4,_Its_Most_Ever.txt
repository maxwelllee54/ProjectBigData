Verizon Activated 9.8 Million Smartphones in Q4, Its Most Ever
Verizon announced Wednesday that it expects to have activated nearly 10 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, making this its strongest quarter yet for smartphone sales.
The company revealed in an SEC filing that it expects smartphone activations to total 9.8 million for the quarter thanks in part to a "higher mix of Apple smartphones."
The announcement comes one day after AT&T said it sold a record 10 million smartphones in the quarter. It's like that sales for both carriers were helped by the launch of the iPhone 5, which was released in September. 
It's important to note that the total number of activations may not perfectly translate to the total number of sales, as one can activate a contract on an old phone without buying that device from the carrier.
More details will likely come out when the companies release their quarterly earnings reports later this month. Verizon is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 22 and AT&T is scheduled to report its earning on Jan. 24.
