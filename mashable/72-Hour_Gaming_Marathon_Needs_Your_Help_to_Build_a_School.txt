72-Hour Gaming Marathon Needs Your Help to Build a School
Fortunately (unfortunately?), the world did not end in December, as those silly Mayans predicted. But that won't curb our appetite for apocalyptic games.
The folks over at gametoaid.org have launched another three-day game-a-thon for charity. Tune in to #Apocalyptathon, a live, nine-game spree benefiting Free The Children, a non-profit that builds schools in developing countries. All the games on the docket play on apocalyptic themes.
"If we reach our goal of $8,500, Free The Children will be able to build a schoolhouse in one of the countries that they work in," says Toby Zerner of GameToAid. "We'll let our viewers choose where."
Also, PRIZES. For every $5 donated, you'll be entered in a raffle to win copies of fan favorites like Borderlands and Super Meat Boy. The grand prize, which will be drawn at the 72-hour mark, is a shiny new Nintendo Wii-U.
GameToAid also added a referral program. Tell your friends about the fundraiser, and every $10 they donate gets you another raffle ticket.
The apocalyptic games on tap are:
Half-Life 2 (PC)
Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (N64)
Doom (PC)
Resident Evil 4 (GameCube)
Darksiders (PC)
Zombies Ate My Neighbords (SNES)
Left 4 Dead 2 (PC)
Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse (NES)
Halo: Combat Evolved (Xbox)
As of this writing, GameToAid has raised $1,063.
