Pantech Discover Is Headed to AT&T January 11
LAS VEGAS — The Pantech Discover is on its way to AT&T. At CES Monday the carrier announced plans to start carrying the Android handset on January 11.
The 4.8-inch smartphone has a 1280x720 high-definition display, surround sound speakers, NFC functionality, and a 12.6-megapixel built-in digital camera capable of recording 1080p video at 30 frames per second.  The phone will operate on AT&T's 4G LTE network.
Following in the footsteps of the Pantech Flex, which was released on AT&T in September, the phone will offer Pantech's Easy Experience mode,  which makes interacting with Android easier for new users.  Users can also opt to use the Standard Experience mode on the handset. Both modes — standard on the left and easy on the right — are shown in the photo below.

The Discover will also be the first smartphone from AT&T to come pre-loaded with AT&T's DriveMode application, an app that attempts to prevent texting and driving. Once set up, the app will auto-reply to messages that are sent while in a vehicle moving over 25mph, allowing driverâ€™s to let friends and family know theyâ€™re behind the wheel.

"AT&T is dedicated to educating customers about the dangers of texting while driving and providing real solutions to help prevent the behavior.  With DriveMode pre-loaded on the Discover, we hope that users will be less likely to text and drive."
Calls that come while a user is driving can be automatically sent to voicemail. Users have the ability to turn that feature off, and can create an "allow list" of specific callers that will always get through while they're on the road.
The Pantech Discover will be available on January 11 for $49.99 with a new 2-year agreement.
