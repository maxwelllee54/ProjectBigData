Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Conference Call. My name is Kim and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Erich Merkle, U.S. Sales Analyst. Please proceed.
Erich Merkle
Thank you Kim and good morning everyone. Before we get started I’d like to just introduce a couple of new folks that we have with us on the call. First of all we have John Felice here. John has worked many, many different positions here at Ford over his 29 year career. A list that’s probably far too long for us to go through here today, but John is now our VP of U.S. Sales, Marketing and Service and we’re really pleased to have him here. I’d also like to introduce Emily Kolinski Morris, some of you may remember Emily, she was, her last call was about three years ago. She is now back working with Alan’s team in corporate economics and she is also here to join us on the call. So we’re all really excited to have them here and we welcome them.
So with that in mind let’s kick things off and we’ll talk about the month of October. So when we start taking a look at early morning reads of the data. We estimate that October finished at approximately 1.26 million vehicles for the industry, translating into a high 15 million vehicle SAAR for the month, this includes medium and heavy trucks. If this holds it would provide the industry with an approximate 12% increase over year ago levels.
At the retail level we estimate the SAAR came in at the low 13 million vehicle range and equates to approximately 83% of the industry for October. We saw some weakness in the first half of October leading up to the deficit season debate, but it appears October has provided a level of resistance with a solid close to the month.
Taking a look at some of the line item, some of the segment details, full size pick-ups represented approximately 12.5% of the industry for October, compared to September’s 11.8%. Compared to year ago October of 2012, the segment was about 12.8% of the industry, so just a little less than October of a year ago. This translates into what we believe will be a relatively flat year-over-year sales for the segment as we approach more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Throughout the month small cars ran at about 21% of the industry. This is slightly lower than September’s 22% and unchanged from 2012’s performance.
As we have been reporting for the last few months, the small utility momentum just continues. The segment comprised of just over 15% of the industry in October, consistent with September’s strong performance. And it’s really a 24 percentage point higher than this time last year. So we continue to see the strong secular trend story play out as empty-nester baby boomers continue to shift and beat smaller utility vehicles.
So with that overview I’d like to turn things over to John Felice, John?
John Felice
Well thank you Erich and good morning everyone. It’s great to be with you to share October results. Ford Motor Company, posted a 14% increase, with total sales of 191,985 vehicles in the month of October. A real stand out for us is our retail performance of 142,487 vehicles sold, which is up 15% relative to last year and represents our best October retail sales results going all the way back to 2004.
Given the governments shut down we’re really pleased with the month’s sales performance, for both the industry and particularly for, as Erich mentioned, we did some resiliency late month. What’s really encouraging is our newest vehicles that are accelerating our retail sales growth. We can continue to see focus and strength coming from our passenger cars, which are resonating with consumers based on our great styling and fuel economy.
A particular note is the refreshed Ford Fiesta, which posted its best ever October with sales of 4,337. Our strongest sales are coming from California, which represents a 16% increase or 16% of all Fiesta’s sold nationally and retail sales in the state are up a strong 11% on a year-over-year basis.
Also of note is a shrink of Ford Fusion now with improved availability and shipments coming out of flat rock. Last month Fusion sales surged with 21,740 vehicles sold, a 71% increase over last year, which is the first time Fusion sales had exceeded 20,000 unit mark in the month of October. Compared to the prior October record set in 2011, Fusion was up a strong 20% at a total at 29% retail.
Dealers on the coast have been very pleased with Fusion sales performance, we’re seeing some of our fastest retail sales growth for Fusion on the coasts including New York up 127%, San Francisco up 116% and Los Angeles up 77%. Seattle was also showing a lot of strength up 94% while Miami has been up 62%. Fusion broke an October retail sales and every one of our five market areas nationally.
October ‘13 Escape sales of 22,253 vehicles were up 12% this marks Escape’s best performance since October 2001. Well we’ve been doing great on the West Coast, one market area we’ve been watching closely with Escape is New York. The tri-state area representing the largest utility market in the country over 10% of all utility vehicles sold in America today.
Escape’s retail sales performance in New York market area is up 86% for October representing record retail sales for the month. It’s so encouraging that we are attracting new customers to our brand with Escape. Our largest competitor conquest in the New York is behind the CRV.
F series trucks continue to show strength in roll off the other lots with 63,803 trucks sold in October an increase of 13% versus year ago levels. This represents our sixth consecutive month above 60,000 sales and our 27th straight month of year-over-year gains. The last time F series sustained more than 63,000 sales for six consecutive months, was in April was the period, April to September 2006 which is seven years ago.
On the Lincoln, Lincoln sales were up 38% for October led by strong MKZ performance. MKZ sales saw an 80% increase with 2,909 vehicles sold. October represent MKZ’s best ever October retail sales months we’ve then benchmarking the sales performance of MKZ since April which is considered to play at which MKZ at adequate supply on dealer loss.
From the April through September period because we don’t have all the numbers in yet for October Lincoln MKZ sales are in the upper quartile of the mid-sized luxury segment. For this period MKZ sales ranked fourth behind only BMW 3 series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Lexus ES.
Importantly we’re seeing average transactions prices up more than $6300 on the new MKZ and we continue to attract new customers to the brand particularly with the MKZ hybrid. We’re encouraged by the October results on Lincoln but as mentioned on prior calls the reinvention of Lincoln brand is a journey though we measured in year’s not months.
You’ll be hearing more good news a bit more good news about Lincoln next month’s so stay tuned. We’re really pleased with our progress to date. And the new products we have for the future of Lincoln.
With that, that’s a quick look at Ford Lincoln. And I’d like to turn things over to Emily for an update on the economy front. Emily?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Great thank you so much John and Erich. So all though there has been some disruptions to the economic data releases until last monthly sales call in early October, the available data suggests that economic conditions continue to improve at a modest pace. Manufacturing sector growth continues at a steady pace through September, housing sector gains are showing some signs of moderation but with a broad based recovery still in place.
Job and income gains are stable but modest and interest rates are remaining low. And that we project the U.S. economy will grow in the 1.5% to 2% range this year. Here are some detail. The September purchasing managers index just out this morning was at 56.4 up two-tenths from September, so that’s still indicative of positive growth in the manufacturing sector.
The October University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment readings was down over 4 points from the prior month to 73.2 and that was primarily due to the unfavorable assessment of government policies. At the same time though an increased proportion of respondents stated a good time to buy a vehicle was up 5 points from the prior months reading.
Housing related data demonstrates the strength in the housing sector remains in place. The pace of existing home sales growth moderated in September but remained up over 10% compared with the year ago. Tight supply is keeping prices high and maybe contributing to the moderation of the sale, in fact home prices represented by the Case-Shiller Home Price Index were up 12.8% in August as compared to a year ago marking a sixth consecutive month of double-digit price increases and the largest gain since February of 2006. Price is relevant all 20 cities covered by the index.
September housing starts and permits for October will be released next month with the November report. The most recent four week moving average of jobless claims is at 356,000 in the week of October 26 as the government shut down and also, a backlog of claims in California continue to flow through the four week average.
Weekly claims were down 10,000 to 340,000 so the pace of job gains at about 1.7% over a year ago remains stable but modest and this sort of job growth is consistent with heavy gains and after tax incomes which are running at less than 1% year-over-year growth so far this year.
Nonetheless consumer spending remains positive with September retail sales excluding autos up 0.4% from the prior months, little bit stronger than the gain we saw in August. Low borrowing costs and rising consumer wealth should continue to support consumer spending growth going forward. And as I mentioned on that we think this sums up to a U.S. economy growing at about the 1.5% to 2% range this year.
On industry sales just to recap as Erich mentioned September industry sales estimated in the high 15 million unit range seasonally adjusted including medium and heavy duty trucks. And our full year cost for the industry this year remains unchanged at 15.9 million units.
So with that summary let me turn it back over to Erich.
Erich Merkle
Thank you Emily we’re going to take care of some housekeeping items here before we turn, turn it over to questions. So if you start taking a look at our, our fleet as a percentage of our total sales. For the month of October, our fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 26%. For commercial, that was 12%, for government it was 6% and for rental it was 8%. This compares to our fleet as a percent of our total sales last year October of 2012 of 26%. For commercial it was 14%, for government it was 5% and for rental it was 7%.
Taking a look at the calendar year-to-date data when we look at our fleet as a percentage of total sales January through October of 2013 it was 29%. 13% was for commercial, 5% was for government, 11% was for rental. When we looked calendar year-to-date January through October of 2012 our fleet percentage of total sales was 31%, for commercial it was 14%, for government it was 5% and for rental it was 12%.
Looking at our inventories for the month of October. October, 2013 our gross stock for cars 216,000 vehicles, trucks 262,000 vehicles, utilities 166,000 vehicles for a total of 644,000 vehicles that translates into a day supply of 91 days.
Looking at September of 2013 for cars it was 188,000 vehicles, trucks 245,000 vehicles, utilities 144,000 vehicles for a total of 577,000 vehicles translated into a day supply of 75 comparing to October of 2012 one year ago cars were at 136,000 vehicles, trucks were at 238,000 vehicles. Utilities were at 133,000 vehicles giving us the total of 507,000 vehicles translating into an 81 day supply. So with all that information Kim we’re going to start taking some questions. And first we’d like to open it up to the folks in the Analyst community please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen we’ll now take questions from the analysts first. (Operator Instructions). And looks like your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley please proceed.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Hi everybody I was wondering if you could give. Hi, how are you? Could you give a bit of color on the [indiscernible] sales in the month especially with attention to the government disruption. That’s my first question and then also I was wondering on the F series sales in the month how much of that roughly was model of your ‘13 versus ‘14 and if you could give us the same split of ‘13 versus ‘14 on F series inventory that you’ve got the dealers. Thanks.
John Felice
Hey Adam this is John good morning.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Good morning.
John Felice
The CAGR’s of October we’ve seen as we mentioned on last month we’ve seen just a bit of softness but a robust industry sense for Labor Day period but again what we saw really in the month was some softness. But we’re very encouraged what we saw the retail demand and the industry bounced back in weeks three and weeks four to come back pretty close to plan in the overall industry performance, so slow start and then a pretty good recovery as the month ended.
Erich Merkle
And I’ll take the second part to your question there Adam when we look at our F series our mix between 2013 and 2014 in October it was just under 80% of our mix for ‘13 F series meaning that the remainder were ‘14s and the inventory is very running very close to that, just under 80% our 13s. It’s also important to note that when we look at F150s for the month of October, they were all, they were almost all 2013 models.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Which, that last point what was almost all 2013 models?
Erich Merkle
Oh the F150s. The super –
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Okay the Super Duty.
Erich Merkle
Changed over a little sooner. In the F150s are changing over now as we speak.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Got it okay.
Erich Merkle
30 to process this month.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Thank you for clarifying, when do you think you’d be at a point where the majority of your sales could be then the 2014 model for the F150?
Erich Merkle
We’re still looking at a few months out for that, I mean you’re looking at, you’re going into next year.
Adam Jonas – Morgan Stanley
Understood, thanks very much.
Erich Merkle
Okay thank you Adam, Kim could we take the next caller please.
Operator
Yes your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan – UBS please proceed.
Colin Langan – UBS
Hey thanks for taking my questions, any color on whether you think the government shut down had an impact on the selling rate this month and do you think it’s fair that there’s any recruitments to the extent that people kind of push up purchases?
John Felice
Hi Colin this is John again. It was very related to the prior question to some degree. Again we, it’s very difficult to put a point estimate on the impact because there’s a lot of moving parts in the industry obviously. But again we were encouraged by what we saw in the overall performance in the month of October it was a little bit lumpy, because again the first couple of weeks were a bit slower.
But things seemed to pick up in the final two weeks. So it’s very difficult to see if there’s any pent up demand rolling in November but given again based on what we’re seeing thus far the industry is pretty much on plan and estimate that it probably isn’t going to have too big of an impact on the forward months.
Colin Langan – UBS
So should we interpret, it seems like if you looked at earlier in the year it started, had been a bit stronger and do you think there an underlined weakness there or factories shut, the shutdown maybe is not having an effect and there’s some underlying weakness in summary.
John Felice
Yeah when we had looked at this it’s a little confusing because we’ve had a few months here that have been a little odd shall we say compared to previous years. For instance in September we saw that the Labor Day holiday season actually got counted in August this year, as opposed to last year when it’s normally counted in September. So at last month’s call, we looked at the three month period and we’re running around the 16 million SAAR. Right now we’re looking at something in the high 15s for this month. So I would say that’s right about where we thought the industry should be operating at, given last month’s call we are looking somewhere around 16 million.
Colin Langan – UBS
Okay and just on last question, earlier this week consumer reports published their reliability study. And again I saw another tough year for Ford. Any color now as to why you think you’re still sort of ranking now low on that survey and that you think your entire team and exposure is a big drag impacting your other fact that you have lot of impact, any color why you think the performance continues, it’s going to be weak.
John Felice
Yeah Colin obviously we remain absolutely committed to providing all our customers with quality that’s among the best in each of our new vehicles. As we previously discussed we’re working to address some of the past launch issues we’ve had and working really with all of our stakeholders. But I can tell you that focus on quality is obviously something we’re keeping very, very close.
Colin Langan – UBS
And have you seen any impacts associating with that I mean do you think this will impact yourselves in near-term or is this more the long-term type, more focus?
John Felice
Well we’re always going to be committed to quality of course and we haven’t seen any material impact. Like I said we have our, we’re having our best retail sales month here in October, best October retail sales month since 2004, so it’s been pretty strong for us.
Colin Langan – UBS
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Erich Merkle
Okay thank you, Kim we’ll take the next caller please.
Operator
Okay your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs, please proceed.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs
Thanks yeah my question is mostly on, I guess two questions the inventory at 91 days, it’s higher sequentially in year-on-year. Is that, is there kind of a pre-build that’s purposeful there or is it just gotten a little ahead of itself or I know you did take your fourth quarter production estimate down when you reported earnings last week.
So maybe a little perspective on there and then also I mean the C-Max was one of the models I believe where you had taken some schedules down, it was a little soft this particular month. Maybe you could tell us is there kind of any issues on the take rate with that that’s maybe leading to underperform, thanks.
John Felice
Well thanks for the questions Patrick maybe I’ll take the first for you, on the inventory situation on 91 days, you’re really touching on a point in terms of getting ready for what we anticipate to be a very strong seasonal period in the industry in November and December.
Again we remain very committed to match supply to demand and we feel very good in the position that we’re heading into this November and December period. Which again for the industry remains very strong, as we also said that again last week we did announce some adjustments. Machine assembly plant to address, anything we have in terms of getting ahead ourselves a bit with inventory.
And the answer to your second part of your question Patrick is when you start taking a look at C-Max’s, there’s more than C-Max produced there we also produce the Focus there as you well know. But when we look at C-Max sales when we compare to September, C-Max was actually up 16% compared to September.
And we might add in a lower fuel price environment, gas prices are quite affordable these days. So, and the other thing that we’re really looking at in terms of just our hybrids and our electrified vehicles, we’ll be releasing our full hybrid report, our electrified vehicle report on Monday. But we are particularly looking for real strong performance in plug-ins this month.
Patrick Archambault – Goldman Sachs
Got you. Okay, okay. Thank you, very much.
John Felice
Okay. Great, thank you, Kim our next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America, please proceed.
John Murphy – Bank of America
Good morning guys.
John Felice
Good morning John.
John Murphy – Bank of America
Just a question, I mean there’s been a lot of press on incentives on the F150, I’m just curious if you can comment on the pricing there. And also just really to understand as we switch over from the model your 2013 to the model year 2014, what changes are you making to the truck and would they be material enough to maybe increase pricing or pullback or incentives or a combination thereof?
John Felice
Sure I’ll take the first one there John, so I mean we’re really as always very pleased with F series transaction prices which remain among the highest in the light duty segment so. Our average incentive spend, for F series was approximately $4,400 per truck, in October, which I have to add is much lower than our competitors averaged spend as they were, many of them selling down their 2013 model year trucks earlier in the year. So we continue to be very disciplined around our incentive spending on F series that I’ve mentioned this before but we really all year, we’ve been a very tight range of around $4100, $4500 per truck on F series. So we continue to operate, continue to operate in that range.
Erich Merkle
Yeah and if I could add John as you know as we share with the third quarter results we remain focused on improving our overall net pricing and the transaction pricing over the past several years. As a result it’s been a big driver of our record operating results in margin of around 10%. And when you look at our transaction prices they’re among the best for a full line manufacturers.
And as Erich mentioned incentives tend to vary based on a lot of factors including of the newness in the products, of the changeovers that we’ve touched on some in this call, in response to competitive actions. But again we remain very focused on driving and sustain this outstanding performance in North America.
John Murphy – Bank of America
And John just to follow-up the changeover from the ‘13 to the ‘14 model year, are there any major tweaks or are we waiting for that on the truck at the end of next year.
John Felice
Yeah John, we actually do have some changes we’ve made to the ‘14 in terms of adding some models within the lineup, like adding features and content. We’ve added leather seats to our XLT, we’ve introduced this year an STX crew cab, but again it’s a changeover model with some adjustments and enhances made on a carryover year.
John Murphy – Bank of America
Okay and then just lastly Erich on the Fusion, obviously it’s going gangbusters. Just curious if you could just comment on the mix of vehicles that you’re getting there, because it seems like this is getting critical mass, and I’m just curious if the mix is still very rich there.
Erich Merkle
The mix stayed rich, I’m sorry John could you clarify just a little bit.
John Murphy – Bank of America
Your achieving levels [ph] and you’re selling a lot of titanium’s or the other launches?
John Felice
Yeah I would add John, you know again we’re very pleased with the Fusion, not only in the volume and share growth but on the transaction prices. To your point, on the mix and the receptivity of the styling, the fuel economy technologies, consumers are voting with their wallets and ordering very well equipped Fusion’s.
John Murphy – Bank of America
Great. Thank you, very much.
John Felice
Alright thank you John. Kim we’re going to take one more call from the analyst community then we’re going to switch it over and start taking some calls from folks from the media.
Operator
(Operator Instructions).
John Felice
Okay, great. Kim we’re going to start taking some calls from the folks from the media community.
Operator
No problem. Ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions from media. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Deanna Durbin [ph] from the Associate Press. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning thanks for taking the call.
John Felice
Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst
Erich it sounded like you were saying fuel prices at their current level is one of the main factors we’re seeing for the small car, small car declines. Are there any other factors going on there – focusing C-Max in particular?
Erich Merkle
Sure, sure I mean there are, you’ve got, when you look at it Deanna the small cars in terms of the overall segment, there is in terms of the percent of industry it’s about even with a year ago in terms of the decline in focus we continue to remain, our mix has been, it’s been a little more weighted towards some of our newest products so if you look at both the Fiesta and the Fusion were up. The Fusion was up very strong so in our overall passenger car sales are up 19% in October which we believe likely outpaced the industry by a pretty strong margin. So and globally as you know focus continues to be a very strong selling product for us.
John Felice
Deanna this is John just to add one more thing and as Erich sited earlier one of the trends we’re seeing in terms of shifts in the industry is a very small utility segment. This is about our third month if the month’s finishes where we think it will about a 15% mix of the industry and some of the source of that shift has come from the car side of the business. So again it just seems to be the small utilities have been a very hot segment off late.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay great. Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Thank you.
John Felice
Kim we will take the next caller please.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Elisa [indiscernible] from Detroit Free press. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning gentlemen.
John Felice
Hi Elisa.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi there a couple of things first off you’ve mentioned that with the 91 day inventory part of that reason is that you are preparing for strong demand in November, December so I’m guessing that you are referring to trucks so I’m just wondering, is your inventory heavily skewed to building up your truck inventory and also whether you have any other temporary adjustments planned at any plants to kind of get your raw [ph] material inventory where you wanted to be?
John Felice
No Elisa we feel like we’re in a really good position as we finish out the year here. It’s not just about trucks when we start taking a look at sales yes the trucks did very well at the end of the year. But overall seasonally the industry is very strong as we head into November and certainly into December. So we want to be very well positioned for that. And as you well know we’ve already announced that we’ve taken some action to better match our supply with demand that Michigan Assembly and we feel right now with the actions that we’ve taken and given where we believe the industry is going to come in November and December we feel very good about our inventory position.
Unidentified Analyst
So are you able to give a breakdown between cars and trucks so in your inventory?
John Felice
We will the next business day we send out, we send out a report to all of the data houses and it goes out so –
Unidentified Analyst
But do you give the sense now?
John Felice
Right now. We have some, we have absolute numbers if you’d like to ask we don’t have it, we have so for trucks we have 262,000 for the month of October cars at 216,000 and utilities at 166,000.
Unidentified Analyst
And just finally the fuel prices effecting hybrids and plug-ins and those kinds of sales?
John Felice
Well we’ve actually seen some I wouldn’t say some really good activity in terms of our overall hybrid now we’ll have the full electrified vehicle report comes out on Monday but we’re really excited about what appears to be really strong performance for our plug-ins.
Unidentified Analyst
But our hybrid turning lists, better fuel prices.
John Felice
I would say I don’t, I can’t speak for the entire industry because not everybody has reported yet. But I think you’ll be very pleased with our hybrid results.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thank you.
John Felice
Thank you very much. Kim next caller please.
Operator
Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Trudell from Bloomberg. Please proceed.
Craig Trudell – Bloomberg
Hi guys good morning. I had a question about Fusion and how many Fusion’s you were able to get from flat rock in October and if we should actually expect more supply coming from flat rock in the months ahead.
John Felice
I mean we’ve got our shift going at flat rock in i.e. terms of what the mix is in terms of how many came from flat rock and how many came from Hermasillo right we don’t have that with us but flat rock did start shipping in October and it had an impact for us in October for October sales.
Craig Trudell – Bloomberg
Did it have a full impact or are you going to have a more of that model coming out of flat rock going forward?
John Felice
No I think we’re in a really good position with where we’re at right now particularly as we’re coming into November and December so we’ll feel, we feel real good about Fusion.
Erich Merkle
Yeah, Craig, it’s been a big as we talked about on prior calls it’s been a big plus for us because obviously we went through the summer months where the product has been very well received in the marketplace, laid on inventory so it’s wonderful to be in a position to take care of what we anticipate to be strong demand as we head into November, December.
Craig Trudell – Bloomberg
And is pricing holding up on that model now that you have more supply coming?
John Felice
Yes it’s as I mentioned earlier the transaction prices are at the top range of the segment again with customers choosing the very well-equipped Fusion’s given the features and contents.
Craig Trudell – Bloomberg
Thank you.
John Felice
Thank you Craig. Kim next caller please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brad [indiscernible] from Automotive [indiscernible]. Pease proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi guys just two questions any indication that the C-Max slow performance might have been affected by the restatement of the mileage. And second did you see any regional slowdown due to the sequester in the northeast region of the country thanks.
John Felice
Sure well if you look at the C-Max no we don’t think that at all in fact like I said sequentially C-Max sales were up 16% and well while I don’t have the industry end for the light vehicles so I can’t comment on everyone but I think if you look at the competitive set I’m sure it performed quite well. And we also saw some great activity on the plug-in aspect of it too. So –
Unidentified Analyst
And in terms of the northeast?
Erich Merkle
We’ve while qualitatively Brad we did hear from areas that are heavy government influence like Washington DC early in October traffic was affected. But as we look at sales results and we’re still digesting by region we didn’t see any massive shifts in overall performance of the country.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks.
John Felice
Alright. Thank you sir. Kim our next caller please.
Operator

Erich Merkle
It’s around 37,000.
Unidentified Analyst

Jeff Bennett – Wall Street Journal
Thanks very much Erich I don’t know if I missed this but how much day supply or inventory do you have of F-Series?
Erich Merkle
Yeah we haven’t broken that out yet. Again we usually publish our inventory report it’s the next business day.
Jeff Bennett – Wall Street Journal
Okay.
Erich Merkle
So we’ll have to wait on that just until, until Monday.
Jeff Bennett – Wall Street Journal
Okay and then one final one I noticed that the focus sales were down and some of your other competitors also reporting kind of softer Sedan segment sales is there something going on there what should we make of that?
John Felice
Yeah Jeff again I would say in terms of our car performance overall we’re very pleased with the overall portfolio of car performance at Ford. We did see as Erich mentioned a lot of strength with both Fusion as well as Fiesta our newer models focuses was down a bit year-over-year. As we’ve touched on earlier what we have seen is a shift from cars in general over the last few months to the smaller utility segment which again has been very, very strong at about 15% to the industry. We haven’t concluded whether this is an ongoing trend yet but it has been a near-term trend for about the past quarter.
Jeff Bennett – Wall Street Journal
Okay and just lastly do you guys anticipate doing a Christmas shutdown this year or do you think that with demand that you’ll probably be running all of your plants through December?
John Felice
We haven’t given any indication on that Jeff so –
Jeff Bennett – Wall Street Journal
