Magisto App Uses Artificial Intelligence to Automatically Edit Videos
LAS VEGAS â€” If you struggle with editing videos, then an app called Magisto might be just what you're looking for.
Available for iOS and Android as well as on the web, the app takes your videos and edits them automatically, creating high-quality movies you can then turn around and share with friends or family, or upload to the web to share with the masses.
There are plenty of apps that help the average user create professional looking photos, but nothing has done that for video, said Oren Boiman, CEO of Magisto. He said, "We dove deep into the art of editing and production and given people the ability to truly tell their stories. We've fully automated and simplified an extremely sophisticated process to a few clicks, and believe this will solve for what's missing in social video today."
At CES 2013, Magisto announced a new group feature for sharing videos, video albums, and themes. The company also announced an updated algorithm for automatically editing videos, and completely overhauled its website design to make editing easier.

The updated algorithm uses artificial intelligence to analyze what's going on in your video and make edits in the right place. Magisto understands what's going in the video, picks the best parts of your video, and then edits them together to create the perfect completed project.
Users can choose from themes ranging from Gangnam Style to Warm & Fuzzy to set the tone for their finished product, and can add a title, special effects or soundtrack. Magisto's algorithm takes into account the theme you've chosen for your movie, and adjusts its editing style accordingly.
The Groups feature in the app allows you to select with whom you share your finished videos. For instance, you might drop a finished video of your child's birthday party in the Family group to share with your immediate family, and video of your last skiing adventure in a Ski Friends group containing just your friends who love hitting the slopes.
Magisto originally launched in late 2011, and was the winner of the 2012 CES Mobile Apps Showdown. The app plans to introduce additional features in the coming months, including collaborative storytelling where several users can contribute to the same finished movie, and support for TVs and other connected devices.
Magisto is part of a growing number of apps designed to edit videos on the fly.  For instance, an app called Vyclone geo-locates videos shot on mobile phones, and auto-edits those clips together.  Another app, Strum, edits 15-second video clips, adding a video filter and custom soundtrack to those clips based on a particular theme.
