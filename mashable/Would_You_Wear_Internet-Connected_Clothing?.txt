Would You Wear Internet-Connected Clothing?
It could be so simple â€” you just leave your house and your Internet-connected T-shirt will tell your social networks where you are going. 
At International CES 2013 on Tuesday, one of the creators of the Internet, Vint Cerf, gave a talk about the future of the connectivity and pondered just how far it would expand. 
Cerf asked the audience, "What would happen if our clothes were Internet-enabled?" reported CNET. 
"Can you imagine if you lost a sock? You could send out a search and sock No. 3117 would respond that it's under the couch in the living room," Cerf said to the audience, according to Computerworld. 
Cerf, Google's chief Internet evangelist, determined this might be a bad idea: 
"But maybe that's not a good idea because you could tell your wife you're at work but then she texts you to say your shirt says it's down at the bar." 
We've already seen high-tech fashions come to life: a smartphone-charging trench coat; a wearable laptop carrier; or this T-shirt that has an LED screen and connects to your smartphone to access the Internet.
