Analysts
Dave Schoch
Good morning everybody. How are you doing? Okay?
Unidentified Analyst
Good.
Dave Schoch
All right very good. Well it's a real pleasure for me to be here today to take you through our journey in Asia-Pacific and to talk about our business, our new products, and also to take a look at the changing dynamics of the markets in Asia-Pacific. Of course, the business environment continues to be very dynamic, and today I will update you on our journey, we will talk about how we are being competitive and how we are leveraging in Asia-Pacific, the One Ford plan to accelerate our growth.
Now, as a reminder, Asia-Pacific is part of Asia-Pacific and Africa. I am going to concentrate most of the comments today on Asia-Pacific, but there will be some slides that have reference to Africa in them, okay? Just so you gauge yourself.
And we will start off with a view of the One Ford plan, many of you know that, and then move to the consistency of our plan between the global plan and the Asia-Pacific, and then we will talk about how we are growing in the region.
So, next slide; I think most of you are familiar with this slide. This is our plan, and it hasn't changed and it is still relevant today, as when we first used it as our guide.
Our objective is very straightforward; to serve all markets with a full family of best in class vehicles, small, medium and large, and cars, utilities and trucks. Everything is executed, based on the One Ford plan, and we are delivering profitable growth for all.
At the heart of the plan is really our product development, and these are products that we believe customers want and value, and we are strengthening that portfolio not only in the traditional markets, but also strengthening it in the emerging markets around the world. We remain focused on two brands, Ford and Lincoln, and our plan is based on providing customers and vehicles that are basically consistent with our four major areas, and we call these our product development pillars. And their quality, safety, fuel efficiency, safety and smart technology, and we believe that by delivering these products to our customers that they will value, that in these four areas and we execute it correctly, these products will be a value to our customers, and -- as perceived by our customers.
The plan, in addition to our brand initiatives, we are progressing our efforts to unlock scale in the region, and optimize our global footprint, improve our flexibility, and obviously improve our balance sheet; and I think that now the fact that we are rated investment grade by the four major rating agencies, is further evidence of the continued progress for making not only in the company, but also in Asia-Pacific, and our plan is to maintain investment grade throughout the cycle, that's typically accompanies the automobile industry. So our objective is now that we have reached that hurdle, we don't go backwards, and we maintain that investment grade.
Key to our whole -- our product development strategy is our platform strategy that really underpins everything we are doing with our new products, and with essentially 85% of our global volume is now based on nine, well I call, global core platforms. So we have substantially reduced the number of platforms that we have, again, it gives us the ability to generate more products, it's a faster product cadence that we have, we can take advantage of the economies of scale, not only within our manufacturing operations, but also within the supply base, and it's also driving engineering and investment efficiencies throughout the product development cycle.
And as you take a look, let's just use the CCAR, which is the focus, which is the yellow at the top. As an example, we plan to bring to market 13 distinct and different Ford products off of that platform in the next several years, with a volume of over 2 million units globally. So with 2 million units, you can certainly see the scale and the efficiencies that we are driving.
Now when we take a look at Asia-Pacific, we have basically taken the One Ford plan and overlaid that in Asia-Pacific; and if you ask me, is the One Ford plan working? You don't have to look beyond Asia-Pacific to see that 10 years ago, we were a group of loosely organized countries, affiliates, and with no real product plan, we were borrowing from Europe, the U.S., and we really didn't have a strategy. We now have a One Ford strategy, and we are optimizing the One Ford plan in Asia-Pacific.
We are bringing in, on the back and the strength of the One Ford plan over 50 new vehicles and powertrains by 2015 and within that, we are bringing in 15 new vehicles and SUVs into China. So we are accelerating the pace of our growth.
We are expanding our dealer network, we are expanding our capacity, which I will talk a little bit more about in just a minute, and obviously the plants -- that we are in the capacity we are putting in place, is allowing us to achieve greater scale.
We have established Thailand as a regional manufacturing hub, within the ASEAN group, and we have established India as one of our global export hubs. Together with our joint venture partners in China, we are growing our business there on the strength of products that we manufacture in China, which I will show you in just a minute, supplemented by built-up imports that we are bringing in from elsewhere around the Ford world. We have located our Asia-Pacific headquarters in China, and we are also expanding our product development capabilities within the region.
This slide is just an example of how we are leveraging our global product portfolio. This happens to be the products that we are introducing or have introduced into China, and you can see that they very much mirror the global platforms; and this has enabled us to bring the full line of products into China, and we have more to come, and when I think about what we have done in the last six months, just in the launch cadence, we launched the new EcoSport and the new Kuga, which are fully integrated manufacturing in China. We have launched the Fiesta mid-cycle freshening. We have launched the Focus ST and the Fiesta ST, as built-up imports, and we have also launched the Explorer.
So right now in China, we have the full strength of our SUV family lineup. So we have got the EcoSport; we have got the Kuga; we import the Edge; and we also have the Explorer. So we are very strong in SUVs and the -- it's interesting because the Chinese customers are responding very-very well to our new products.
When I take a look at -- this is an internal study, but I think the point I wanted to make here is that, we are -- based on our studies, we are re-freshening our products at about twice the pace of what the -- major pace the competition is doing in the region. This is based on competitive data that we can get in the market, but the key here is to not just be satisfied with the products we have out there, but to continue to refresh them, so the showroom is one of the freshest in the industry.
We are in a growth industry. In 2012, the circles basically are global volume. So in 2012, we roughly had 82 million units. We expect by 2020, that the industry will grow -- global industry to about 108 million to 110 million units. So we are certainly in a growth industry.
Now within that, Asia-Pacific represents just about, slightly under 50% of the volume, and you can see that China represents about a third of that. And when I think about Asia-Pacific and what it means to Ford Motor Company between now and 2020, over 60% of our growth will come from the Asia-Pacific markets. So Asia-Pacific is very-very important to us, not only in terms of growth, but also in terms of profits.
Now if you take a look, a little bit closer look, the major areas within Asia-Pacific, of course you have China, and we expect that that volume will grow roughly from 20 million or 21 million units this year, to something under the order of 30 million to 32 million by the time we get to 2020. So it's still a tremendous growth opportunity in China, primarily as we move -- basically we move west, and we develop the tier three, four, five and six cities.
India, also we expect to grow, from roughly around 3 million units to 7 million units by 2020, and we also see growth in ASEAN as well. But clearly, China and India will be the growth engines for Asia-Pacific.
Who is buying our vehicles, this slide is a bit daunting, and really exciting. This shows you the number of new potential buyers that are coming into the market. Not to say that they are all going to buy, but these are middle -- such customers coming into that middle income, and they could be eligible to buy products; and you see in China, an increase of about 430 million people between now and 2020. About 350 million people in India, and ASEAN about 200 million. So the pace and growth of development there is huge, and there is an opportunity to really grow the industries.
Now to meet that increasing demand, we are increasing our capacity. We are investing in 10 plants. We will take our capacity up to 2.9 million units, by the time we get to 2015. Within that, about 1.7 million of that capacity is within China itself. About 1.2 million of passenger capacity and a little under 600,000 units of commercial truck capacity. As I mentioned, we are introducing over 50 new products, vehicles and powertrains within that time period, so this capacity coming onstream is very important.
We are also, by the end of 2015, expanding our segment coverage, in other words the market coverage where we play, to over 50%. So you can see, on top of that, we still have a vast opportunity to further expand our segment coverage.
In Asia-Pacific, I mentioned capacity, we are basically expanding. We have got 10 new plants that we have either launched or under construction. Other 10, seven are in China, two are in India, and one is in Thailand. Over the last 18 months, we have launched four of them, and so we have six more to go, and when we finish that, we will be at the 2.9 million units.
In addition, in China, Chongqing is basically our manufacturing home, and once we get finished with our construction there of another assembly plant and two powetrain plants, we will have the largest concentration of manufacturing in Chongqing, in China, outside of southeast Michigan. So Chongqing is really our manufacturing home.
Now just to show you and how we are bringing these plants to life. For the next couple of slides, we are just going to show you some of the physical. So you can get a sense of the size and the cadence of how we are launching our products.
So the first slide is Changan-Ford Engine Plant. This is in Chongqing. We basically opened it in June. It's an investment of $500 million, and will have capacity for about 400,000 units, and these will be our EcoSport, 1 liter and 1.5 liter engines, supporting Kuga and Mondeo and Focus.
On the next slide; this is in Nanchang. This is where our commercial truck business is. Jiangling Motors is a joint venture. We have a little over 30%, and we have just opened a new assembly plant there, again in June. You can see a very familiar face there. Alan was in the region to help us launch the plant. $300 million of investment and capacity of about 300,000 units. They will primarily manufacture the transit and the cargo, and then the JMC indigenous brands that they are already manufacturing -- that they have. And then, a little bit later in 2015, we will launch an engine plant alongside of the Xiaolan plant.
Early next year, we will launch a new transmission plant, again in Chongqing. This will manufacture automatic transmissions. It's about $350 million in line of capacity of 400,000 units, again in Chongqing, to support the Focus, the Kuga, the EcoSport and the Mondeo.
Shifting away from powertrains, we are building new capacity plants. This is Ford Chongqing plant number three. This is an investment we are making of around $600 million. It will come onboard at the end of 2014, and it will provide capacity of about 300,000 units in China.
Then we have announced plans and are building a plant in Hangzhou in China. This was the first plant out of Chongqing, it's actually on the Eastern coast of China. It will launch in 2015, and have capacity of over 250,000 units, and we are investing about $750 million in the site.
Now shifting out of China, I am going to take you to India, where we are expanding capacity in Gujarat. As most of you know, we have facilities, assembly and powertrain facilities in Chennai, which is down in the southeast, and Gujarat, Sanand, is really on the west coast. We have under construction a major engine plant, which is shown here, and that will be ready in 2014, and have capacity of around 270,000 units a year. It's on the same site as our Sanand vehicle assembly plant. In total, for the total site, we are spending about $1 billion, and as I mentioned, we have elected it and we are forming India to be part of our -- one of our global export hubs, and Sanand will contribute to that.
Here is just a schematic of India. We can see the effect of scale there, and we already export the Figo to about 37-38 markets, and then with the addition of Sanand and Chennai, we are going to make India more of an export hub, shifting to Africa, to Europe, Australia, and they also ship to Mexico. So we do believe that converting India, will take care of not only domestic use, but it's going to be a good export hub for us as well.
We are expanding our dealer network, so we have got the products coming in. We have got the capacity coming onstream. Now we need to make sure that the distribution network is expanding as rapidly. This slide shows China, India and ASEAN. India and China, over the next several years, by 2015 will have expanded by almost another 15%, compared with where we are today, and with India and ASEAN, we will be expanding about 30% in each of those markets in terms of incremental dealerships.
This dealer count does not include Lincoln which we announced last year, and in the latter part of next year, we will be bringing Lincoln to China. We have already selected 11 dealers. We will start out -- we will launch with [parts] and then gradually expand. But we will be bringing in -- Lincoln will be added to our portfolio of products. It has a very good brand image in China, and in the premium market, along with the SUV markets are probably the fastest growing segments within China.
I think you have seen this slide before; but this summarizes our second quarter earnings, and you can see on the far left, our wholesales are up 27% versus a year ago. Our revenue is up 35%. Our pre-tax profits were $177 million versus a loss in last year, and our operating margins were about 6%. Our second quarter share was 3.6% throughout Asia-Pacific and that was up a whole point from the prior year. So I continue to believe that we are on the right track. We are leveraging the One Ford plan, and that Asia-Pacific will continue to grow and be a significant contributor to the bottom line profits of Ford Motor Company in the mid-decade.
So some key takeaways; the One Ford plan that we brought to Asia-Pacific are delivering results. We expect that significant industry growth, as I have shown you by 2020, throughout Asia-Pacific, but in particular China and India. We are investing in the product and the capacity and our distribution network, basically to provide for the 15 new vehicles we will be bringing into China by 2015. We expect to have the precious showroom lineup in Asia-Pacific, and we are engineering our new products based on our global platforms, and getting leverage of scale, investment efficiency and engineering efficiency.
We have got the 10 new plants that I have talked about, four of which we have just announced, that we have launched and six more to go, and we are adding dealers. So I continue to believe that Asia-Pacific represents a huge growth opportunity for Asia-Pacific for Ford Motor Company, and for me personally, it's really a privilege to be in the region, helping to accelerate the growth.
This is our key metrics and planning assumptions. Basically it is unchanged from what we released in the second quarter, and again, the total company pre-tax profits to be about equal or higher than the prior year. Our operating margins are about equal to 2012, and we expect our related cash flow to be above last year, which is very good news.
That's all contributing to our mid-decade outlook, which is basically unchanged. But the point I want to emphasize here is that, Asia-Pacific will continue to be one of the engines that drives and supports Ford Motor Company's growth, not only from a share and volume standpoint, but also from profits.
With that, I wanted to leave plenty of time for questions and answers. So I'd like to turn over the floor.
Question-and-Answer Session
Unidentified Analyst
Absolutely. Thank you so much Dave. It's a great presentation. We have about 15 minutes or so for Q&A. Maybe I will kick it off, and then just feel free to raise your hands and ask questions. Investors, they first began to focus on the Ford Asia story, the biggest sort of pushback we got at (inaudible), is how are they going to gain share, being somewhat late arrivers to market, and yet your share has gone from 2% to now 4%, you have a lot of products coming. Can you talk about, in the future -- first, what percentage of your buyers right now are still first time buyers, and as we think about the growth in China, moving to central and western regions, where the density is still low, how is Ford positioned in these regions where there is still lot more density increase left to go; and does the play favorably to you, or how do you (inaudible) of your competition thereof?
Dave Schoch
Well certainly, I think you can see the share growth in on the strength of new product introductions. When I take a look back two years ago, the -- when you walked into the showroom, we had the Fiesta, the Focus, the Mondeo and the S-MAX and that was it. And now when you take a look at what we have just launched in the first half, and then I think about the new Mondeo which we are launching now, and by the way, the new Mondeo is like the Fusion here; and I mentioned Kuga before, that's the same thing as the Escape, just so you know that they are the same global products.
So on the strength of our new product introductions, in that cadence, we are gaining share, and we are basically on-track, I think to basically double our share compared to where we were last year, as we go out of this year. So we are very pleased with the share progress we are making. Our new products are obviously resonating with our customers.
Somewhere between 70% and 75% of our customers are new car buyers, first time; and when you think about, and you think about the slide that I showed of the new customers coming into the markets, in China and India, and ASEAN, there is still tremendous growth opportunity, at least for first time buyers. And the -- most of the market growth over the last 10 years, much of it has been on the east coast in China, where the wealth has been. The government is now looking to push west, and to develop these tier three, four, five and six cities. Now these cities are still -- you are still talking about a tier six city with several millions of people in there. So they are not small cities that you are talking about. And we think we are well positioned. Our concentration of our dealer development is really west, and we are not leaving obviously the big centers, and we will continue to grow there. But most of our growth is going to be going west.
Our Chongqing facilities are actually in the west, so actually the market is moving towards us. Several years ago, I would have said that Chongqing was probably a competitive disadvantage, because most of the market was on the east coast, and we were in Chongqing with our manufacturing operations. Most of the supply base was on the east coast as well, so we are shipping component parts in the Chongqing, and then shipping finished product back out.
We have become much better balanced at this point, and given the concentration of our manufacturing facilities in Chongqing, we have been able to attract a lot of the supply base there. So over the last five years or so, we have become much better balanced in terms of our footprint. So I think we are well positioned for the growth that's coming.
In addition, we've got a lot of new products we are developing, which are really exciting, and as I mentioned to you, we are expanding also our engineering capability and skillsets in China, in Nanjing, where we are basically doubling our engineering and research center, and those skill-sets are improving, and should have ability to do [top outs] the skills to do [top outs] for our new products in China. So I think we are well positioned, and I am really pleased with the product portfolio, and we have got a lot more to come.
Unidentified Analyst
So I guess, most of your success or a lot of it this year has been driven by Focus and more recently, vehicles like the Kuga and Mondeo. As you increase capacity in China through mid-decade, and you are launching larger vehicles to participate in the SUV boom that we are seeing in China, what do you expect your segment mix roughly to look like around the decade? It seems like to us, that it's moving towards higher margin vehicles, may be greater transaction price to the ASPs, is that fair and may be what do you think the kind of segment mix of the company might look like at that point?
Dave Schoch
Well, for the vehicles that we have introduced right now, and you take a look at the segmentation, many of our vehicles do play in the higher end of those segments. And we have got a strategy to launch those products, but also to expand our segment coverage, as I mentioned before, down into the heart of the market, and even into some of value areas. So for instance, when we launched the new Focus, which was around April or May of last year in China, we launched the new Focus, and positioned it at the higher end of the segment, and we repositioned the old Focus or the Focus Classic, down into more of the heart of the segment. So thereby, giving us product differentiation, but also additional segment coverages. And as we move forward, we will be looking for other opportunities to introduce or maintain some classic vehicles to expand our segment coverage.
Certainly -- and there is plenty of opportunity there when you take a look at the signs of these segments. Very clearly, we are building upon the (inaudible) strength of our SUVs and the whole family of SUVs in the market, and I am really pleased, because between SUVs and Premium, they are the best growing segments. And I think when we bring in Lincoln next year, again, end of the heart of one of the luxury segments that's growing very fast, Lincoln, should take off very well as well.
Unidentified Analyst
Then another key area investors have gotten more accustomed to thinking about JV structures for auto companies in China? Can you talk a little bit about your JV partner, how Ford is progressing with that relationship? Any risks in that going forward that we should be thinking about, and just sort of how the day-to-day relationship with your partners that works?
Dave Schoch
We have two joint venture partners, as many of you may know. On the passenger vehicle side, we have our 50-50 joint venture with the Changan Automotive Group. So it's Changan-Ford 50-50, and that's primarily passenger car. So everything I have talked about Chongqing and Hangzhou is all around the Changan-Ford joint venture.
Our second joint venture is with Jiangling Motors. They are a commercial truck joint venture. We have a little bit over 30% equity in the joint venture, and they primarily make the transit, future cargo, and then also the indigenous brands that JMC already has.
As you know, you have to have a joint venture partner in China. In the last two years, I have gotten to know or get reacquainted with both of those JVs, and it's very much like a marriage. You have got to work at it. Sometimes it doesn't come easy, but I am really pleased with the relationship we have with both joint venture partners, and I think you see the progress we are making, and we couldn't do it without them. They do bring some things to the party. They do bring knowledge of China, knowledge of the supply base, knowledge of government. But obviously, at least in Changan-Ford, it's entirely our brand, so we are bringing the product, the global production processes, the global operating systems to the party. So we continue to nourish those joint ventures, and you got to think about it that way. That it's a requirement to have joint ventures. Even if you wanted another partner, which we don't, but even if you did, there probably wouldn't be another one out there, and we are cultivating and really I think developing a keen relationship.
For Changan-Ford, we have been in existence for basically a decade, and I liken it to a young child, where over the last 10 years, this child has needed nurturing and coaching and parent support. But now, 10 years later, and as we grow with all this capacity we are adding, all the new products, the child is growing into its teenage years, and it's becoming more independent, able to think and act on their own and I think they are going to need less parental type of support. And that's the idea, to really indigenously grow the joint ventures.
Unidentified Analyst
Another question we often get is around the profitability, capacity additions, what's your latest view on industry capacity. Do we potentially have an issue coming in the next couple of years? What are just your overall thoughts on industry profitability? Is the auto industry perhaps over earning a bit right now, or would the volume and mix and content offset that? And lastly, do you think Ford has the capability as you add capacity to reach some of the profitability metrics that we have seen from some of your peers?
Dave Schoch
I think -- my personal view is, the automobile industry has upward opportunity, in general, and including Ford. And I think again on the strength of our new products coming in, I want to be able to contribute a substantial amount of bottom line value to the company. So I don't think the industry is overcooked at this point. In terms of capacity, once again let's just keep the comments to China. We are putting capacity in place to achieve certain share targets, our visionary share targets. We have announced plans so far, the 2.9 million of capacity for total Asia-Pacific, we have announced that through 2015. We haven't made any announcements beyond that. But when I think about the continued future growth of China and India and ASEAN, we have certainly got to be looking at that all the time. So I am not too worried about capacity in the near term. Obviously, we watch capacity, making sure we match our supply and demand very carefully.
And if we have a near term issue with demand, we will make adjustments accordingly in our production. But in the near term, we are basically making everything we can, and I am not real concerned about in the near term, about capacity issues. Any questions?
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. In the intermediate term, is there a fair share of market in Asia-PAC that's reasonable, seems about right, and just qualitatively where does the market share come from five years out?
Dave Schoch
I certainly think in China and in India, that market share is going to continue to come from -- let's do China for a moment. Between the new people that are coming into the market, the first time buyers, and I also believe that we are going to be gaining share from some of the indigenous Chinese manufacturers. So I believe our products will continue to be competitive, and I can't give you any actual share figures, right. But I am very confident that we are going to continue to grow, and gain share.
Unidentified Analyst
The share area, which you referred to -- the three years' volume, that seemed like a very big number.
Dave Schoch
3.6%. But it was up a full point from last year.
Unidentified Analyst
Right. So if you gain a point a year, three or four years, then you get the growth rate of the overall, I mean that would tend to be like a lot of growth, right? Start layering in?
Dave Schoch
I think we have said, if you take a look at the mid-decade guidance, right, globally, we want to be 8% to 9%, and when I think about the opportunities for growth in North America and Europe, and there is, but most of that growth is going to have to come from China, or from Asia-Pacific.
Unidentified Analyst
In the last year, how much of the market share growth do you think the automakers, in light of protest and to the extent that it will taper off a bit in the future. Maybe your market share gains that you have made in the past year --?
Dave Schoch
In my view, it's a small risk. The Japanese still are being affected by the political dispute between Japan and China, and their shares are down, their volumes are down, and I am sure that we have picked up some share on the back of the Japanese being down. But overall, I believe that we are gaining the momentum we need, and while we keep our eye on the Japanese very carefully, I am not too worried about them right now, in terms of coming back and taking share away from us. I think our products are very-very competitive, and we will be fine.
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible]. Can you expand on that, in terms of what you would do?
Dave Schoch
Well we stress test the balance sheet, we want to make sure we generate positive cash flow and continued profits, and that's our vision. We have worked so hard to get back to investment grade after a long dry spell. We don't want to go backwards. So we believe the fundamentals that got us to investment grade, we need to continue. Recognizing, that we are going to have cycles, industry cycles over the next 10 years. But our objective would be to do everything we can to maintain that rating.
Unidentified Analyst
So it takes us on to the operating performance to defend those ratings mean -- you can (inaudible) for down cycle. Would it mean doing things to defend the ratings or ensuring equity for example?
Unidentified Company Representative
We have a multi-faceted approach to our capital strategy, and it includes continuing to reduce our debt, as we move forward. Our target to mid-decade is about $10 billion, it's to continue to fund and derisk our pension plans. It's to -- as Dave mentioned, to hold what we see as the required minimum amount of liquidity, which we have defined is about $20 billion. We need a lot less than that to run the company, but the remainder is there to protect for a potential downturn. We see our metrics driven by both our continued strong operating performance and the continued strengthening of our balance sheet, as providing the capability to achieve higher investment grade ratings in the future.
Unidentified Analyst
You add a little bit of color on (inaudible) --?
Dave Schoch
Certainly, aftermarket sales of parts in the Ford Parts and Service division is very key to our growth. And further Tony, and the team, the Global team are in Asia-Pacific. They are helping us grow their partners with us, and this is very key to me, because it's not only just the profit we generate, but also the customer and sales and service satisfaction that we bring. So FCSD, our Ford Parts and Services is very-very important to us, and will be an integral part of our growth strategy.
Ford Credit is also an integral part of our strategy, particularly in China. The capital markets are really immature right now, but Ford Credit is in China, they are growing with us, and in my mind, as a strategic partner, they will continue to grow, both in the wholesale financing and retail financing. Obviously, we like capital markets to open up a little bit more, and we are working with the government on ideas, of how it might be able to participate in some pilot programs, and help them develop those markets. But Ford Credit will be a very important part of our growth strategy, not only for our dealers, but also our customers.
Unidentified Analyst
I think with that, we are just about out of time. I want to thank Ford Motor Company for coming back to the industrial conference. Dave, George, and John, thank you so much. Great presentation. We liked it a lot. Thanks again everyone.
