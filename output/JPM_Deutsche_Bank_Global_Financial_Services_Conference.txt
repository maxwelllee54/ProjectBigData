Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank
Matt O'Connor
Okay, thank you. We're ready to get started with the next session. With us today is JPMorgan and from JPMorgan, we have Gordon Smith. Welcome back Gordon, you - couple of years I believe. Gordon covers basically all of the Consumer and Credit Card payment areas. He is in charge over JPMorgan, so lot of very important areas and very topical in my opinion. So again welcome.
Gordon Smith
Thank you.
Matt O'Connor
I do want to start on kind of big picture question, you see so many customers apart across so much of the country, how is the economy feels like it's choppy, is it any different than it was a year or two ago?
Gordon Smith
I think, just on - it's always little choppy because nothing is in a very straight line up in terms of improvement but I would say net-net that we’re seeing a slow continuous improvement in the economy that we've been observing now over the last three or four years as the employment rate continues to improve, we are really seeing a broadening of the improvements.
So what do I mean by that, if you go back two years, you would have seen the much more affluent segments had recovered perhaps three years had recovered quite quickly, equity markets look very strong, we saw very good spending on credit and debit in those segments but in the kind of middle and lower middle income segments much weaker, those are coming back actually quite nicely right now.
Matt O'Connor
And I guess specifically though which areas, which indicators do you see, is it a credit card where you can see kind of the middle part of the country and the lower coming back? Is it some of the other consumer lending business?
Gordon Smith
Yes, I think if we look at credit and debit you see kind of an interesting story that particularly kind of travel and entertainment. So restaurants particularly look very strong and again across all those income segments when they would have been looking quite weak in the lower income segments this time last year.
So credit and debit shows that, I think the continued growth that we’re seeing in deposits is strong again across all income segments and housing still the weaker part of the economy but showing very slow, very steady improvement
Matt O'Connor
And how is that translating into loan balances. Obviously your part of the company has some run off, so there has little bit of out learning that you have to do.
Gordon Smith
Well, we do have some run-off. We have some run-off in credit cards from some of the historical portfolios, when you - when we did the Washington mutual acquisition that we picked up, I don't know $26 billion, $28 billion worth of loans and we knew that almost entirely run-off with about $5 billion, $6 billion worth of circuit city loans which went bankrupts. So that run-off is in process.
I think loan gross is just going to continue to be very anemic. It looks very consistent with what we saw last year strengthening a little bit by the way on the small business space. So consistent in credit card with what we’ve seen over the last 12 or 18 months, little bit stronger on the business banking side which is encouraging but I think net-net there is an encouraging sign there. I think the consumer is being very careful not to move themselves back into a heavy debt burden. And I think for the longer term success of all these businesses and for the industry, that's a really positive situation.
Matt O'Connor
I guess how do we reconcile the comments that the economy is broadening out, we were seeing it in some of your businesses but we're not always seeing it on the loan growth. Is it running standards for JPMorgan and for the industry is still bit higher than maybe they should be at this point of cycle. Is it just deleveraging by the consumer, is that combination of both.
Gordon Smith
I think the deleveraging cycle of the consumer has worked its way, fairly substantially through but what we're not seeing is re-leveraging by the consumer in any meaningful way. And again that's why I think kind of net-net that will be a positive. One of the very interesting piece of work which is done by the JPMorgan Institute using predominately our consumer dates. When you see the number of consumers who really don't have the ability to work through a shock, whether that shock is loss of a job, being out work for multiple months, or reduction in hours. So, I think the fact that we aren't seeing heavy re-leveraging is a positive outcome.
In terms of the credit box, that's obviously something we watch very, very carefully. And I'm certainly very comfortable with where we are in the credit cycle and in terms of where our credit box is right now.
I sometimes get asked questions at the credit boxes a switch that we throw. And it’s really a lot more complicated in that but just give you a little bit of a sense of some of the things that we try to do, and this is for each of the assets classes whether its mortgages, whether its credit card, whether it's also finance or business loans.
As we constantly look at the worst performing decile, and how does that compare to a time series across that bottom decile, we look at the top decile if you like of the clients. So we try to take those new applications if you like and we take the decile, the best decile that we didn't approve and try to look at the quality and desegregate them and see if we're comfortable with the decisions that we made.
And so when you factor all of those things in, I think the credit box is in just about the right place for where we are in the cycle and that doesn't mean that we’re not going to constantly making modest adjustments
Matt O'Connor
Maybe switching to just the credit card as a whole, we've seen obviously some portfolios change hand or about to change hands here, it feels like the competition has or hasn't picking up. Would you agree with that and how do you think margins are and the outlook for card?
Gordon Smith
I had [RJ Bangor] [ph] just immediately before we came on the stage and obviously it's got very, very hot at this point in the co-brand cycle. I think as we do a couple of things which are driving that, interest rates are if not quite, close to an all-time low and certainly credit losses are at an all-time low by an all-time low I think, since the late 1950s when the credit card industry got started. I’m not sure that we've seen loss rates at this level.
So those are driving a very different economic picture for the partnerships right now and there is no doubt in my mind that costs will rise, as deals get renewed and I think that's just a little bit of the cycle that we’re in.
Matt O'Connor
And if we think about JPMorgan and the card business, clearly the spend volume has been multiples of the industry, it's really been just a complete 180 since versus pre-crises, what you build out in the card. Do you still see this content between the spend and some of the fee revenues and I know I asked you before but lot of rewards in there, I think dragging down the fee which is kind of investment in the business, where we are on that, where we in terms of seeing some of the spend growth more part of the bottom-line?
Gordon Smith
I'm really happy with where the card business is right now, hopeful we view out, even, you can always hope for more - the returns that we’re seeing across that business have really been strong.
If you go back to pre prices mode, it was what I would call a very transaction oriented business and many of the players in the card business had exactly that model and some still do. Largely it was a model based on acquisition vantages which says, I went out to acquire a loan whether I did it through balance trends though which probably a very large piece of it, and let's just index a customer to month one of that - the first month their customer for the bank, their index had 100. Over the next 2.5 to three years, that would just run down to close to zero.
So in effects what you were doing is, it was really kind of a consumer finance business in the credit card space and that was very little usage. If you ask the customer even if they knew where the plastic was, they might say no.
And so obviously with the business like that, it's not really an annuity business you're constantly cycling through customers. We change that fundamentally in 2008, 2009 and 2010 to be much more relationship oriented and with the new value propositions not that we've talked about before with Sapphire and Inc. for business, changes to the freedom, the new awards programs we put in place, I guess they are not new any more, that's seven years old now.
And so, now we are capturing much more of a customer's wallet. We are there kind of primary cause. We've really focused on the customer experience, we've seen constant improvements in JV Power over the last number of years. And so there's - the relationship between the amounts spent and the amount of revolve is driven I think is permanently disconnected from what we used to see and will be as a ratio lower.
I think as we start to see particularly in credit card the end of that run-off cycle, when I look at the growth rates and obviously we don't disclose this dates when we pass the portfolio and we take the - if I will call them the new products, the Freedom's and the Sapphire's and so, they see much higher levels of outstandings growth than the portfolio in aggregate.
Matt O'Connor
Can you switch into mortgage, can you remind us what JPMorgan mortgage strategy is and how you feel you're executing on that?
Gordon Smith
Yes, I think what we're working to do is both on the originations and the servicing side to build a really high performing business that will be successful through multiple economic cycles. And we are investing really heavily at each stage in the business.
So at the front end of the business, we have a new product called Mortgage Express, a new platform called Mortgage Express, we have been working on for over the last five years or so which will help us to be much more efficient on the origination side and help us to scale whenever we see volumes coming back, whenever that will be in the meaningful way will help us to be able to scale up and scale down the people side of the mortgage business much more efficiently and much more effectively.
So, continuing to invest there on the servicing side of the business, just continuing to drive automation and to be in the performing servicing space.
Default servicing, the cost of service price rises about 50 fold as the customer goes into default. So we want to position the servicing business, as a performing servicing business if you. I know that we just completed or in the process of completing an acquisition of some of Ocwen's performing servicing.
So, I think what you'll see overtime is that we'll build very robust mortgage business, that will have a good servicing platform and be able to have a lot less volatility in its earnings power overtime.
Matt O'Connor
And moving to auto, there seems to be some different views on the auto industry as a whole, is it too lag we are in the bubble, I heard this morning that sales are likely to be the highest they've been in many years. What's your take on just the auto industry as a whole and what's JPMorgan doing in the auto lending business right now?
Gordon Smith
I don’t think that there's a bubble. Clearly units have risen substantially now back, well into where they were before the financial crisis. But I think anyone is also purchase particularly new car sales. The level of technology and as a result of technology, the level of safety that's coming - I was just talking to someone the other day and this person was saying that they don't want their college age children to be driving 15 year old cars, because the newer vehicles have got much better airbag constraints on the side of the car, the backup camera is just so much - so many more safety features.
So I don't think there is a bubble, I continue where we've kind of back away a little bit and we started backing away a little bit and we started backing away in the first quarter of 2013 is in the true sub prime space and we were becoming a little concerned about kind of the layered risk in sub prime, which was up kind of margins was shrinking, loans-to-values were rising, durations were extending.
And we were beginning to see a little bit of deterioration in those credit bucket roll rates back and so. I think we’ve roughly gone from around 5% share of that space to probably about 3 or just under.
So selectively pulling back, but I would say broadly we’re very pleased with the auto business, certainly margins are much tighter than they were right after the financial crisis that's to be expected, but I think it’s a good asset class. And I don't see a bubble yet, but certainly something is got to be watched very carefully.
Matt O'Connor
A few questions on deposits, payments, digitalization, I guess starting with deposits, the first question that I most often get is, when rates rise how much will you keep, how much will you have to be priced. We hear a lot at the parent company overall JPMorgan confidence that you've being conservative there, but your space was probably is on the deposits. How do you feel about reprising and is your kind of breakpoint like a couple of increases, not much than from there they have thought?
Gordon Smith
I think, I've been really pleased with the performance we’ve had on deposits but for us the deposits it’s the outcome. And so we bulk on a $22 million plus retail banking customers.
And the key for us is to become the primary bank for those customers, that their paycheck has been deposited into the bank account with Chase, their mobile banking use with Chase, and they look to us as their primary bank. When they do that, we gather the deposits so the deposits obviously being a very important outcome, but still an outcome nonetheless.
Second thing I would say, so I think if any of us were to look back over the last four or five years, and say equity markets would rise to the degree that they have risen. We do expect deposit growth to continue to be what it is, I think almost to a - because everybody would say differently now, because we’re looking in high inside. But very few people would have expected the level of optimism that we've actually seen.
All of that said, I would expect that rates rise - as interest rates rise we’ll see the growth and deposits slow. I would hope that we could keep our delta in terms of performance relative to the industry but I would expect rates to slow - rate of growth to slow.
So we've been very disciplined in terms of pricing and we've also - I think this is an important point is that - I would say anyone who has predicted when rates are going to rise has got it wrong at this point.
How many of us will move sit and discuss in at the end of last year or probably in that Investor Day for JPMorgan Chase in February or expect it in June, July, I think we did a show of hands in the room and said who’s now expecting a June or July rate increase. My guess is we’re going to see zero hands go up and maybe it's moved to the end of the year.
So what we’ve really been trying to do and we’ll come to expenses I know, a little bit later on is really focus intently on the efficiency side of the business, because we can't influence rates.
Matt O'Connor
So then if I could read in to expenses and efficiency, I mean you read out last year it's a pretty aggressive expense targets, update us where you are on there?
Gordon Smith
Yes, just to remind everyone, I know you need no reminding, but we said that if we took the kind of exit rate for 2014, and then we look at the entry into 2017, so we kind of took that two year window that we take $2 billion of expense out of the consumer and community banking based as an absolute.
And we laid out a number of different areas that we were going to attack to make that happen. Progress is very good and I’m very pleased with where we are. Marianne Lake I think recently said that, that wouldn't be entirely in 2016 we make a good down payment I think was the term Marianne made in 2015 and we will.
So very good momentum behind the expenses and importantly we're trying to be very, very diligent about how to get those expenses out. It's very easy to go, if I take no effort at all to go and do things like cut marketing and cut sales, that will get expense out quickly and then slowly over time so revenue will start to be impacted and then at some point, someone then puts that money back in and then they’re not sustainable savings.
So we laid out I think some pretty good plans around the branch automation what we're doing with digital and mobile, how we're driving cost down in the mortgage servicing space.
So we've got dedicated teams behind everyone of those initiatives. I can’t tell you everyday everyone is exactly where it should be. But the vast majority of them just where want them to be kind of - I guess almost halfway through the year at this point.
So comfortable with the guidance we gave you and that will drive - we also gave a target that we drive this efficiency ratio down into the kind of the 50% range, 50% needs a little bit of kick-up in interest rates but just with expense, just with the expense saves will drive the efficiency rate down into the 53-ish 52, 53, plus or minus range.
So good progress, good momentum, probably just say not before we sat down we even go through with- you've heard Jamie talk about driving waste out of the company and the income is kind of black cars and so on.
We have gone through - so all of you who are on voicemail, it’s about 10 bucks a month for voice message - to have voice mail. And we realize that hardly anyone uses voicemail anymore, because it's so easy to – we are all carrying something in our pockets it’s going to get texts, or email or a phone call too and so we started to cut those off.
So we’re just going through meticulously looking at the expense statement driving out waste and dealing with the structural issues, the structural issues, which will permanently reduce the cost structure for the business.
Matt O'Connor
Probably here I'm not the only one whose voicemail already turned down, I have a follow-up question on expenses, but do want to give the audience a chance to ask the questions. If you have a question raise your hands, you'll get a mic and I’ll get you after that.
Just as we think about the expense efforts that you laid out and tied into the simplification plans that you talked about in Investor Day, I think there might have been a revenue component on the simplification in terms of and maybe getting out some stuff that you didn't want to be in?
Gordon Smith
All the work around simplification as it would affect revenue in any meaningful way is done. So for example, we make the decision to exit student lending, that had revenue implications. I think the simplification agenda will be with us for the next many years. And so we’ve cut for example the number of mortgage products that we offer more than in half that can service 97% of our customers needs.
So if you start to think about the consequences of that for mortgage banker training, retail banker training, technologists who have to build and document platforms, its very interesting, it is little bit I kind of drop in, drop oil on the surface of water, it just spreads and so again has a big impact on the structural expenses of the company.
And also our simplification agenda is really concentrated on making us easier to do business with the customer. So we will sit in meeting rooms across the country and looking at kind of model behavior of what a customer has to do to make a payment and whether it’s on a mobile device, whether it’s on desktop, we look at every single screen, every single click, every use of color, every use of white space to make it easier for the customer.
And so I’m really pleased about the simplification agenda but specifically don't expect that to be any meaningful impact from a negative perspective on revenue as we go forward from here.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
How do you assess the competitive threat of online marketplace lending and to the extent that you sense a competitive threat over the short, intermediate or longer term, what are you doing about it, how do you address that threat?
Gordon Smith
I think there are kind of two levels of threat, first I will mention the lending question specifically and then we will come back to what I will just call the user interface threat.
So in terms of the lending threat, there is nothing there at this stage that would cause - be a cause for concern for us. We will regularly tell our team that this is the most dangerous point in the credit cycle for all of the industry, why because credit performance is being good for so long and people become very comfortable in a good credit cycle and actually people come into the business and they don’t remember and doesn’t seem long ago for those of us who went through the pain of the downturn that people come in and they think, credit all you do is see improvements in role rates.
So I worry that some of the model, and they are very, very small, how well will they really shake out when you through a tough economy. So at this point I don’t see anything there that would cause us a concern.
The second piece which is a interesting piece of your question is, what I think of is kind of folks who have effectively are offering an interface layer between the bank and the customer and they don't want to hold the low, and they just want to charge kind of the toe along the way. And I think - actually what we’re learning from some of those folks is very creative work being done again simplification and innovation.
We obviously don’t want to see somebody sit between us and our end customer and so we will be bringing and are bringing our own improvements to market, so that there isn’t a need for that, but I do worry a little bit that there are organizations who want put a layer between us and our customer and it’s a very expensive job to acquire customers and to go through the anti-money laundering, know your customer, or the regulatory, an appropriate regulatory requirements that those people don’t do, so that's something that we keeping a close look at.
Matt O'Connor
So we covered a lot of topics in a short period of time. You cover and run a lot of businesses. Are there two or three points that you want us to think about as we leave this meeting?
Gordon Smith
I think and again I would go back to where we were in February and say that the guidance that we laid out across all of the businesses looks to be exactly the right guidance.
I think that the economy is steady and growing and that's encouraging. And I feel really pleased consumer community, banking is made up of six businesses in the time we had today, we really couldn't go through them all but I feel like they have great competitive position, they are all kind of one, two or three in that space.
If we look at Chase Paymentech, we didn't have a chance to talk about just see an accelerating growth as we go in through 2015. And I think the intense focus that we’ve had on the customer over this last many years and the distribution reach that we had, I feel very good about the progress we are making through 2015.
Matt O'Connor
Well, please join me in thanking Gordon and JPMorgan. Thank you very much.
Gordon Smith
Matt, thank you.
