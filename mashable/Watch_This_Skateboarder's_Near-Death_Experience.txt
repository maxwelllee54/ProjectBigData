Watch This Skateboarder's Near-Death Experience

If you're a skateboarder, the YouTube video above shows why you shouldn't bomb down steep hills that lead directly to busy cross streets. 
The young sk8r guy shown here nearly gets mowed down by a passing motorist, but thankfully is able to skid to a halt just in time and his board takes the blow alone. We think his friend's astounded explanation sums up the situation pretty well.
