Steve Tusa
Great, welcome everybody to our section of the J.P. Morgan Industrials and Transportation Conference. We are going to kick it off here with CEO of GE Capital, Rich Laxer. Before we do that, as far as tomorrow is concerned, we will be - there are a couple of companies that are obviously going to make it in, but we are going to be hosting as much as we can. I think we’ll get the majority done remotely. So, just be on the lookout for dial-in info and anything else that you need for one-on-ones, as well as some of these presentations will still be webcast. They will be obviously in communication with you guys about how we are going to end up tomorrow.
But with that, I’ll hand it up to Rich. Rich thanks for joining us.
Richard Laxer
Yeah, thanks for having us. Good morning. We’ll spend a few minutes today taking you through a highlight of GE Capital. We’ll start with an update on the GE Capital Exit Plan, the progress we are making. Talking about the new GE Capital, we are using our balance sheet to support our industrial company’s growth and lastly I’ll give you some thoughts on our framework for 2017 as I think about the company and our performance.
So, first on the highlights, from GE Capital Exit Plan April, 2015, we are basically a year ahead of plan, 93% of our transactions are closed. Last June we got out of third supervision, so we lost specific designation. We expect to get out of regulations in Europe in the first half of the year. Now, we’ve got some trailing activities that I’ll talk about that we need to wind down.
Since we announced the Exit Plan, we paid $47 billion of dividends, $5 billion ahead of what we thought we would be at this point. That includes the spin-off of Synchrony and we’ve got good momentum coming to this year. We paid $2 billion already of a dividend out of the six to seven that we project that we’ll pay in 2017.
GE Capital now is aligned with the industrials. Our businesses are in the business of supporting industrial growth. We’re working with our industrial businesses and our customers help drive orders for the company. I’ll talk more about that. And the go-forward business has a good financial profile. We are going to take our earnings and dividend out the parent company and basically balance of the company with investment levels around $80 billion. That’s an overview.
I’ll give you some update on Exit Plan. Going back to April 2015, we’ve sold 93% of the transactions. We’ve closed these deals. That’s ahead of plan. We thought we’ve closed it at the end of ‘17. We are mostly done at this point. And as I mentioned before, we’ve got some trailing activities basically agreements that we have with the buyers of our companies that will go through 2018.
The deal pricing on the transactions have come in where we expected about 1.1 time’s tangible book value and the cost of exiting these businesses are inside of the $23 billion we originally estimated. From a dividend standpoint, we paid $47 billion between the Synchrony and cash dividends. We’ll have 51 paid out by the end of this year and as I said we’ve repaid $2 billion so far this year and our capital levels and liquidity for the company remain very conservative and very strong.
There is what GE Capital looks like today. We're a key part of the GE store. As you probably read in the Annual Report, each year Jeff talked about how critical the GE store is to the entire company. The businesses take from the GE store and give back and GE Capital does the same. Our business exists to provide financial and intellectual support to our industrial businesses and their customers to help them grow.
Three key objectives, we wanted to help drive organic growth by structuring, advising, and creating products and market access for industrial businesses. We want to do good transactions that cover our cost to capital. I’ll talk more about that later and capital allocation is very important thing for us. We're going to manage GE Capital at the $80 billion level as I mentioned before. So, it's important that we do good deals that support the industrial company but also have access to the capital markets.
With a limited balance, it's very important that we have the ability to access other people's money to grow transactions that we’re the capital in the GE Store. Here is a picture of the businesses that we're in today. We remain in three key businesses, GECAS, our Aviation Services and Leasing business. We’re the number one lessor in the business. We’ve been in the business for a very long time. I'll talk more about that in a few minutes.
And about 85% of the fleet that we own and manage is powered by GE engines. Our Energy Financial business is working very closely with our power, renewable, oil and gas businesses to drive equipment pull-through by getting involved in transactions very early to help drive sales. And our Industrial Finance business does mid-ticket equipment finance deals and helps to work in capital management.
These businesses in 2016 delivered $1.9 billion in earnings. We're going to manage the business, as I mentioned, at about an $80 billion investment level and we're going to do transactions that cover our cost to capital around 13% return on tangible equity and global capital markets will be critical as I mentioned as we manage the business at a stable investment level.
So a couple of pictures and stories and background on the individual businesses themselves, starting with GECAS. This is a business with some deep domain expertise, a team that's managed through many cycles and delivered consistent earning through those cycles. We've been in the business for 50 years. Last year the team was recognized as the leading global leasing company in the space by Airline Economics.
We've got a large and diverse asset base. We own or manage 1500 planes, 2000 assets in total and we have a broad product offering, mostly doing leasing but also the capacity to do that as well. When you think about how GECAS fits into the GE Store, we work on new product campaigns and work with our customers and GE Aviation to bring GE equipment into their businesses.
Eighty five percent roughly of our portfolio is powered by GE engines. We've got relationships around the world. We've got people in in 25 cities and access to 100 markets and we have close to 300 customers around the world. That's key, because it gives us access to markets and people and also the ability to redeploy planes as they come back.
And we have an unique advantage knowledge now and we have deep domain expertise within our team, longstanding relationships and experience within aviation, but the connection with GE Aviation gives us a real competitive advantage over our competition. So, the GE Store in action and we’ve got a few pages for each business examples of transactions that we've done.
Here is a transaction that we do with AirAsia. This is one of the best low cost carriers in the world. We help deliver five Airbus 320 NEOs, one of our first in Asia. Not only were we able to deliver product to this customer but working across their fleet, we were able to deliver more GE engines and provide more of a comprehensive solution beyond just financing.
Energy Finances, this is our global structure. Finance business does project finance deals around the world, supporting our renewables business, oil and gas, power thermal, we've got a strong origination capacity and team very experienced in all phases of transaction from development, construction through operation. We're in 16 countries but have access to over 100 supporting our industrial parent.
We do investments across the capital structure and also not only provide capital but also rise and distribute capital. This business, as you think about where they fit in the GE Store, has pivoted over the last few years. Now, 90% of the investment they do involves GE equipment. They're integrated into the deal cycle. They work side by side with our industrial businesses. So, when a transaction starts, they can be involved.
We have both the technical knowledge and the financial capability working together to bring a solution for our customers. We've got deep market knowledge and credibility and we've got strong relationships with other providers to capital, which is critical in project finance. Strong relationships with ECAs, DFIs, people that help make transactions happen around the world.
GE Store in action for Energy Financial Services, there was a power auction in Argentina. Our team worked with the industrial businesses from the beginning with two local very strong partners to help deliver GE equipment. We won 50% of the auction. And as you can see from the chart, it delivered a lot of GE equipment into the transaction.
Our Industrial Financial Services business helps drive orders through mid-ticket leasing and also helps GE with its working capital management. With our capabilities in over 50 countries, we do diverse product offering mostly leasing but also financing as well and we enable orders and cash flow for the company. The GE Store in action we're expanding our capability here.
Historically we've focused on supporting the health care equipment business. But now we're working also with oil and gas, renewables, transportation, as well as additives. We've got direct origination capabilities and we work with the industrials to help them maximize their cash flow and their collections.
GE Store in action, as a transaction we did for Romo [ph] in Brazil and helped deliver 16 locomotives with a U.S. denominated cross border transaction and deliver GE equipments one important deal and helped upgrade a fleet to this customer. Capital markets are critical to what we do.
As I mentioned we're going to keep the investment level for the company around $80 billion. It allows us to dividend out the earnings that we make. But in doing that we've got to have access to other people's money and this is critical. Last year we helped the industrials drive $13 billion of orders both using our own balance sheet but also using other people's money as you can see from the chart, $5 billion.
We've got relationships with export credit agencies, ECAs, around the world. That gives us $50 billion of capacity. We almost doubled that last year by adding 10 new ECAs to our portfolio. And as you can see on the right-hand side of the chart, we enabled orders and equipment orders in key markets. This is where we used other people's money as well as our own and we had a significant impact on GE's orders in those markets.
So, as we look at 2017, I’ll first start with 2016, ‘16 was a particularly strong year for the verticals delivering $1.9 billion of net income. That was a little ahead of where we thought we'd be. And some key transactions that we had closed earlier than we expected, Other Continuing which is excess interest, our preferred cost, these are costs that are related to running the businesses but not in the actual verticals with $3.1 billion that number is coming down but still negative and it left us with $1.3 billion loss for capital in 2016.
We ended the year with about $82 billion and we dividend out $20 billion, which is $2 billion ahead of what our plan was. As we think about ‘17, we expect another strong year from the verticals. We expect it to be roughly less than last year in large part because of the transactions that I mentioned that closed earlier than we expected. We're making significant progress on other continuing.
That number is going to be down year-over-year. We’ll still be negative. And overall we see capital being positive on the net income line for 2017. We ended the year with about $80 billion of investment. And dividends, as I mentioned before, will be six to seven to which we've already paid. So, the verticals continue to be strong delivery on net income. We're doing a lot with the balance sheet to lessen the cost of the excess debt.
The excess debt exists simply because we sold faster than we expected. So, the assets went before the debt and obviously that creates a bit of a drag. We're working to do that and we continue to deliver on our dividend commitments ahead of schedule and on track of what we promised.
So, overall that's where we are, successful portfolio transformation. GE Capital Exit Plan is ahead of plan. We're returning capital faster than we expected and there is a strong strategic connection between GE Capital and Industrial businesses that we support.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Steve Tusa
Great, I think we’ll just kick it off with the last slide you gave on the guidance, the last official kind of net income or pro forma income guidance I think you guys gave was back at another competitor conference last June where you had 2018 of about $1.4 billion, you obviously outperformed that last year. You are going to outperform it again this year. What's the difference between those two numbers and the run-rate you’re at today and then maybe just give us an update on where that 1.4 kind of goes to? It would seem that’s an upward pressure on that at this stage.
Richard Laxer
Well, I think it’s hard to predict - so I think it’s hard to predict that, Steve, into 2018. I think what we've laid out is the framework of about an $80 billion investment level. We see the verticals this year with a strong performance in the range we were last year, but inside that slightly because of some of the gains that came in. I think where you’ll see real progress is in other continuing.
That's where we have our excess debt, preferred costs, those numbers continue to come down. We expect to be out of the excess debt by 2019, the preferred by 2021 when they're callable. So, we see that line comes down. And so I think it's hard to predict out, but right now we are comfortable with a framework we have today.
Steve Tusa
And what is the difference between kind of the 1.4 billion and what you've done? You talked about transactions closing earlier than expected. Maybe what types of transactions are those that…?
Richard Laxer
The transactions are - we're constantly in the market within our energy business and our aviation business, selling investments. So, there we just had some investments that originally we thought would close in the first quarter of 2017. It actually closed in 2016. So, I think when you look at the vertical earnings, I think kind of a flat trajectory is reasonable.
Steve Tusa
Going forward. Okay. And then when do you expect - are you on track for the Other Continuing ops numbers relative to what you had planned on the breakup for the sale of GE Capital? Are all those kind of below the line items on track for what you had guided to back then? Is there any change there? And then when we flip back to reporting, kind of the pro forma number goes away and we start to just look at the kind of all-in continuing ops number?
Richard Laxer
So two questions, on the first question, we continue to work the Other Continuing line. What’s in Other Continuing, as I mentioned, are our cost around excess debt that's a function of the fact that we sold that in excess than we thought, but the debt has maturities that are still there. The preferred which I mentioned [indiscernible] 2021 and the other costs to run the business that are in the verticals.
I’ll get to the second question. So, we're making good progress there. Since 2015, we've taken action around our alternative funding to the tune of about $41 billion. We do the debt exchange where it makes sense. We just did a tender and some hybrid for ‘17 where we had 84% tick-up, so we’re economical and continue to work out.
So the Other Continuing continues to come down. And once you get to ‘18, really only two things that are remaining there are the excess interest costs and the cost of the preferred. In terms of the second part, in terms of how we talk about the company, the reason why we split out Other Continuing from the verticals was to give people transparency around how the verticals are performing. And so, again, that will become - Other Continuing will be lower numbers at ‘18, ‘19 once preferred or rather the excess interest rolls off and excess debt goes away.
Steve Tusa
And that ultimately goes to zero in kind of 2020 time period from a cash earnings perspective? Do they kind of all emerge into this - the 1.8 base today, which may be higher or lower at that stage of the game?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, that will be a main cause. So, when you get to ‘19, by the end of ‘19, all the excess debt associated with the assets that are being run off will be gone and then the only thing you have outstanding at that point, you're pretty much at your steady state capital structure. The only thing you have outstanding at that point is the preferred and the preferred isn’t callable until 2021. So, really that's the only significant item at this point.
Steve Tusa
That’s it. Okay. That makes a ton of sense and I would assume you'd kind of go back to reporting it as one line item at that stage kind of the 2021?
Richard Laxer
Again materially that will number will go down overtime.
Steve Tusa
Yeah, okay. Can you also talk about looking out to beyond this wind-down which you guys have by the way done a fantastic job on executing. That kind of left over $14 billion tangible equity number that was put out there back when you announced. Is that still around kind of the right pro forma number that you're expecting to have left over on the balance sheet when all said and done?
Richard Laxer
That’s exactly right. If you look at the capital structure we talked about back then around $70 billion of debt, $14 billion of tangible equity, we then were around $20 billion of liquidity. I think now to space than we’re probably more like 10 or 15, so I think that's a fair structure and then kind of a TE to TA ratio of 12%. If you look at other industrial finance companies, they're probably in the nine to eleven range, but we're going to probably end up is around 12%.
Steve Tusa
Okay. And then just one other kind of check the box item on getting an update on the trajectory, $10 billion of dividends left over six to seven this year, is that kind of the right number for ‘18 three to three and a half depending on what you get done this year?
Richard Laxer
Yeah. So I think - yeah, so what I think about it is we paid up until this year $24.4 billion, you add in the $2 billion that we've already paid this quarter, which is $26.4 billion. By the end of this year, it will be $31 billion. Now when we talk about in 2015 we said that about $31 billion of dividends would come from the sale of the assets and that's roughly what you see there and the rest would come from earnings from the assets that we kept, the release of capital et cetera. I think the - so the 31 is on track by the end of this year in terms of the 35 as Jeff mentioned at the outlook meeting in December, will probably be inside of that number because we sold a lot faster than we expected.
Steve Tusa
Right, right. Okay. So, no change there?
Richard Laxer
No, change there.
Steve Tusa
The receivables factoring that you guys do to kind of help GE industrial, the industrial finance business, can you maybe talk about how you make that - how do you make decision to take them off GE’s balance sheet and on the other side why would they kind of keep some there? What's sort of the high level trigger point for that?
Richard Laxer
So, we do two things really for GE. We've got a collection COE, but we do collections on 75% of GE's receivables and we also do factoring for them as well. And the factoring makes sense for a lot of these. One is on an arm's length basis. So, they pay both of the collections services, as well as refinancing on the receivables. And then in portfolios what you would expect given the kind of deals we do size geography et cetera, mostly in North America and in Europe.
And so you think about it, we've got a collection COE arm's length kind of makes sense from a cost standpoint and income standpoint to keep those earnings inside the firm and then we've done this for a long time. It's a very stable business. Right now, when you look at delinquencies in that portfolio mid-single digit, very strong performance, so these are good receivables. Sometimes we’ll sell some off for risk management purposes. So, that’s a good way for us to leverage our collection COE and we have about $12 billion of outstanding in that space.
Steve Tusa
And I guess half of those are recourse to GE. I think it wasn't in the 10-K. Is that just kind of a normal agreement when you think about factoring with third-parties as well?
Richard Laxer
It’s we’re going on a transaction by transaction basis and the risk of each one.
Steve Tusa
Okay, okay. Stepping back to earnings, I had one more follow-up, which I didn’t ask. What are the - when you look at that kind of $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion number, what are the amount of gains and impairments embedded in that number, obviously, they’re all field set towards each year. How should we think about kind of that level of run rate earnings based on just clipping the coupon and also the gains and the impairments?
Richard Laxer
In 2016, the gains probably outpaced the marks and impairments by about two to one up to a couple of hundred million dollars roughly and that reflects a good market that’s selling to and we're going to continue to sell as we see opportunities in our energy and aviation leasing business and also a pretty good stabilized market, oil and gas, pretty strong, so we are going to take advantage of the sell side. So, I think marks and environment a couple of hundred million better to the good.
Steve Tusa
Right and some of that comes off a bit in kind of the ‘17 time period. Getting back to this relationship between you guys and GE industrial, maybe you could talk about a couple of more examples of successful ventures between the two, the two of you mentioned a couple on the slide there, but maybe a little more on how that sausage is made and are you all going into the room together to bid on these things or they go in and then you kind of come in after them, how does that typically work?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I think what we've done in all the businesses is create a very strong relationship with the industrial teams whether it would be in aviation, whether it would be in energy, whether it would be mid-ticket equipment, especially for the larger more structured transactions, we involve very early. So, if you think about the project finance deals in energy, it's very important that we’re in the room day one. They bring the technical knowledge. We bring the financing capital markets advisory capability.
So, we've got a better chance as you think back to the Argentina example I mentioned earlier on the fast power deal. We get a better chance to win if we are there together. So, we're embedded in their deal prophecies. We’re calling the customers. That gives us a better chance of winning, especially in some of these markets we're financing stuff. The fact that we can bring both the technical equipment solution, as well as the financial one gives us a real advantage.
Steve Tusa
Can you maybe talk about your kind of ambitions to grow that book? How fast - is it a couple of billion dollars a year for the receivable side and then the deals that you're actually financing growing faster? What are kind of the ambitions to grow the industrial finance part of business?
Richard Laxer
Well, I think the - from a growth standpoint, as I mentioned a couple of times earlier, we're going to keep the balance sheet where it is today at around $80 billion. So, to the extent that the company grows faster, it's going to mean we're going to have to access the capital markets more because we want to keep the investment level, the equity in the company, the dividends flowing where they're going.
In terms of industrial finance really we're expanding that world to go beyond health care where it's been historically, do things for oil and gas, renewables, others, in the mid-ticket market we're rebuilding our capability in Europe and actually looking at China for health care. And so, I think we’ll grow in line with how the industrials grow. So, the balance sheet has been maintained at the same level.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Yeah, I am getting to that point around the balance sheet. How should we think about the - beyond the asset sales, how the dividends begin to kind of flow back to GE right now, obviously you're not making much kind of true cash earnings, so over the next couple of years how do we think about kind of the dividend run rate, let's say, adding kind of the - I don't know beyond maybe ‘19 and ‘20 time period, is that continuing ops number begins to go positive and merge with the pro forma number?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I think, Steve, we are keeping the balance sheet and the investment level flat. All the earnings will be available for dividends.
Steve Tusa
Okay. So, whatever you are on a continuing ops basis, it goes back to the -
Richard Laxer
Strategy, yeah, for each one [ph].
Steve Tusa
Okay, got it. Maybe if anybody has any questions around kind of the high level, I am going to dive into the verticals here and talk a bit about the businesses and we have questions about the asset sales capital structure kind of more of the corporate high level stuff for GE Capital. Thank you. I can repeat the question too if it doesn’t work.
Unidentified Speaker
[indiscernible]
Steve Tusa
The question is what is the extra interest that you're paying on the debt overhang from GE Capital along with the preferred?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I think in ‘16 it was around 400 in excess interest and probably we went through 400 on the preferred as well, 100 plus or minus in there.
Unidentified Speaker
[indiscernible]
Richard Laxer
You got the tax and then you got restructuring charges. You also have OpEx cost to run the businesses that we’re running off is in there as well.
Steve Tusa
And that obviously will be restructured away.
Richard Laxer
That’ll be restructured away the numbers is away. Also, running off, if you think about Other Continuing, a couple of years we had the billion dollars of cost in there for regulation. However, we’re part of the segue to build up an entire infrastructure for that and that number is going to be gone completely, but that's part of what's in there.
Unidentified Speaker
[indiscernible]
Richard Laxer
Between us and GE, yes.
Steve Tusa
Well, there are also some third-party agreements, yeah.
Richard Laxer
We’ll do some secondary sales. You normally suspect that people buy receivables in the market, I don’t have the names off the top of my head.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Digging into GECAS a little bit here, you talked about at Investor Conference recently about kind of reducing that asset base over time. Can you maybe just talk about where you stand on that front?
Richard Laxer
I think first and foremost, I mean, GECAS is a leading provider in space number one and most of the recognition they got last year. That’s a very important business, so we're going to continue to run that franchise in a strong way and continue to do the origination at the level that we're doing it. ENI roughly of $38 billion right now, we've targeted by the end of year maybe $36 billion, so kind of a tight range but the extent that we do that obviously that will have an impact on earnings. Less investment means slightly less earnings, but we're going to manage it within that range.
Steve Tusa
Okay. And your narrow-body fleet last year declined pretty significantly $22 billion to $18 billion. Can you maybe talk about what the driver of that was when the mix is there?
Richard Laxer
That's really investing in planes with GEnx and LEAP engines. That was really the main driver, so with our engines in wide-body planes.
Steve Tusa
Got it and then the engine number went up.
Richard Laxer
Yeah.
Steve Tusa
So, is that kind of the mix impact of legacy stuff rolling off and you taking on more new stuff, so you have to bring on spare engines? Is that…?
Richard Laxer
It’s not spare engines. We just did some 777s and 787s, which had those engines.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Got it.
Richard Laxer
That’s what really drove the mix, but by and large our order book going forward has a higher component of narrow-bodies and wide-bodies.
Steve Tusa
Okay. Can you maybe talk about the interaction between the leasing arm and the engine business? Is there - are there transactions exclusive of the actual airplanes you guys are buying? How much competitor engine content do you kind of deal in? Maybe just talk about the engine.
Richard Laxer
The relationship with aviation is very strong. I think again this gives us a unique advantage against the other leasing companies in the fact that we've got the industrial aviation business as well as the leasing arm. About 85%, I think I have it in one of those slides, of our planes are powered by GE engines, so that's the majority of what we do. In other instances, we might do some planes for GE customers with the whole point to obviously bring them and I think we've had a good track record over time as people upgrade their fleets bringing GE aviation as the plane to what they were in before.
Steve Tusa
When you look at the helicopter business you bought a couple of years ago, the assets there have actually gone up. I would have thought that maybe the value of the collateral there, perhaps declined with a very tough helicopter market, small part of your business, but maybe talk about what you're seeing there. I know that it was highlighted as a potential for a goodwill issue a quarter ago, but I didn't see that in the 10 - it’s all kind of removed from the 10-K. So, maybe just talk about the value of the helicopter assets and what's happening there - small part of the business?
Richard Laxer
Sure. So, in terms of the increase that really reflects expanding the business strategy, those assets that drove that increase were in the emergency medical services space and so that was a big deal. And also they are dealing with GECAS. It’s been historically - as the market turns, [indiscernible] some very attractive lending to support their customers. And so, smaller part of the overall asset base, but I think the business performed pretty well last year given the tough market they were in.
Steve Tusa
They are doubling down in kind of these -
Richard Laxer
We think doubling down.
Steve Tusa
Yeah, yeah.
Richard Laxer
I would say that doing smart investing to support businesses have attractive returns and you think about the history of GECAS they deliver consistent earnings through many cycles and the ability to length through a cycle is always helped us.
Steve Tusa
And any other questions on a GECAS?
Unidentified Analyst
What’s your hit rate typically, GE Engine [indiscernible]
Steve Tusa
The question is hit rate on the GE Engine winning 80% to 90%, what’s the number - your hit rate on those deals?
Richard Laxer
You mean for GE engines competing with an airline or GE Capital trying to lease one of those planes?
Unidentified Analyst
GE Cap.
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I don’t have that number one and I'll get back to you about that on, I hadn’t thought about that one.
Steve Tusa
Any risk around the - I guess one last question for me, any risk around the - on the wide-bodies, as far as impairments are concerned obviously it's a tougher market, I think you maybe worked through that in the last couple of years.
Richard Laxer
Yeah, the team continuously updates our valuations to check for marks and impairments. I think we've done a good job on the portfolio as you look at our order book going forward skewed very much towards narrow-bodies versus wide bodies, so that's something that we constantly look at and update.
Steve Tusa
And is there any reason why you guys, why GECAS would be leveraged any differently than peers out there? Is there - do you have an ability to maybe be a little bit more aggressive on leverage of GE Capital given the diversified nature and obviously the relationship with GE Industrial?
Richard Laxer
We are a leverage less than our competitors, I mean we're comfortable where the leverage is for GECAS and where the leverage is for the company overall, so it’s not something we've looked at.
Steve Tusa
Okay, on ESS, can you maybe just talk about the business model there, any risks or growth opportunities that you see and is the - what's kind of the right run rate for earning there? It’s going to be a little bit lumpy over -
Richard Laxer
I think it would be less lumpy given the way we've designed the business at this point, but the risk in energy and project finance are obviously around policy, market risk with interest rates pricing in oil and gas. A lot of some of the risk in some instances is as you go into emerging markets, rule of law, our ability to plug in your collateral, so we spent a lot of time working upfront with DFIs and others to make sure that there's capital there and there's sovereign support to do the things you want to do and so I think we manage that book pretty well. I think it’s why also, when you look at the chart I had a few pages back there were really leveraging capital markets especially for the markets that we haven't been in historically, it helps to have the investors from those markets, the DCAs and others to support those transactions.

What is that - when you look at that asset base, what is kind of a high level breakout when you think about the various industries that you're dealing in there? I know there's oil and gas and I know there’s power in there, what else - kind of how does that pie chart break out when you think about the end market of the assets, the exposure?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, right now the largest areas is in renewables, thermal second and oil and gas, we knew exactly when you are going with the high level.
Steve Tusa
Any other questions on ESS, and the business model there is generally more longer term investment as opposed to where you're investing in and then you're selling an asset and you're booking again or taking the cash off the table as opposed to something that’s a little more straightforward kind of lending and leasing, little more transaction based.
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I think that mode has changed, as I talk of the team has pivoted thoughts, today 90% of what they do is with GE Equipment. If you go back three or four years ago it was probably 50/50 and that was playing more of a transactional type businesses that you mentioned. I think you're looking at probably longer mid-term investments because you’re going through the whole cycle of the transaction, so it’s going to less of a short-term thing, so I think from that you should see steadier earnings.
Steve Tusa
Right, so the industrial solutions that you talk about include what you're doing at ESS, it's not just the working capital solutions, it’s of the other side of the coin. Okay, when you're looking at that industrial solutions business and you're kind of going out in different end markets verticals like food and beverage in those types of things, maybe talk about that growth opportunity and where you are in that. I know our friend Trevor Schomberg was -
Richard Laxer
Did a great job.
Steve Tusa
Yeah, he did a great job, that’s been better in his role, but Trevor did a great job. So maybe talk about the exposure, what's your biggest vertical, fastest growing, what you’re most excited about there?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, I think our biggest vertical remains health care equipment. We've had a strong relationship with healthcare business in leasing for a very long time. We've really increased recently with Trevor's efforts around our business in North America and Canada, we've seen attractive growth there and we've also spent some time last year, so expanding our capabilities in Europe because we sold the businesses that supported some of the infrastructure and we rebuilt that. In healthcare also as I mentioned, we look at some opportunities in China for some for some equipment finance. The healthcare is the largest and will remain the largest. Some of the new areas that we're excited about is, we now have the ability to come in not only to so the equipment provide financing I think for David Joyce and his team that's very attractive we were done some transactions. I think from the new standpoint that’s a very exciting vertical where we think there’s a potential for lot of business. We're also looking at equipment deals or sort of the transportation deal we did for Romo [ph]that was an attractive deal. We like some opportunities in oil and gas. I think the mid ticket equipment is an attractive space for us and we're going to expand our capabilities and grow that space.
Steve Tusa
What are you seeing out there when you touch all these verticals? What are your customers telling you about Trump and duty as a Marine is other stuff that's going on out there, I mean there seems to be optimism but not necessarily, something that's feeding through yet maybe I think you can talk about what your customers are telling?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, avoid the political commentary, I think when you look at the different markets, the U.S. economy feels strong and you see that and we see that in terms of the activity that’s coming across. In Europe things were better particularly in Germany and Spain driving Europe and then secondly I think actually we've seen some improvement in France and Italy, so I think it's market-by-market, but we are seeing in general strong economy that's driving equipment sale.
Steve Tusa
And then just lastly for me on kind of disc ops basis, the insurance liabilities, what's kind of the plan - anything planed there or you just kind of run that down over an extended period of time, not something that’s talked about a lot, but it's relatively sizable.
Richard Laxer
Yeah, those are dated assets and given the interest rate environment we're in right now it's not attractive to do something. We always look at it, but just given where rates are at this point it's not an attractive exit.
Steve Tusa
No material exit options there?
Richard Laxer
No, not at this point.
Steve Tusa
Any other questions for Rich? Ann? We got a few minutes, so ago on
Unidentified Analyst
The specifics that is on your comments, on the opportunities in additive, could you just talk a little bit more about that? Is that presumes additive manufacturing interest for the opportunity?
Richard Laxer
Yeah, the equipment, doing the equipment finance, so basically bringing the technology, the structures, the kind of financing that we do across our equipment leasing businesses and bring that to additive. And I think it's going to attract a very, very strong pipeline and we've done a couple deals and so it's financing the equipment.
Unidentified Analyst
Regarding the insurance liabilities, you mentioned that it was because the rate environment are attractive to look at a solution now, what sort of BoE [ph] level would you think you'd have to see in terms of the rate environment to consider that transaction where the bid comes?
Richard Laxer
I think there's a lot of factors there, so it’s hard to give you a specific number, but we would like to see a few increases before that would be attractive. It’s a Start.
Steve Tusa
Any other questions?
Unidentified Analyst
Just two questions, one, what are the implications to GE Capital strategy in the event of large portfolio changed in GE, so if for example healthcare is not part of GE Industrial, is the expectation that GE Capital will not have that? And secondly, could you just explain what drives that 1% to 2% incremental growth or the slide that you noted of GE Capital, does this just pertain to just more attractive financing terms or lease terms on GE Equipment and that's helping shift the strategy to more GE Equipment rather than competitors? Thank you.
Richard Laxer
So the first one id hard to answer, we're supporting the businesses that we have and I think continue to do that. And as we bring in new businesses like Baker Hughes as part of oil and gas transaction that we announced last year, that will create opportunity for us, so we're going to continue to support the businesses we have. The 1% to 2% really is our aspiration of helping GE reach its organic growth targets and so like your comment about attractive financing, we’re going to offer market rates and market transactions and so where we help create a victory for the company is by coming with a comprehensive solution with the equipment sale as well as the financing capability.
Steve Tusa
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Richard Laxer
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
