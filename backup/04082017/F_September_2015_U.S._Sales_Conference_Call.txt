Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Call. My name is Jasmine, I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Erich Merkle. Please proceed.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Jasmine, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to Ford’s September 2015 sales call. Today, I’m joined here with Mark LaNeve, Ford’s Vice President of U.S. Marketing Sales and Service; and Yong Yang, Ford’s Senior U.S. Economist.
Jumping right into the numbers after reviewing this morning’s early data, we estimate total industry sales, including medium and heavy trucks are coming in at about 1.3 million to maybe just a little over 1.4 million units in that range for September. This would translate into an industry SAAR that we would expect to be around 18 million, again, that would include medium and heavy vehicles. This would mean that then the total vehicle industry, including medium and heavy trucks was likely up about 13% in September, while the month benefited from a strong Labor Day weekend sales, which were not included in September 2014 results. We view the September’s industry performance as another strong sales month.
The sales mix for September appears to be approximately 84% retail and 16% fleet. So if we take a look at some of the segment trends that we saw for the month looking at the growth in small utilities it just continues with about 20% of the overall industry now for the month of September is comprised of the small utilities. Last year we mentioned that the small utility segment would overtake the largest segment at the time which was small cars. This clearly happened in September with small utilities producing a 2 point increase versus last year’s 18% of the industry.
The small car segment dropped to about 18% of the industry by more than 2 point decrease from a year ago. Midsize cars also saw some losses, as they represented approximately 13.6% of the industry last month, compared to 14.3% in 2014. Full-size pickups, as I know a lot of you’re very interested in, continued to show strength. Full-size pickups represented about 13.3% of industry last month, which was up 0.4 of a point sequentially and compares favorably to a strong 13% last year.
So with that in mind, we’re going to take a closer look and take a – look at Ford and Lincoln. And for that, I’m going to turn things over to Mark LaNeve. Mark?
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, Erich, and good morning, everyone. We had a very strong sales month at Ford Motor Company in September with sales totaling 221,599 vehicles, providing us with a 23% increase in September year-on-year. That increase was driven by retail. Our retail sales were 168,522. It was also a 23% increase year-over-year and really came across our entire portfolio, cars, SUVs, and trucks, let me give you a little texture behind that.
Our passenger car portfolio was up 15% at retail for September. Our SUV portfolio was up 23% at retail. F-Series in total was up 28% retail with F-150 specifically up 31%. And the new Transit van, you get a lot of mix between fleet and commercial in the van business, but at a pure retail basis, the new Transit was up 238%, which helped drive our van portfolio up 86%. So we had very good broad-based performance. Not only our new products outpacing the overall market again this month, but in addition to the sales performance, we really had outstanding transactional price performance, we’re up $620 across the entire portfolio on a transactional basis compared to August, so month-on-month, and more than $1,600 per vehicle year-on-year. These increases represents the largest increase in both cases, month-on-month, year-on-year of any of the full-line automakers for the month of September.
So overall, September actually capped off a strong Q3. For the quarter for Q3 our sales totaled 678,567, up 10% year-over-year and it was our best third quarter sales performance since 2006. Also worth noting in the numbers, sales of our EcoBoost-equipped vehicles totaled 733,000 through September, that’s 45% higher for EcoBoost-equipped vehicles than the same period of time last year, so say through first nine months of last year, and actually set a record for EcoBoost sales in a calendar year, and we still have three months left in the year, so we continue to get absolutely a great consumer acceptance of our EcoBoost technology.
Now a look at some specific vehicle highlights, we can dig in a little bit. On F-Series, we gained 2 points of retail share in September, and that’s actually that share level is higher than what we saw prior to the F-150 plan changeovers, which began last year. We did 69,651 F-Series sales in September, so almost at that 70,000 unit level for the second straight month just missed it.
At that level, overall F-Series were up 16%, and as I mentioned 28% retail, also had solid average transaction price improvements were up $2,100 year-over-year. And as I mentioned, we did 70,000 in August, almost 70,000 in September, that number is always a good barometer of great demand in a healthy truck business.
During the third quarter, F-Series totaled 207,271, that was up 8% versus the same period a year ago and represents the best third quarter F-Series sales performance since 2006, so a very, very solid month in quarter for F-Series and the new F-150. SUVs are hot and Ford brand SUVs, we had our best September since 2003 with 64,205 vehicles sold, represents a 27% increase in overall SUV sales for the month boosted by strong sales of our core products, including Escape, the all-new Edge, and the new Explorer. Edge turned in a record September sales performance with 28,473 units sold excuse me the Escape did that. And the all new Edge posted a 33% sales increase.
We’re still getting up the full availability turning incredibly quickly it’s sitting on dealers lots just 22 days are the new Explorers white-hot with 38% gain over a year ago turning it to 17 days with new high end platinum are the top of on line turning in just 9 days.
So, dealers did a really fantastic job of turning inventory incredibly quickly during the month. On our Van business we continue to see great momentum as I mentioned Van sales rose 86% for the month with 17,994 sold. Our best September Van performance since 1987 obviously this is driven by our all-new Transit, which equips 10,000 in fact we did 10,154 Transits for the month. When you look at those numbers it equates to Ford having about a 60% share of the commercial Van market so far this year.
Number one selling brand of commercial Vans in 47 states across the country. So we truly have a class leading product with the new Transit. And now our customers love the customization whether the retail or commercial buyers as it comes in 58 different configurations, different wheelbase/roof heights window seating configurations. And we’re able to really dig in and meet the very specific needs specific needs of our retail and commercial buyers. Our car business was strong at September with Ford brand car sales totaling 660,739, 60739. Again our best September sales performance since 2006 Mustang was unbelievable turned in a 199% increase in sales for the month.
Total sales of 9,456 Mustangs represent the pony car’s best September performance since 2007. and Lincoln had another very, very strong month Lincoln sales for the month were 8680 a 20% lift in sales with increases coming on every single Lincoln vehicles it represents Lincoln’s best September performance since 2007 so we continue to run the play with Lincoln and getting momentum every single month. Seeing strong growth in the luxury SUV business there as well and Lincoln contributed to that obviously. Lincoln SUV sales increased 23% last month with 5687units sold, represents Lincoln’s best SUV sales months since 2003. Lincoln MTC sales were up 16% with the all new MKX sales totaling 2136 vehicles that’s a 34% increase over year ago for the all new X out of what I can tell you was very tight inventories as we’re just ramping up availability.
The MKX turned in 19 days on dealer lots and continues to be in tight supply and we’re getting incredible customer and dealer a reception of the product and we think there’s upside as we get the full availability and get a better level of stock up there.
So to summarize lot of comparisons to 2005, 2006 across much of our portfolio so best month or best September frankly and roughly a decade strong performance up and down a line up. It looks like a great month for the industry and an exceptional month for Ford and, it was also coupled obviously that sales performance in our case with excellent price performance.
So capped off a very good quarter and sets us up well for Q4 so with that to look at it from an economic front I’d like to turn over to Yong. Yong.
Yong Yang
Okay, thanks Mark, good morning everyone. September U.S. economic data remained largely positive suggesting the U.S. economy continue to perform well, despite a recent volatility in the financial market. U.S. second quarter economic growth was revised up further in the final estimate, personal income and a spending on track to post strong growth in the third quarter. The labor market improvement remained steady.
The housing market continued its momentum, consumer confidence eased and stayed above historical average. Here are some additional details, the final estimate of the second quarter GDP indicates that the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.9% annualized rate, revised up from the 3.7% in their second estimate. Consumer spending was robust, growing at a 3.6% annualized rate from the prior quarter, up from 1.7% from the – in the first quarter. Business investment also gained a momentum increasing at a 4.1% annualized rate, up from 1.6% in the first quarter.
The second quarter GDP data also reveals that the change in inventory remained elevated at $114 million, albeit revised down from the second estimate. Expected inventory reduction will subtract from third quarter GDP growth. That said, higher frequency, consumer income and spending data are shaping up favorably for the third quarter. In August, real consumer disposable income grew 0.3% from the prior month, slightly down from 0.4% in July.
Real consumer spending grew 0.4% from the prior month, slightly up from 0.3% in July. These indexes suggests that consumer spending growth will likely come in at a more than 3% annualized rate for the third quarter. That will provide a strong support for overall economic growth for third quarter. In August, job gains moderated to 173,000, somewhat below expectations. This weaker rating coming in only after strong job gains in the prior three months, averaging about 250,000. Therefore, this weaker rating is not a sign of a softening labor market, it’s that the unemployment rate reached a historical low of 5.1% in August. The most recent four-week moving average jobless claims were 271,000, essentially unchanged from a month ago.
So we expect that the labor market will continue to improve at a steady pace. The housing market in August continued its momentum in recent months. Although housing starts fell 3% from the prior month they remained above the 1 million mark and up 16.6% from a year ago. Housing permits rose 3.5% from the prior month or 12.5%from a year ago, recovering from a decline in the prior month due to the expected expiration of a New York tax exemption program. The home sales increased 5.7% from the prior month, following a strong growth of 12% in July. So overall, the housing market remains on a favorable upward trajectory. And on the consumer spending the improving housing market will likely underpin the third quarter GDP growth.
In September, financial market and volatility continued to negatively impact consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment declined 4.7 points from the prior month to 87.2. Despite the easing, consumer sentiment remains above its historical average of 85.7 since the 1950s. The vehicle buying assessment were also positive with a 65% of consumers citing now as a good time to buy a vehicle. To recap, as Erich mentioned earlier, September total monthly sales were estimated in the 18 million range. This illustrates the underlying strength of our industry with the year-to-date industry SAAR averaging 17.6 million, we expect 2015 industry sales to come in at a upper end of our 17 million to 17.5 million range, including medium and heavy trucks.
With that summary, let me turn it back to Erich. Erich?
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Yang. We’re going to take care of some housekeeping items right now. And so we’re going to take a look at our fleet for the month of September, as a percentage of our total sales. So if we look at September of 2015, fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 24%. Given you the breakdown 10% commercial, 5% was government, and 9% was daily rental. Taking a look and comparing that September 2014. Fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 24%, 11% was commercial, 6% was government, and 7% was daily rental.
Taking a look at calendar year-to-date fleet, as a percentage of our total sales through September 2015. Fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 28%, that’s 12% for commercial, 5% for government and 11% for daily rental, comparing that to the same period a year ago our January to September 2014 fleet as a percentage of our total sales was 29%, 13% for commercial, 6% for government, and 10% for daily rental. And that the last housekeeping item here is our gross stock, and our inventory here for the month. So for the month of September 2015, we had 170,000 cars, 292,000 trucks, 137,000 SUVs giving us a total in gross stock of 599,000 vehicles translating into 68 days supply, comparing that to August of 2015.
Our cars were at 161,000, trucks were at 263,000, SUVs were at 134,000, which last month or I’m sorry the month of August gave us 558,000 vehicles translating into 62 days supply, comparing that to September 2015 to September 2014. In September of 2014 we had 154,000 cars, 297,000 trucks, 145,000 SUVs giving us a grand total of 596,000 vehicles in September of last year.
That translated into a day supply of 83 so now that we have the housekeeping items out of the way Jasmine, we’re going to turn things over to open things up for some calls and we’ll lead up with the analyst community please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Liz Suzuki
Good morning this is Liz Suzuki on for John. What percentage of F-Series sales was to fleet customers and are fleet orders starting to be fulfilled now that supply is improving? Because it seems like retail was still the big driver of the year-over-year increase?
Mark LaNeve
I don’t have the exact percentage broken out of the F-Series business in terms of the fleet retail mix maybe we can get it while I’m answering the question. But I could tell you that overall we’re starting to catch up with commercial business across F-Series and we anticipate that we’ll continue to catch up as we move through the fourth quarter.
So it’s been obviously a challenges we work from limited inventories over the last four, five months, but we’re starting to certainly catch up in 17% was fleet of that series got the number while I was talking of the total business.
Liz Suzuki
Great. How does that 17% compared to historical averages?
Mark LaNeve
It will be a little bit light, but not much I think it’s normally about 80, 20 split so be somewhat light, but in line with what we typically do so we’re starting to catch up a little bit.
Liz Suzuki
Thanks. That’s very helpful. Do you have any estimate on how much the Labor Day weakened contributed to the year-over-year increase?
Mark LaNeve
Just the fact that it was in September and it wasn’t in September year ago you’re going to see quite pretty decent increase we’re calling the industry up 12 or 13. But I can tell you that we had a strong Labor Day period. We had a sales event that ended the day after Labor Day, but we stayed strong for the balance of the month. So there was a real whole lot of fluctuation in our case of performance to objective throughout the entire month, it was good from beginning to end one of those really special strong months.
Liz Suzuki
Great, thanks. And just one more quick one, what percentage of your retail sales are leases year-to-date and has that percentage been changing over the last couple of years?
Mark LaNeve
Across the whole portfolio?
Liz Suzuki
Yes.
Mark LaNeve
I’m sorry, could you ask the question again?
Liz Suzuki
Sure. My question is, is what percentage of your retail sales are leases?
Mark LaNeve
We lease roughly at about 20%, 21%, which is in the lower range for the industry, not exceedingly so among the volume players, but we typically run in the 20%, 21%, I think, it’s – we’re right in that number for the year. And it’s pretty much, we’ve been in that range for the last several years.
Liz Suzuki
Great. Thanks very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Liz. Jasmine, next caller, please.
Operator
At this time we don’t have any further questions in queue, sir. We don’t mind I can repeat those instructions. Now we have Liz joining us now. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
David Tamberrino
Yes. Hi, thanks. It’s actually Dave Tamberrino on for Pat. Just a quick question on F-Series inventory, I don’t know if you noted it in your prepared remarks, I didn’t catch it if you did. Where are you right now in terms of inventory? I know, I think the last couple of months you’ve been working to build yourself up into the upper 100,000 level. Just trying to understand where you are in the lower 100,000 level, I should say.
Mark LaNeve
We can pull the exact number for you while I’m answering the question, Dave. I can tell you just a couple of comments is that, we’ve had really strong product flow, as both plants, as we indicated came up in running the full production a couple of months ago. So we were able to keep the dealers stocked even though we had really strong sales performance both August and September actually July as well. We improved our inventory position over the course of the month, but the dealers did turn, the new truck has a high customer demand at historically very high rates during the month. So we ended – we’ve got a 100,000 F-150s that we ended the month, as gross inventory right about that number, and I think that’s an improvement of 7,000 or 8,000 over the course of the month. So I think, we started the month about 91,000, 92,000 ended at 100,000 despite selling 70,000. So it was a very good month from both a replenishment sales performance and replenishment of that inventory.
David Tamberrino
Okay, that’s helpful. Is that the typical ranges you want it in, or I think maybe there was a target of 120,000 that you might have put out there earlier in the year that you wanted to get to if I’m remembering correctly?
Mark LaNeve
I wouldn’t characterize 120,000 as a target. I said there was more of a normative kind of ambient level if you look back over time. I’ll take a month like September anytime where we can sell 70,000 and turn them that quickly, but typically we would roll up to around 120,000, that’s more of a normative planning level. But I wouldn’t characterize it as a target. We target more production in sales performance.
David Tamberrino
Understood. And on the Super Duty side how are inventory levels there and should we be looking for a build of that heading into next year and the changeover?
Mark LaNeve
Super Duty is about 53,000, runs a little bit higher days supply right now than we’re running on F-150, but we’re in a very good comfortable range. And the F – the Super Duty changeover is much more like a normal changeover that we would experience, and we won’t have the extended downtime that we had on F-150. So we would be able to enjoy a much more normal short turnover, as we switch to the all new Super Duty next year, which should be a fantastic product for us.
David Tamberrino
Great. Thanks for the time and congrats on the sales month.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, Dave.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Dave. Jasmine, next caller, please.
Operator
Yes. Our next caller is John Sykes with Nomura. Please proceed.
John Sykes
Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of questions. One is in terms of inventory for the end of this year, what are you kind of thinking? Are you going to be at 62, 67, where do you see – where do you kind of see things shaking out, I guess?
Mark LaNeve
Well, John, I mean, we’ve been running in a roughly a 60-day to 70-day range across the entire portfolio. For some time, we do have implicit in our plans that we build the customer demand, which is very strong right now, but we’re not targeting a certain level of inventory by year end. As I indicated so we’re very comfortable we’re now in that part of the plan.
And we anticipate continue to run that play as we go through the balance of the year. So we’re not targeting a specific level of inventory.
John Sykes
Okay. Let me just try one more, you gave us 2015 where you think the SAAR will come out. Any thoughts on 2016, and what you guys are sort of thinking about internally when you do your budgeting and that type of thing?
Erich Merkle
No, we in terms of 2016, we will give a guidance much later than that John, so we have guidance, but it’s going to come later.
John Sykes
Okay, but is it suffice to say that the fundamentals are sustainable long-term, because obviously September was a great month. It just seems like things in the industry are going really well. Do you guys see anything negative that might change your thinking?
Erich Merkle
We, don’t see anything negative right now I’m speaking to the calendar year to-date and what we’re experiencing right now, which in my horizons the month have just ended in October. And as I’ve indicated on this call and when I speak to our dealer body and the team, the things that we need to be low for the industry to be strong, interest rates, fuel prices, are low.
And the things we need to be high consumer confidence, age of the car park, housing starts are high. So we’re in a very good vibrant economic backdrop for vehicle sales. And obviously the industry and Ford Motor Company particularly are enjoying that. But we’ll continue to assess as we look to what guidance we’ll provide at some future point on the overall industry.
John Sykes
Okay.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, John.
John Sykes
Yes, thank you I appreciate it.
Erich Merkle
You, bet Jasmine, we’re going take one more call from the analyst maybe then we’re going to turn over to the folks in the media.
Operator
All right, it seems at this time Mr. Merkle, we have no remaining analyst in queue at this time.
Erich Merkle
Okay, very good. Well, let’s check it out with the media then.
Operator
Right and media we do welcome questions at this time [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Keith Naughton, with Bloomberg. Please proceed.
Keith Naughton
Hi Mark and Erich, I was just wondering if you have any contingency plans if there is a strike in Kansas City and you lose that F150 production?
Mark LaNeve
In terms of the news around Kansas City I mean we work really hard every day to avoid any kind of disruption at our plants and our production schedule. We’re confident we’re going to be able to negotiate a fair and competitive labor agreement with our UAW partners that’s the way we’ve been operating. And we’re going to continue to work in that direction.
Keith Naughton
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Keith. Jasmine next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Bennett with Wall Street Journal. Pease proceed.
Jeff Bennett
Thanks very much I was just wondering I know you had talked a little bit about this in the earlier call. But could you separate out if do you think the month was pushed mostly by the September Labor Day sales for the industry overall, or were you seeing that there’s enough strength even if there’s Labor Day sales weren’t involved in the picture?
Mark LaNeve
I mean obviously somebody could do the mathematical equation on just Labor Day being in if you look at historic lift for Labor Day there’s some level of it that’s been included in September this year not last year helped. But in our case we were strong from beginning to the end and beyond the Labor Day just the pure calendarization and Labor Day effect we had very, very strong performance. And the numbers I see from the industry indicated that we all benefited. But we seem to have for the strength in the month we seem to have performed very well relative to the industry. And so I think it was both, I think it was a stronger industry than maybe we anticipated. And the Labor Day effect was obviously part of just the pure calendarization of that.
Jeff Bennett
And what the dealers tell you regarding diesel and the fall off from VW did you get any feedback from them of consumer slowing their purchases or maybe walking away from diesel and going somewhere else?
Mark LaNeve
It’s funny as we just recently completed in the last, well, I mean, the news broke mid-September. But we’ve – I’ve been with a bunch of dealers since the news broke. And in terms of Ford dealers, it’s been zero commentary. And so it certainly hasn’t gotten into their radar screen, so it’s been a non-factor in terms of our dealer body that, the VW diesel issue.
Jeff Bennett
Okay. And last one, Erich, are you looking at probably SAAR coming in then above the 17.3, I know you said higher end, but can you narrow it a little further, or do you think it will come in between like 17.4 and 17.5?
Mark LaNeve
For the month or the year?
Jeff Bennett
I’m sorry, for the year?
Erich Merkle
No, I mean, Yang said earlier, I mean, we have a range for our guidance, which is between 17% and 17.5% that we think is probably going to come be at the higher end of that range.
Jeff Bennett
Okay. Okay, thanks, guys.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, John.
Erich Merkle
Yes. Thanks, John. Jasmine, the next call, please.
Operator
Yes. Our next caller is Nick Bunkley with Automotive News. Please proceed.
Nick Bunkley
Hi, good morning. Looking at the Focus and the Fusion, both of those are down on the year just with those segments doing what they have across the industry. We had the Focus down quite a bit and the Fusion up quite a bit this month. Can you talk about what’s happened, why those two performed differently this month?
Mark LaNeve
Well, we continue to have a lot of pressure in – across the car category obviously – more obviously. And I think once we pull-through all the numbers, we anticipate more pressure was on the C-Car segment than CD this month. We had an unbelievable Fusion month, driven largely by performance on the West Coast. California, the Fusion did unbelievably well with a great focus by our dealer body out there at a grassroots tactical level.
So we’re delighted with the Fusion performance this month. And we’ll have to see how it shakes out over the course of the next couple of years. We’ve seen customers moving from the passenger car category into SUVs and to trucks. Overall, that’s a very good trend for Ford Motor Company. But we obviously are very proud of our car lineup and are going to be breaking an all new ad campaign, I think today and tomorrow that we think is going to drive a lot of attention to our great lineup, so we’re going to continue to put a lot of focus on it. And we were delighted with Fusion performance this month and continue to pay a lot of attention to focus as well.
Nick Bunkley
Okay. Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Thank you. Next, Jasmine, we’re going to take one more caller from the media community and then we’re going to wrap things up.
Operator
Mr. Merkle, at this time, we have no further questions registered at the moment.
Erich Merkle
Okay, very good. Well, we’ll call that a wrap for the month and everyone take care. Have a great month of October and we’ll see you again first thing in November to talk about October sales. Thank you, everyone.
Mark LaNeve
Thank you, everyone.
