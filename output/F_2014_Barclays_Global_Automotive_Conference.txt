Good morning. You can start 20 minutes live and you will go sit down there, I join you to kind of do more informal Q&A.
Brian Johnston
[Starts Abruptly] brand. As you know we actually have -- Edwin Park [ph], European colleagues are here -- a number of premium and luxury makers with us over the next couple days. We’ve got Lincoln, we have Cadillac, we have Tesla, of course Fiat, Chrysler has a few luxury brands in its tables and of course we’ve got Cadillac tomorrow. So I think this is really the first year we’ve had good premium again, we’d encourage you, we’ve got a Lincoln MKC among other vehicles downstairs. So if you’ve seen me to the ad or Saturday Night Live parody of the ad, this is your chance to see the vehicle up close.
Very pleased to have with us Kumar Galhotra. He is, as I mentioned, the head of Lincoln, reports directly into Mark Fields and is charged with doubling the global – the Lincoln brand globally. He came to that position from Vice President of Engineering where he is engineering all trucks, SUVs, cross-over vehicles, had spent time in product development in Asia Pacific and Africa and in other assignments that are interesting, the Ford Ranger in the South American market, chief engineer on the Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute and vehicle programs director for five years. So lot of expertise in the automotive.
Kumar will talk about 20 minutes and then we will have a fireside chat.
Kumar Galhotra
Thank you, Brian. Good morning. First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to come share the Lincoln journey with you guys. And we’ve all been involved in and have witnessed rejuvenation of different brands. This one is really special. It’s special because we're reinvigorating an iconic automotive luxury brand and it's really special to me personally because I get to serve on the team that's actually going to do it.
But before I get into Lincoln, I'm going to take just a few minutes to share where we are as a corporation, where’s total Ford Motor Company.
So what you see on the slide here is our One Ford plan. There are four elements to it. It has a very compelling vision, has a comprehensive strategy and is based on relentless implementation. And we’re continuing to focus on all four of these elements. They’ve served us very very well so far and we’re going to continue to build on those.
The plan, like any plan, is dynamic. This is basically how we run the business. It has become very much a part of our culture. So we’re embracing the learnings from this plan. We’re constantly improving quality, launch, scale, footprint, our consumer experiences and building a stronger company.
So where are we now? We are substantially stronger company than we were just a few years ago. From about 2006 to 2013, we fixed the fundamentals of our business. We grew and significantly strengthened Ford Motor. We’ve rationalizedd our vehicle platforms and we’ve deployed our One Ford portfolio across the globe. We’ve launched advanced technologies like the SYNC and the EcoBoost engine and we’ve electrified a lot of our platforms.
We had a very strong business in North America. We've sustained and strengthened that business and we’ve grown in China and we’ve grown profitably in China. And we've got a transformation plan underway for Europe. So in doing all this, our balance sheet has strengthened quite substantially and we’ve achieved investment grade credit rating.
So how do we measure that success? We’ve got five key measurable. We want to be top five in sales globally. We want to continuously balance our profitability amongst regions and segments. We're shooting for operating margins of 8% to 9%. We want to be top quartile amongst our peer group for total shareholder return. And these are the five key strategies that underpin those measurables that I just talked about.
Let’s start with strong brands. We have a very strong brand in Ford. We’re going to continue to strengthen it and we’re going to grow Lincoln. And that's what I am going to talk about in a few minutes.
We are going to serve in all markets. We’re going to continue to nurture the mature markets and we’re going to continue to expand in emerging markets. And we’re going to do that by providing a complete family of best-in-class small, medium and large vehicles. And we’re going to think like a mobility company. We’re going to provide consumer experiences that are leading-edge in connectivity and autonomous vehicle technologies.
And finally what you see on the last box, those are the results. A strong business that delivers scaled benefits, optimized footprint, cost efficiencies and improved processes.
So if you think about these five, the three on the left are basically related to growth; the fourth one is about innovation and the fifth one is operational excellence.
And here are the results. The total company guidance for 2014 and 2015 is unchanged from what we provided at our third quarter earnings announcement. In 2014 right now, we have about 23 launches going on globally. So there's a lot of investment in all of those launches and all those new products. The benefits from all these launches and investments are coming forward in 2015 and beyond. So we will have a stronger product lineup, higher volumes, revenues and margins and profits.
So as a reminder, all forward-looking statements are subject to risk factors summarized in the presentation materials in the back and these are also part of our 10-K filing.
So that’s where we are with Ford.
Now let’s talk about Lincoln. What you see on the – so I want to provide a little bit of context of overall industry and the luxury industry and where the Lincoln is placed in there.
So what you see on the X-axis are the size of the segment in the industry. So for example, small cars are 53% of the global industry, and Ford has a 6.7% share of that segment. So go to the far right, luxury right now is about 9% of the industry and Lincoln has a 1.2% share. So lots of opportunity for us to grow.
So let’s look at that 9% of the industry. What you see on the left is how it's growing. It was 8% in 2000, 9% in 2013, expected to be 10% in 2020. But what's more important on that part of the slide is the absolute numbers. It’s 7.5 million in 2013 grows to about 10.7 million units by 2020. So substantial growth in absolute numbers of luxury units.
What you see on the right is even more important. Although it is 8% to 10% by volume, it is over 30% of the profit pool. So tremendous profit opportunity and great margins in the luxury segment. So that's the opportunity for Lincoln.
Today about 69,000 or 70,000 Ford customers trade-in their vehicle and buy a luxury vehicle. Today we’re serving less than one in four of those customers. So there's a lot of opportunity as our Ford customers come back to provide them Lincoln vehicles that they can move into.
China is growing quite rapidly. US and China are going to be about 50% of that 10 million industry just in the few years. Those are going to be the two biggest luxury markets in the world. China is actually going to pass I think US within the next few months or next year.
So we started researching China about three years ago. I was living there. I was leading the product development organization for Asia-Pacific. And the more we researched the more we found how well regarded the Lincoln brand is in China. The favorable opinion even though we weren’t selling Lincolns there at the time - the favorable opinion for Lincoln in China is equal to that of Lexus. And the perception of Prestige is actually ahead of Audi. So a tremendous opportunity for us to launch in China which is going to be one of the biggest markets in the world.
So how are we going to do that? Very clear strategies, three of them. A very clear brand definition, unique and compelling products that deliver on that brand definition and very distinctive client experiences and a dealer network that also delivers on that brand definition.
And that brand has three key pillars: quality, design and personal service. Quality for luxury customers is more than just reducing things gone wrong. It's about creating things gone right. It's about creating surprises and delights. It's about materials; it's about the richness of our interiors. It is about craftsmanship. We are very focused on delivering all of those attributes in our vehicles.
Let’s talk about design. The exterior styling and interior styling continue to be top purchase reasons for luxury vehicles. So we started this rejuvenation journey with MKC – MKZ, I am sorry, the sedan and that vehicle is doing very very well and I will now share the details of the performance of that vehicle in a minute. But that vehicle was the first vehicle in this rejuvenation journey that had the new Lincoln design language.
The second vehicle in that journey is the MKC, the one that’s parked downstairs. That is the SUV interpretation of that design language. A midsize SUV is coming next year, the MKX, also continuing to build on the same design language which is resonating very well with the customers.
So the Z and C well underway, more beautiful products are coming. The third brand pillar is personalized service. This is very important to luxury customers both in the US and in China and I'll share with you in a minute how we’re approaching the personalized service for our consumers.
So the growth plan is based on clearly distinguished luxury brand, a dedicated product development, design, marketing and sales team. We’re expanding our product lineup and I'll talk to that just in a second. And we’re entering and growing in China.
So here is the product line. We had promised four all new vehicles by 2016, the MKZ I mentioned, already launched, doing very well. MKC, already launched, also doing very well. The all-new MKX coming next year and then a sedan comes in 2016 and that sedan is designed to compete with the long wheelbase these segment vehicles had to have.
And what you see at the bottom of the screen are two new entries that will be coming towards the end of the decade. Let’s take a look at these products. What you see on the top left is the first product in the rejuvenation journey, that’s the MKZ I talked about.
What you see on top right is the MKC, the small utility. The bottom left is the midsize utility that's coming next year and what you see on the right isn’t part of those four product I talked about by 2016 because this is a freshening but it is a fantastic freshening of the Navigator. We just freshened this vehicle, put an all new interior in it, all new EcoBoost engine in it, a great suspension and the response from customers, media, dealers has just been phenomenal. We just started shipping it a few weeks ago and in October that vehicle grabbed more than 25% of its segment, so doing very, very well.
So if you combine those successful products, what does it look like in terms of growth? Well the luxury industry in the United States grew 8% this year so far compared to 2013. Lincoln grew 15%. So the new design language, the new products really resonating with the customers. It’s not just in volume, this is – these are the metrics for the Lincoln MKZ, the first product in the journey. It is bringing in substantially higher revenue. So the transaction price for the model it replaced was 29,000 per unit. The 2014 model year is bringing in more than 38,000 per unit, an increase of over $9000 per vehicle.
It is also ranked number one in J.D. Power APEAL study for exterior styling. So the design language is working. It is also ranked number one for technology, comfort and storage, all attributes that are extremely important to these customers.
The year-to-date sales are up, the share is up, it’s bringing in a younger customer into the showroom. We sell a gas version and a hybrid version. This mix of the hybrid version has gone up substantially to 32% and our conquest rate -- this is very key for a brand that’s on a rejuvenation journey -- our conquest rate in this vehicle is 55%. 55% of the vehicles -- buying this vehicle have not purchased a Lincoln before.
And let’s look at the second vehicle in the journey, the MKC. We launched it in May, started building the inventories for a diverse [ph] so that the customers could have the right choices. By July when we reached appropriate levels of inventory the vehicle was grabbing 7% of its segment -- over 7%.
In September, when we launched the ad campaign with Matthew McConaughey, it grabbed nearly 9% of the share. That campaign by the way is doing absolutely fantastic with -- for the brand, for the MKC as a vehicle and it's basically brought Lincoln into the conversation. I mean there's so many spoofs done in all of them positive, it’s absolutely fantastic how well that campaign is going.
In October, we almost got 10%, 9.7% share of segment. So this vehicle is doing absolutely fantastic in the marketplace. Both of these vehicles, the MKZ and MKC, is what we're launching with in China. We introduced the brand in China in April, where as I said we’re launching with MKZ and MKC, we opened the three dealerships two weeks ago. It’s one of the fun parts of my job, I get to go over there and look at these facilities, be part of the design of the facilities and I will show you how fantastic these facilities are.
And as we were researching luxury consumer habits in China, what we discovered was they are looking for some very distinctive client experiences. The experience they are looking for in China in a dealership is actually different than the consumers of -- the kind of experiences consumers looking for in the US or in Europe.
So we’ve crafted a very unique way of serving these customers, in Chinese it's called Lincoln Judo [ph], it roughly translates into the Lincoln way and I brought a very short video to share with you what that means. So let's take a look at it.
[Video Presentation]
So the facility you saw in that video was actually a prototype facility we built in Shanghai. We used it to test all kinds of things about the dealership, about traffic, how people felt comfortable or uncomfortable, how to serve their needs, to train the staff and the real dealerships is what you see here.
So on top left, what you see is the opening ceremony of the store in Beijing two weeks ago and those three stores –those are the outside shots of the Beijing store, the Shanghai store and the Hangzhou store.
What you see here is what the dealerships look like on the inside, which we research a lot of luxury brands automotive and nonautomotive in China on how they treat their customers and what the customer expectations are. We research hotels, we research fashion houses and some of the key items started becoming very clear. There’s just a common thread running go through those experiences and it's about relationships and hospitality. Those customers don't see a dealership or any of those showrooms as a place just to make a transaction. It is the place to be comfortable, it is the place to build a relationship with the salesperson. It is a place to sort of look through what's available, what's not available. So let me share some of those elements there.
Tea obviously is a very very important part of hospitality in China. And as we were researching all these luxury brands, any customer that walks in, tea is just a part of how you greet them. And it is not tea out of a paper cup or out of a teabag, it's crafted and very – served in a very specific way. So we have a very sophisticated tea bar in every one of our dealerships which is actually part of the experience.
What you see on the top right -- top left, I am sorry – is a lane of vehicles. So every dealership will have either two or three of these lanes and they are appropriately placed where the customers can interact with the vehicle in a very low pressure or no pressure environment.
What you see on top right is where they interact with the staff. It is a very warm inviting living room kind of a situation and environment. What you see on the bottom right is the technology. So between those lines of cars as you can see, as I said, every dealership will have either two or three but between those lanes are the studios with a very large screen so you can see a vehicle practically in reel five. What you in front of it it's not very clear because it’s a horizontal kind of a table, is an electronic console where the customers can build and price the vehicle. So they can see the vehicle in different colors, you can put different wheels on it. You can see different interiors and explore what the vehicle has to offer.
So we’ve launched three stores. We will be launching five more in the next six or seven weeks. So by the end of the year we will have 8 stores. Next year we will launch another 20 plus stores and continue to grow the brand in China.
So growing in the US, as I said we’re up 15% this year. We’re entering China. We will triple our volume from 2013 to 2014. We will go from 100,000 units to 300,000 units. And as you can see most of the growth will come from US and from entering China. We also saw in other markets in Mexico, Canada, Middle East and all of those markets will contribute to the growth as well. And longer term beyond 2020 we see potential for more than 300,000 units.
And we’re going to fund this plan appropriately. We will be investing over $2.5 billion of capital over the next five years to deliver on the plan that I just discussed. On the right you see margins. Most successful luxury brands deliver double-digit operating margins. We have a plan to invest properly, to resource it properly, so we can participate in those margins.
So in summary, lots of opportunity for growth in the US and in China. The journey has already begun in US and the first two vehicles are doing absolutely, were up 15%. In China, we’re poised for success. We’re launching our stores, we’re launching the brand and we’re crafting very unique distinctive experiences for our customers both in US and in China. So the future for Lincoln looks great and I'm really thrilled to be part of it.
With that, thank you for listening and I’d love to take a few questions now.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Brian Johnston
Again we’re going to go to the audience response questions. So why don’t we pull up. We’re going to do a few [indiscernible]. Just very quickly, we can start clock – you’re currently on the stock – stock being Ford, Lincoln is not yet publicly traded and some day perhaps we'll talk about a Lincoln spin-out maybe. 74% do not own it, those are your prospects. 11% overweight, 11% -- let's quickly move to 16, general buy, [indiscernible] clock, will be doing this for all our publicly traded companies I believe. So we get a baseline coming out of this, shall we say, almost, your net promoter score. So even if they are not owned, would that promote you, do they feel positive like. High number of neutrals kind of split 29% positive, 14% negative, so slight positive bias there and then finally 17 and we’ll go to talk about Lincoln.
Start the clock, sell-side consensus we happen to be at 161 ourselves, about right 55%, so fairly we show that about right in the middle, it’s pretty much a bell curve around that. Okay. So let’s turn now that we kind of know where people’s heads are at around Ford. Just kind of to some of the dynamics of the luxury or premium market. Your share – let’s bring up number 20. Yeah, your share in luxury market was 6.9% in 2010, now you don’t make the town car anymore, 4.6% now, you can start the clock, where do people think luxury as defined by wards your share is going to wind up compared to the 4.6% it's year-to-date.
So 6% to 7%, so 52% think you'll go higher, get that 6% to 7%, 13% not. So maybe just talk, who is really your competition and where do you hope to get your conquest from – is it the traditional German luxury players, is it another premium players, the Lexus, Infinitis of the world or where do you in particular see your Ford family kind of migrating out to?
Kumar Galhotra
So as I mentioned there's two or three things. So first of all, there is a large pool of our own Ford customers that are moving up from Ford to luxury and we want to capture as many of those in our family as possible and that metric is looking good.
Secondly, the growth in China, most of the luxury car customers in China are new to luxury and they are right now trying to make up their mind on should I go buy an Audi or a Lexus or BMW or hopefully a Lincoln very soon. What we’re looking at is positioning our brand as I mentioned earlier based on really clear design language and a very clear customer experience. We see a wide space there right now especially in China where none of the existing makers are paying the kind of attention to personal -- personalized service and luxury as we are. And in the US a lot of it again comes back to the styling of the vehicle and the technology and the attributes that we offer. And each one of the brands has their own design language. Cadillac has a very specific design language so is Audi. We have an all new design language that is on the first two vehicles and is unique and is really resonating with that particular luxury customer and we’re going to continue to build on that and that's where most of the growth comes from.
Brian Johnston
So as you look at the initial buyers of MKX and MKC, what are the types of vehicles they are trading in and what types of vehicles were they cross shopping?
Kumar Galhotra
So they're coming from – actually especially C has been a very interesting experience. It is bringing in a lot more affluent and a lot younger customer than the brand in general. Same thing happened when we launched the Z, also a younger customer, more affluent customer, higher revenue. And the cross-shop is very very varied, it includes Cadillac, includes Audi, includes BMW, MKC for example gets cross-shopped against the X3. So it's actually quite varied both from -- moving up from non-luxury brands to luxury and cross-shopping with luxury as well.
Brian Johnston
Okay. Let’s pull up number 21. And start the clock, it’s pretty quick question. I mean how important given people's attitudes overall to Lincoln and we get some more questions -- do people think that Lincoln is to the Ford investment thesis? First of all it seems to be one of the major corporate priorities.
Kumar Galhotra
It is because the profit pool is so substantial and secondly the growth in China is so substantial.
Brian Johnston
So interesting, 48% said somewhat important, 22% said somewhat unimportant. So majority think it is important to the story. I’d say this number is certainly higher than I expected.
And which sort of gets to – let’s move on to China. You mentioned your reason [indiscernible] is the customer experience, so that’s been under invested, and certainly I would think the Ritz-Carlton hotels when I saw your dealership models – even more modern looking. More modern – the Asian or the Mandarin Oriental, sort of the Asian – the Asian brands. I mean what evidence do you have -- that's going to be enough to kind of or let me put it another way – how do you deal with once you get out of the showroom the Prestige factor of driving your vehicle versus the more established German brands, because it’s certainly great to have a nice customer experience but unlike hotels which you consume and move on and maybe people are aware with where you stay briefly, the car is with you for 3 to 4 years and it’s a constant statement like a purchase or a tie-up.
Kumar Galhotra
Well, it’s based on both the product and the experience and we are starting with a very strong favorable opinion already for the Lincoln.
Brian Johnston
And where does that come from? I mean we know De Luxe were driven by the Comintern or by the nationalist government, was Lincoln as part of that era?
Kumar Galhotra
No.
Brian Johnston
They were looked upon fondly?
Kumar Galhotra
No, it’s the era – lot of customers, even very young customers brought out was – they see it as the car of President, so, so much so that we're calling the top line the Presidential. It's very much connected to car –
Brian Johnston
So it’s the image and the heritage in the US as the presidential limousine.
Kumar Galhotra
Yes, it’s the presidential limousine and it is seen as a vehicle of celebrities. So a lot of customers mentioned Marilyn Monroe's vehicle, they mentioned the Rat Pack Frank Sinatra and all those guys driving around in 1960s Lincoln. So the heritage is very much part of the brand.
Brian Johnston
So nothing to do with its history or lack thereof in China. Got an image of American luxury from a different era?
Kumar Galhotra
Absolutely. And so we’re starting with that very base, where it’s already seen as prestigious and we’re launching with two great products that are doing very well here and in other markets. And we’re launching it with a consumer experience that by the way goes beyond just the purchase experience. So the vehicles are becoming very connected, lot of software in there, how we work with those consumers throughout the life of the ownership experience. And I will just give you a quick example. Personalized service is so important. We have a license plate recognition system installed at the entrance of every dealership. So as soon as any Lincoln order drives in, the entire staff is immediately notified that Mr. Zu or Mr. Lee has just entered the dealership and they know what he’s got, what he is coming in for, they can greet him and work with him. Lot of transparency in everything, so the entire process is personalized.
Brian Johnston
And let’s bring up number 24 sort of get the – do you own your dealers while that’s been coming up in China, or do you own your those three sales outlets – do you have a dealer partner you're working with and –
Kumar Galhotra
We have several dealer partners and that's been another really good sign where once we started this process, the interest from dealers and investing and getting the franchise was enormous. So we have picked – we have had the opportunity to pick the best dealers possible with a lot of experience in luxury brands and that's where we’re building.
Brian Johnston
So your first three, they are independent dealers –
Kumar Galhotra
They are independent dealers, yes.
Brian Johnston
Do they own other luxury brand outlets?
Kumar Galhotra
They do own other luxury brands, yes.
Brian Johnston
And what attracted them to Lincoln, what did they say?
Kumar Galhotra
It's the same thing. We shared our story and our plan and our vehicles with them and our concept of the brand and how we’re going to position it. And they had a lot of faith in their plan and a lot of them were -- are wanting to be part of the story.
Brian Johnston
Well let’s start at the clock. Here we are asking about the Lincoln launch in China. Will it challenge and take share from other premium brands in the region? Ah, scored quickly. Yes, so 44% somewhat agree and then 21 – you’ve certainly got some current converts here. Looks great.
What happens when you give this presentation in Europe or have you yet?
Kumar Galhotra
We have not. We do not have plans to go to Europe yet.
Brian Johnston
Right, or to your European investors.
Kumar Galhotra
To European investors, I have not –
Brian Johnston
I will leave that to George in Geneva in February. So and that’s right – I think one thing you actually are saying is you’re taking the US and China, you're not necessarily trying to unlike say Tesla, make big inroads in the German market or convince the French to give up the French?
Kumar Galhotra
We’re at the early stages of our journey. We’re very focused on US, has a huge opportunity in China and we’re going to stay focused on those markets.
Brian Johnston
Questions from the floor.
Unidentified Analyst
I guess coming back to your dealerships in China, a lot of your German competitors are talking about the needs of the dealership to be more sustainable and is that pushing into tier 2, tier 3 cities not being as lavish as the flagship dealership, are you expecting to see that similar move as you expand on your dealership size?
Kumar Galhotra
I am sorry, I didn’t quite understand –
Unidentified Analyst
So the Germans are talking about dealership being too lavish, too many gyms and spas and the dealerships and it’s not a sustainable model for the dealers.
Kumar Galhotra
I wouldn't call ours lavish. Ours are – we do not have gyms. Ours are inviting comfortable relationship building spaces and they were not super-expensive in the sense where we went overboard they’re designed just right for what kind of experience we wanted to craft. So we don’t see that issue. And the environment inside the dealership actually when it's come to life, it's one thing to design it and then another -- so it sometimes can fail as you launch the real building. So we, like I showed you on the video, we built a what would essentially be a lab dealership for two years and tested it for all kinds of stuff. So we don't see that concern.
Brian Johnston
Couple of other –
Unidentified Analyst
My understanding is that you're not localizing production today in China for Lincoln. So how do you compete with other luxury OEMs that are planning to expand production I guess in country with the tariff and taxes that you have to save?
Kumar Galhotra
Sure. Well the key – so as you know our business is very capital intensive and there is an appropriate time to start localizing when you have enough scale. So we’re just launching, we will be very carefully monitoring how we progress and when there is time we certainly consider localization but at the moment we do not have plans to localize.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, what’s your finance strategy in China?
Kumar Galhotra
It's very similar to here. So we have a Lincoln Financial just like we have Ford Credit here. That’s serving both consumers and our dealers.
Unidentified Analyst
Do you expect that program to grow in line with units?
Kumar Galhotra
Absolutely. We expect the program – yes.
Brian Johnston
Do we have another question over there? While we are waiting let’s pull up number 23. On the eras, Lincoln will achieve its goals of tripling global volumes – so level of agreement, so we already have a positive sentiment towards China.
Just maybe kind of where volume goes because Lincoln in the past was kind of muddy, you have Explorer -- the Expedition – the Navigator, now Expedition, you had the Town Car, you had some sedans, so was that – was it a volume more of a goal now, are you kind of scaling back and say, okay, our first goal is brand equity and then get the volume up?
Kumar Galhotra
It’s both in parallel. So we’re building the brand equity but you can build that only with credible products and that credible product journey started with the sedan, as I said, it’s done very well. The MKC, the small utility which is one of the fastest growing segments in the industry both here and even growing faster in China is the small premium utility SPU. I really encourage you guys to go take a look at that vehicle that’s downstairs. It’s really beautiful outside and inside packed with technology. So picking the segments where the luxury markets are moving and presenting credible Lincoln products and there is – it’s how we’re going to grow.
Brian Johnston
Well, thank you very much.
Kumar Galhotra
Thank you.
