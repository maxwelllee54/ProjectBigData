'Walking Dead' Unveils New Poster and Teases Super Bowl Ad

The Walking Dead returns Feb. 18 after a mid-season hiatus. Fans got a taste of what's to come today when AMC teased the back half of season three with a new poster.
Emblazoned with the phrase "AN EYE FOR AN EYE," the poster hints at the impending battle between The Governor (and his minions) and Rick Grimes (and his fellow survivors).
