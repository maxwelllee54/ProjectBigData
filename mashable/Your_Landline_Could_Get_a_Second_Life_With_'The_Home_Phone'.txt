Your Landline Could Get a Second Life With 'The Home Phone'

Dust off that landline â€” household phones may be making a comeback with a new Kickstarter project. 
The Home Phone, designed by French husband and wife team UrbanHello, is a smartphone for the whole family, allowing shared conversations with its automatic hands-free mode. When placed on a surface, the 360-degree loudspeaker activates, and its use reduces electromagnetic wave exposure by 99%. 
You may not trade your iPhone in just yet, but the Home Phone's sleek, modern design and HD sound is a minimalist alternative to bulky, cordless home devices on the market. 
"It's a device which is so beautiful it can be given to someone as a present just like a bouquet of flowers," Herve and Catherine Artus say on their Kickstarter page. 
With a keypad hidden at the bottom and two discreet OLED displays at either end, it doesn't even look like a phone. Check out the video, above, for more. 
UrbanHello's Kickstarter campaign launched Jan. 6 after winning the "Innovations Award" at CES 2013 in Las Vegas.  After two days, the project has reached $23,152 of its $160,390 goal. 
Backers have until Feb. 14 to fund the project and get their own Home Phone at a discounted price. Without the discount, it'll cost an estimated $169 when the product launches. 
Don't remember how to use a landline? Like most house phones, the Home Phone charges on its base, and can be plugged into an existing phone line with its connector. The "new generation of home phones" also stores up to 20 contacts and displays caller ID on both screens. 
Do you think this reinvention can save household phones? Let us know what you think in the comments.
