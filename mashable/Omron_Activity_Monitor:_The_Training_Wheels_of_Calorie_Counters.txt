Omron Activity Monitor: The Training Wheels of Calorie Counters

LAS VEGAS â€” While there is no shortage of fitness devices on display here at the 2013 International CES, there is at least a new way to measure all the running, walking and calorie counting you do.
Omron's Activity Monitor tracks your activity and exercise data, and reveals your total calories burned throughout the day. It was shown Monday in a news conference at CES along with other new devices from Omron.
Randy Kellogg, vice president of marketing and product development at Omron HealthCare told Mashable these are designed to not be too complicated. He likens it to a set of training wheels. While people may eventually graduate to a Nike FuelBand or FitBit device, they can sometimes be too complicated for people who just want to get started. 
"Everybody can walk 2,000 steps and track their activity," he said.  
Consumers are looking for simple and social, according to Omron. Kellogg says women like to walk together, they like to share information so they added a social component through Ormonfitness.com.
The goal tracker helps you set targets and the monitor will let you know how much of what type of activity you need to do to reach those goals.
One feature we're not entirely sold on is an NFC communication tray (sold separately) that connects the tracker to your computer. It works with Mac and PC and wirelessly transfers the data so you can monitor your progress on omronfitness.com. We would much prefer to see a Bluetooth option which Kellogg says is an open option for the next version.
The Activity Monitor will cost $49.99 when it launches and the NFC tray will sell for $20.
Omron also introduced a Strapless Heart Rate Monitor, for those who don't like the feel of a chest strap when they work out. All your data, including target heart rate appears on a device you wear on your wrist. That will cost $149.99 and is expected to be out in the next month. 
There's also a Tri-Axis USB Pedometer which will be available for around $45.
In the end, Kellogg says, it doesn't matter what kind of device you choose, as long as you get up and walk. It reduces stress and improves your health. You don't have to run a marathon, but you can find out how close you're getting to one.
