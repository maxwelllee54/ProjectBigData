Good morning ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the UAW-Ford 2015 Collective Bargaining Agreement Edification Briefing hosted by Ted Cannis, Executive Director of Investor Relations. My name is Sheila and I am operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to advise all parties this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
And now I'd like to hand over to Mr. Ted Cannis. Please go ahead.
Ted Cannis
All right. Thank you, Sheila and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today. On behalf of the entire Ford management team I would like to thank you for taking this time to be with us, so that we can provide you with additional details of the 2015 UAW-Ford Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Copies of our press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford investor and media websites. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO. Also participating are Robert Shanks , Ford Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Joe Hinrichs, Ford President of the Americas; John Fleming, Ford Executive Vice President, Manufacturing and Labor; and Bill Dirksen, Ford Vice President, Labor Affairs. Mark, over to you.
Mark Fields
Okay, thanks Ted and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd just like to start out by thanking the UAW and also the Ford bargaining teams for their leadership in delivering an agreement with a shared goal of creating a stronger Ford.
And first, I'd just like to start out with a couple of thoughts on why we were successful in ratifying this contract. First, we had open dialogue. Secondly, is we were transparent with each other during the negotiations. Third, we had a stronger bargaining teams, and lastly we had a shared goal.
And both sides negotiated hard, but in the end I think we produced a deal that works for everyone. The outcome was the product essentially what we do best at Ford which is working together as one team.
And importantly this contract also provides a good foundation for us and for our company, our employees and also the communities as we work together to create an even stronger business in the months and years ahead.
If you go on to slide 2 you can see slide 2 outlines the highlights of the agreement. First off, the agreement enables us to continue investing in US plants, creating and retaining US jobs and also providing base pay increases, bonuses and other benefits to our UAW workforce.
In addition we also committed to a $9 billion investment in our US plants and we expect to create or secure 8,500 hourly US jobs. And I'd note that that includes support for the all new Ford Super Duty, the Ford F-150 Raptor, the Lincoln Continental and also several new powertrain technologies that we'll be introducing.
Importantly, this agreement puts us on a common footing with our domestic competitors with regard to the overall structure of our labor costs. As we look at the contract period, our total labor cost increases, net of operating improvements which are enabled under this agreement are in line with our planning assumptions, and the agreement effectively closes our labor cost gap to GM and substantially narrows the gap to FCA.
Our deal costs no more than if we had used the GM pattern and we made other offsets in the agreement that were used to fund the additional $500 in ratification bonus. And overall our US labor costs will increase by less than 1.5% a year, including the ratification bonus. And I'd note that this is less than our present forecast of inflation over the contract period.
The agreement also confirms our US sourcing commitments through the contract period. And finally we expect to book about $600 million of expense in the fourth quarter, and that's primarily related to the ratification bonuses. And this is consistent with our Company full-year guidance for 2015, and the agreement in total is consistent with our long-term objectives.
If you move on to slide 3, you can see that our Ford-UAW members will continue to share in our success in North America which was an important tenet of this contract. We're providing wage increases for the first time since 2005 and also lump sum bonuses to our legacy employees.
We're also transitioning from entry level tier wage structure to an in-progression structure with an eight year grow in model and importantly this eliminates our cap on these workers.
Our defined benefits retirement plans which cover about two thirds of our hourly employees remains unchanged and our contribution to the defined contribution plan will increase from 4% to 6.4% covering employees hired after 2007. And for our UAW retirees, we'll make annual payments of $250 and $125 to surviving spouses beginning in 2016.
And while we've followed the pattern set by FCA and GM to restore the Easter Monday holiday, the gains that we're achieving with additional mandatory overtime capacity are significant for us.
And speaking of that if you go on to slide 4, you can see that the new agreement does provide us with several opportunities to improve our productivity. We're significantly enhancing our ability to use lower cost temporary employees to supplement the workforce, especially to cover such things as unplanned absenteeism for our vacation replacement coverage and for product launches.
And this will also allow us to reduce structural costs and improve our staffing flexibility. The use of alternative work schedules and the ability to implement additional daily and weekend mandatory overtime will increase our production capacity to meet customer demand.
And beyond our US sourcing commitments, we're maintaining our flexibility to leverage our global manufacturing footprint to improve our cost competitiveness for products that we may sell in North America. And then finally, maintaining the current level of supplemental unemployment benefits allows us to remain competitive in the event of an economic downturn.
So summing up on slide 5, I would step back and say we're pleased with the agreement. It supports our near and long-term priorities as a company and provides a good foundation for Ford, our employees and the communities where we work to again to continue to strengthen our business into the future.
So with that as an overview, what I'd like to do is open it up for questions. And as Ted mentioned with me here are Bob Shanks, John Fleming, Joe Hinrichs and Bill Dirksen. So we'd love to take your questions, okay.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, you question-answer session will begin. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
John Murphy
Good morning guys and thanks for holding this call and giving us the details.
Mark Fields
Good morning, John.
John Murphy
Just a first question, as we think about the legacy tier of workers that you have, it seems like the large majority of them are eligible for retirement in the next 5 years, I think it's about 60%, I was just wondering if you can confirm that number?
And as they retire or you see this sort of natural attrition over time, do you see the need to replace them one for one with a new entry level worker or is there the opportunity to potentially get a little bit more efficient with a workforce over time?
Mark Fields
Bill?
Bill Dirksen
Yes, this is Bill Dirksen. We do have some attrition we expect in the next 4 years. It's not going to be a higher amount than it's been in recent years. I think for the next couple of years we'll have some more attrition we forecast coming toward the end of this agreement and into the next agreement.
And as far as replacement it's going to depend on many factors. We're always getting more efficient in our operations. So as we get attrition we take a look at where we're at in terms of our manpower needs, replace it when we need to which would be within progression employees or temporary employees going forward.
And then if we don't need to we can take advantage of it to improve the efficiency of the operations.
Mark Fields
And John, including every day looking at improving the efficiency of our operations part of this agreement was to create or secure 8,500 US hourly jobs. So that's an important part of this in addition as we continue to look for efficiencies in our plants.
John Murphy
Okay. And then just a second question, if we think about flexibility sort of on the upside and the downside with this new contract, you may or may not agree with this, but if we saw another 10% to 15% upside in the North American market would you need to hire workers and would you be able to handle that in your existing capacity base?
And then also subsequently which I think is probably a long way off, we saw a 20% or 30% decline in a typical downturn in the US market. And what is your ability to lay off and separate workers in the next downturn, how does that process work?
Mark Fields
Well let me take the first part and maybe Joe you can take the second part on the downside. On the upside, clearly depending upon whatever number you throw out there, 5%, 10%, et cetera.
I think one of the important agreements that we've made in this labor contract is first the ability and the flexibility to optimize the alternative work schedules, which have worked extremely well for us in the last contract to increase capacity.
Secondly is the ability to utilize temporary workers, particularly in cases of absenteeism or for product launches. So there are a number of different things that we can use. Then finally we were able to agree with our union partners for daily overtime, but also mandatory weekend overtime at our plants. So I think Joe it's about 6 weekends a year?
Joe Hinrichs
6 additional weekends, plus additional half an hour of daily overtime on the weekend crew, for city crew.
Mark Fields
So that will give us more levers to pull to get more capacity without actually having to build brick-and-mortar, which obviously is something we pay attention to. Joe, do you want to take the second?
Joe Hinrichs
Yes, John, good morning. A key component of this for us in the negotiations was maintaining that flexibility for a scenario where we would see a reduction in industry volume, which we all certainly believe will happen at some point in time in the future.
There are really no changes in this agreement from the 2011 agreement from those benefits or those requirements. So essentially they are carried over from 2011 which there was a lot of flexibility to manage the workforce reductions if required in the future.
We feel really good about where we are, essentially relatively speaking historically we have a good amount of flexibility to adjust the workforce if needed in the future.
John Murphy
Great. Thank you very much.
Joe Hinrichs
Thanks, John.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please proceed.
Brian Johnson
Yes, good morning gentlemen.
Mark Fields
Good morning, Brian.
Brian Johnson
I just want to follow up on that line of questioning around the cycle. If you think about SAAR maybe running, trailing three months 18 million, some of us thought it would be closer to 17 million this year.
Can you give us a sense what is your full-time Tier 1, Tier 2 non-temporary man capacity, what SAAR is that sized for, what SAAR could you go up to in terms of temporary workforce without adding any full time people? And then on the downside, what percent downside could you handle under the old Tier 2 supplemental.
Well, first of all could you clarify that it's a supplemental benefit that Tier 2 enjoyed before they are not stepping up to Tier 1 and then what SAAR could you handle on the downside?
Robert Shanks
Do you want me to take that?
Mark Fields
Yes. At least part of it.
Robert Shanks
Most of our plants are running near max capacity but not all of them. And then of course as it was answered in the prior question, Brian, we have picked up additional flexibility around capacity if we need it going forward.
So I think we still as Joe mentioned in his comments we still have some room to manage further upside in terms of industry volume. Do you want to handle the rest of that?
Bill Dirksen
Yes, I think on a downturn scenario I guess first of all, first of all would be to try to ride our attrition curve to not have to impact employees where we don't need to. But if it comes to that, we do have stable income security agreements as Joe mentioned earlier which would allow us to adjust our workforce down in a fairly cost effective way.
And that is because the new employees are the lower seniority, in-progression employees and they would be the first ones to be impacted in the event of a downturn.
Brian Johnson
So just my recollection of subs was it's about a half year to full year at some pay and then another half year at part pay or exactly could you spell out how that works?
Bill Dirksen
Yes, for the in-progression employees it maxes out at 26 weeks of sub pay and that's roughly 74% of their pay. So that's what the in-progression employees will be eligible for at the top end.
Brian Johnson
Okay. And then finally, any greater ability to move people between plants to respond to shifts in consumer take rates on different size and type vehicles?
Bill Dirksen
I think we will continue to have good flexibility to move people across operations. We've had that in the last few agreements and I think we'll continue to have that.
Brian Johnson
Okay. Thank you.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Brian.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed.
Colin Langan
Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just first question, the $600 million in expense for this year with the bonus being 8,500 with 53,000 workers I get around 450. What is the additional costs that you're incurring this year or expecting [ph] for?
Robert Shanks
Well, the ratification bonus isn't 8,500 I think for 10,000 - 8,500. But then we also have we're going to backdate the wages back to the time that the contract expired and then there's some impact also on benefits that we'll pickup in the quarter. But the majority of the $600 million as you mentioned is around the ratification bonus.
Colin Langan
Okay. And is there any change to pensions, because I notice there's a 250 retired annual payment, is that going to show up in the gap pension or is that a one-time cost nature?
Robert Shanks
There is no change in the defined benefits plan. We did increase the contribution to the defined contribution plan as Mark mentioned in his comments. And I think we're still sorting through how we would handle the $250 in terms of how that's paid but if they were to come from pensions we would fund it.
Colin Langan
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Ryan Brinkman
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.
Mark Fields
Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan Brinkman
So I think it's a very good result to have labor cost inflation of less than 1.5% per year, as you say probably not much different than general inflation. I'm curious why when analysts and investors looked at the points of the contract that were available prior to today and maybe even now with the details it seems on the face of it like more of an increase. And might it be that the use of the more overtime or temporary workers or some other factor is perhaps more of a benefit than is readily apparent from the outside?
And then can you confirm that the 1.5% figure is an all-in wages and benefits number that includes benefits? And what assumptions if any were made about profit-sharing in getting to that 1.5%?
Mark Fields
John?
John Fleming
I think a couple of points. You're right, there were offsetting opportunities in the agreement that allowed us to reduce costs. Certainly the increase in temporary people helped significantly to offset some of the cost. So I think that's that particular piece on how we're going to account for it, Bob, is there --
Robert Shanks
Well I mean in terms of the 1.5% it's all in, so it's wages, it's benefits, it's ratification bonuses, it's the lump sums, it includes everything. And what was the other part of the question?
Profit sharing, yes what we assumed is we held the 2014 actual profit sharing flat right through the period. Because obviously that's a variable compensation number and we certainly hope it goes up and are working very hard to make it go up. But for purposes of comparison and this is what we've done years past when we've done this we hold it flat.
Ryan Brinkman
Okay, very helpful. Thanks a lot. Great result.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Ryan.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Rod Lache
Good morning everybody. A couple of things. I think that Ford has said that your UAW was averaging around $57.70 an hour in 2014. FCA was at $47.50 and of course Mexico and other regions were significantly below that.
I guess first just to clarify, are you suggesting that there's convergence with your domestic peers because their labor inflation is greater than the 1.5%? Is that essentially it that your cost per hour will only go up by 1.5% but theirs is a sharper increase?
Mark Fields
By our calculations, Rod, what we see is effectively during the contract period the gap with GM is eliminated and the gap with FCA is significantly narrowed.
Rod Lache
Okay. And your UAW labor cost, if it was in the $5.7 billion range you're suggesting that it's only a 1.5% increase or something like that $80 million to $90 million. Is that fair?
Robert Shanks
Yes, we said less than 1.5% per year including a ratification bonus.
Rod Lache
Okay. Can you just provide some views on what the average worker age is right now and what actually is the average rate of attrition?
And then just from my last question would be just from a very high level obviously the expansions that are going on in Mexico are considerably lower. The thinking is that American companies have - US companies have $2,400, $2,500 average labor cost per vehicle and Mexico labor is like $500 or something.
Just can you just give us some high level thoughts on how the company views the path to improving competitiveness in that context and whether this gives you any flexibility there?
Mark Fields
So Bill, why don't you take the first part of it.
Bill Dirksen
Let me - the first part of it just from an average age standpoint for our entry level or in-progression employees the average age is in the early 30s. For legacy employees average age is in the late 40s. Our attrition while I don't have an exact number to share in terms of the percentage currently or forecast what I can tell you is it's going to increase from what it has been over the course of the agreement.
And then into the next agreement as well based on our demographics we see our attrition rate escalating in the years to come.
Mark Fields
And Rod, to your second question as I mentioned in the opening remarks one of the key agreements that we've made in this new contract is we've really maintained that flexibility to take a look at our global manufacturing footprint overall to improve our cost competitiveness on products that we may sell in North America.
Or in other words in this contract we're not restricted from sourcing products anywhere in the Ford world for sale in the US as long as we're meeting our US sourcing commitment. So I think you can expect us to look at our overall competitiveness in North America through that lens.
Rod Lache
Got it. Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover of Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Matt Stover
I have a few questions here. Thank you for taking them. The first thing I want to talk about is just the offsets to the wage inflation, because I was surprised that's an all-in number given, maybe do the rough math on the headline wage increases it's almost 1.5 and then you have inflation bonuses, lump sums - and then you have uncapped on the profit. And then you have transition of the in-transition workers to the traditional healthcare benefits.
So I was wondering if you could offer some greater clarity as to what other items might have been on the favorable side of that and your ability to manage wage costs?
Mark Fields
Okay. Joe do you want to take that?
Joe Hinrichs
Yes, well first off the elimination of the cap for the in-progression employees actually spreads out that growth across eight years as opposed to previously you would have had to have been converting people to the legacy rate after the end of four years depending on how many people we hired. So that effect is in there and you kind of don't see it but it's in there.
We were already at the level of at the cap of the entry level. So we would have been converting people to legacy in the near term as we're hiring people to grow. And so you're seeing that smoothing out of that happen over the next four to eight years depending on what timeline.
Also inside our numbers of course are annual efficiencies which we get every year in our manufacturing operations. So that's an offsetting factor of some of the increased cost because we are getting more efficient every year. We continue to see that.
In addition to as has been noted several times the increased use of temporaries for not only absenteeism, vacation, launches, things of that nature where previously those would have been again in the way we are now where we were with the cap we'd have been converting people to higher legacy costs if it made that happen.
In the case of the in-progression workers moving to the legacy healthcare costs in the scheme of things that cost wasn't that substantial when you look at it on an annual basis.
Because they are younger employees, they don't have the same kind of healthcare costs at this point in time that our legacy employees do on a per person basis. So that's also inside of there.
Matt Stover
Okay. And then the second question there was a moratorium on outsourcing. I assume that's just kitting and that sort of thing.
Would that preclude you folks from pursuing something like you did with GM in terms of sharing capital investment on bigger programs like that with another OE or another supplier?
John Fleming
Yes, it's John Fleming. The moratorium that we have is basically on plant closures. On outsourcing itself we use a model that we've used for many years where each time we look at outsourcing we sit down, we put the business case together and then we work with the UAW and come to an agreement.
So we looked at it more as an ongoing process than an actual moratorium and that's what's going to continue as part of this contract.
Matt Stover
Thank you very much.
Mark Fields
Okay. Thanks, Matt.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC. Please proceed.
Joe Spak
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. With the 8 year grow-in on the in-progression employees I guess I just want to understand how to think about that as it bleeds into the next contract. Is that pretty much set in stone or is that something that can come up again in the next contract to be renegotiated to a new level?
Bill Dirksen
Well yes, this is Bill Dirksen. Everything in the contract will expire, at the end of the agreement the entire contract does and will be renegotiated. But the fact that we have articulated a progression that extends eight years is certainly going to be a starting point for all of us as we go into negotiations in '19. And that I think will be the expectation of the UAW and our employees.
So while it expires I think it's fair to say that it's a starting point for the discussions we'll engage in in four years.
Joe Spak
Okay, thanks. And sorry if I missed this but of the 8,500 jobs that are secured or new, how many are new over the time period?
John Fleming
It's John Fleming. We don't know at the moment because it becomes a net figure. So we know that there's 8,500 new jobs, but they will be offset, some of them by ongoing efficiencies, to leave us with a net number, and we won't know what that finally that net number is until we get towards the end of the contract.
Joe Spak
Okay. And then just a last one on the other side, you mentioned outsourcing, are there any planned in-sourcing activities in those incremental jobs?
John Fleming
Yes, there are many in-sourcing opportunities and we'll continue to go through. We're always looking at what makes the most business sense and where it makes sense to bring our work in we will do it and where it makes sense for work to go out we will also work on that --
Robert Shanks
That's the same process you talked about…
John Fleming
Same process as before, yes.
Joe Spak
Thanks a lot, guys.
Mark Fields
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. Please proceed.
David Whiston
Thanks, good morning. Two questions.
Mark Fields
Good morning.
David Whiston
First, on the excise tax for affordable healthcare just reading the contract summaries between your contract and GM's there was some language in GM's that talked about how there is an open window midway through the agreement that they would come back to the table and possibly discuss changes. I didn't see that language in your summary. So what's going to happen in 2018 when that tax hits?
Bill Dirksen
We have very similar language to both GM and FCA on this. And essentially if we have many healthcare plans, all of us do, and if any of our plans were to draw the excise tax when it becomes effective in 2018 then those plans are eligible for deductibles to be put in place as a way to offset the cost of the excise tax.
But we don't know here in 2015 which plans might draw that tax a couple of years down the track. But as far as comparison across the companies it's very similar language on the element of the agreements.
David Whiston
Okay. Thanks. I know we're talking today about basically reducing the cost gap with the Detroit three competitors but longer term do you still want to try and get parity with the transplants?
Mark Fields
Well, absolutely. I mean, right now as we look at this at least our projections for this contract is our gap versus the transplants remains pretty consistent. And that really motivates us to continue to look for efficiencies in every element of our business, whether it be manufacturing or every other element, and at the same time making sure we're working on bringing compelling products the marketplace that could garner higher transaction prices and higher profitability.
But clearly competitiveness is something that we are focused on day in and day out. And we're going to continue to work towards that even with this gap that we see being consistent there during the contract period.
David Whiston
Okay. Thank you very much.
Mark Fields
Okay. Thanks, David.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle of Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
Alisa Priddle
Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the call. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. First off, so the 8,500 jobs, none of them are retained jobs, they are all new jobs just as you say pending efficiencies? I just want to clarify that first.
Mark Fields
No. To help clarify it's securing or creating 8,500 jobs. It is not incremental 8,500 jobs.
Alisa Priddle
Okay. But is there sort of any kind of guideline you can give us for how much of that would in fact be new jobs, a percentage, anything?
Mark Fields
No, at this point we'll as John and Bill mentioned we look at during the contract period, we look at things on a case-by-case basis and we'll let that develop over the course of the contract period just like we did in 2011.
Alisa Priddle
Okay. Although I believe at that point you had something like a $12,000 commitment to create jobs by the end of that term so there isn't sort of a similar kind of commitment in this one?
Mark Fields
The commitment in this agreement is to either secure or created and we're not giving - at this point we're not giving any detail as to which one falls into each bucket because that will depend on the situation of the company as we continue to grow.
John Fleming
Just to reconfirm that in '11 it was exactly the same, it was exactly the same terms of reference.
Alisa Priddle
Okay. And then the temporary workers, how many temporary workers do you have now and what kind of gains do you project there?
Bill Dirksen
Well in terms of our temporary workforce, it fluctuates pretty dramatically. We have a lot more in the summertime when we have summer vacation replacements. But I think it would be fair to say that we will have significantly more in the future.
Because as part of this agreement we are going to not only be using temporary and part time employees for summer vacation replacement also for short-term needs like product launches and importantly also to cover certain types of employee absenteeism going forward. And that will provide the opportunity to have that portion of the workforce be at a higher level than it has been in the past.
Alisa Priddle
And was that because of the cap before that you couldn't use it for product launches as liberally as you wanted to?
Bill Dirksen
No, we really didn't have a cap before. I think we just have more clarity in the agreements that we've put together in partnership with the UAW this round of negotiations.
Alisa Priddle
Sorry, I meant the cap on moving people up to the top tier.
Bill Dirksen
No, they're really unrelated.
Mark Fields
That's not linked to this. That's clearly focused on the entry level or what's known as the in-progression workers and in this agreement we've eliminated that cap.
Alisa Priddle
Right, no, I realize that. I'm saying in the past, though, temporary workers would have moved people up? I'm trying to see if that's the savings.
Bill Dirksen
I think the important thing here is that we are going to have the opportunity to employ more temporary workers than we have in the past because we have clarity in the situations that we have defined very specifically about how those employees would be used.
So based on those new set of agreements we will be able to employ more which will help us with our staffing flexibility and also to blend our labor cost down.
Alisa Priddle
All right. Thank you very much.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Alisa.

The next question comes from the line of Bernie Woodall of Thomson Reuters. Please proceed.
Bernie Woodall
Good morning and thank you.
Mark Fields
Good morning, Bernie.
Bernie Woodall
Hey, you mentioned broadly the production changes as far as investment is $9 billion in the US. Can you talk specifically yet about where the product that was at the Wayne plant, the Michigan assembly plant, will be going? The UAW has clearly said it's going to Mexico and so far the Company has refrained from saying that.
Now that it's signed can you say where that's going to go? And secondly with the absenteeism’s you mentioned your temps are going to be helping cover certain type of absenteeism’s. Do you believe that a new absenteeism policy will result in some higher attrition where you can take advantage of hiring lower paid workers?
And finally, I guess you've already answered this in a way but if the industry falls flat or goes negative in four years is the eight-year grow-in off the table? Thanks.
Joe Hinrichs
Hey, Bernie, good morning, this is Joe. For competitive reasons we're not announcing or don't plan to announce right now what our plans are for the Focus production.
We have clearly said that our intention is to move it to a lower cost location when the next vehicle comes out. We will have more to say on that as we get closer. Very importantly we spent a significant amount of time with the UAW in these negotiations talking about Michigan assembly plant.
And finally talking about the overall competitiveness of our footprint and the products we build and where we build them. And I think we came to the right conclusion in the agreement with all this $9 million investment we certainly are committing to a significant investment here in the US.
But we need to also have some flexibility to move some of our smaller products to other locations which as Mark highlighted in the beginning we intend to do. But there's nothing to announce today on the products for Michigan assembly plant or on where the next generation focus will be built.
Mark Fields
John or Bill do you want to take the absenteeism question?
Bill Dirksen
Sure. There were some minor changes made to our absenteeism policy. We don't really see that leading to a significant increase in attrition. What we hope is that it will lead to better attendance and that's the point of any good attendance policy. So that's our plan for that.
Mark Fields
And just lastly, Bernie, to your question on is the [aid-in] grow-in period off the table if the economy goes south. First off, that's part of the agreement and no matter what the economic conditions. But I think the important point on that is we think of protecting the Company in the event of a downturn, a couple of things.
One there is an aid-in grow-in period, so that is helpful. Secondly as we said the increased use of temporary workers will help buff it if you will some of the economic downturn scenarios.
And then finally the unchanged layoff benefits, the supplemental unemployment benefits, those three things in particular are I think protect us to a certain degree to the vaguarities [ph] of the economic cycle.
Bernie Woodall
Great. Thanks for your help.
Mark Fields
Okay. Thanks, Bernie.

Hi. I had a couple of – part has put your labor cost, is right all-in labor cost as rising to about $60 an hour at the end of the agreement. I was just wondering how that squares with your own forecast?
And also on the healthcare I was just wondering going to talk’s projection was that healthcare costs would rise about 25% over the next 4 years. I was just wondering if that still stands.
And if given that as we anticipate many of your plans will hit the excise tax and as we come closer to 2018 whether that's an issue that the company will have to revisit with the UAW?
Robert Shanks
Okay. Let me take the first question. Christine, hi. How are you today? The $60 at the center for automotive research has forecasted, that's directionally in line with our view.
Christina Rogers
Okay.
Mark Fields
And then the healthcare, Bill?
Bill Dirksen
As far as the question on healthcare I think as I mentioned before it's really too early to tell which of our plans may or may not be affected by the excise tax in 2018. The cost of the plans are changing all the time and some of the administrative guidelines are as well.
So we're really not in a position to be able to effectively answer that question where we stand today. It's too early.
Christina Rogers
And as far as the impact of this contract on the growth in healthcare costs what are you projecting now? Do you still project them to grow about 25% or how much do you project them to grow annually?
Mark Fields
Christine, we don't provide our views on that. We're always working very hard with the providers to gain efficiencies and the plans are constantly changing as well as we work on that with them. So that's not a number that we provide externally.
Christina Rogers
Okay. Thank you very much.
Mark Fields
Thank you Christina.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Martinez of Detroit News. Please proceed.
Mike Martinez
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This thing was ratified by a pretty slim margin, so there is about 49% opposing it. What does that say to you guys about the expectations of the workforce and where things stand with them right now?
And could you provide a little color into those last few days, and were you guys getting pretty nervous as the final results were coming in?
Mark Fields
Well Mike I think we won't go through the play-by-play on those last couple of days. And I do think when you look at this contract if you look back on the last number of contracts these always tend to be fairly close affairs. And I think at the end of the day we have a contract here that lays a good foundation for the company.
It works for our employees. It supports our One Ford plan and importantly it allows our UAW workers to continue to share in the success of the Company going forward, particularly when you look at the profit-sharing that we've continued in place here.
So overall we think it's a good agreement and as I said these things tend to be close affairs but we're moving forward and we'll move the business forward now.
Mike Martinez
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Naughton of Bloomberg. Please proceed.
Keith Naughton
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mark Fields
Good morning, Keith.
Keith Naughton
So if it you're at $60 with this contract I was just wondering if you could give a specific number of where you calculate that compares to Toyota and Honda? And if you could just be a little more specific, Mark, on how you intend to get competitive with them during the life of this agreement?
Mark Fields
Well, let me take the second part and I will let Bob or Bill take the first one. But it's the way we've done it even versus the last contract where we had a gap versus our competitors.
We're continuing to look at efficiencies, continue to look at cost reductions across the business. But also at the same time keep we're working the revenue side of the equation which is around bringing out very compelling products.
And what you've seen even during over the last contract we've made a lot of progress in terms of our transaction prices, so we're going to work both sides of the profit equation with the revenues and the cost.
Keith Naughton
Thanks.
Robert Shanks
And Keith, in terms of how we compare hourly wage rates it's about an $8 to $10 gap, and we think that is a gap that will continue through the contract period.
Keith Naughton
Thank you.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Keith.

Your next question comes from the lien of Joann Muller of Forbes. Please proceed.
Joann Muller
Hi there. You know I have a question about your global footprint. You talked a little bit about that. And as I look at what's happening not just with you but with some of the other companies as well, it appears that for cost reasons it makes more sense to build the larger, more profitable vehicles here.
But I'm wondering if we're setting up for Groundhog Day should the gas prices rise or should the economy change on lending rates, etc., where suddenly the US is only building large costly vehicles that people don't want. I know we're looking down the road, right now these are all the rage, but it does feel a little bit like Groundhog Day to me.
Mark Fields
Well, thanks for the question, Joann. I think you know our strategy really well in terms of our product approach which is offer a full family of vehicles small, medium and large. And that continues to be our strategy.
And where they're produced US or for leveraging some other parts of our global manufacturing footprint we're going to continue to do that because we want to make sure that we're following the market. And we think we have the product lineup now to do that and the facilities around the world to help us to react to that.
Joann Muller
Okay. But you don't worry about locking yourselves into building only the more expensive vehicles here and then perhaps having a problem five to 10 years down the road?
Mark Fields
Like I said we're comfortable with our plan. Obviously we haven't talked about all elements of it but given one of our tenets of how we run the business as you know is to continually look at that business environment and project out.
So we feel comfortable with how we're positioning the business from that standpoint.
Joann Muller
Okay. Thanks, Mark.
Mark Fields
Thanks, Joann.

Your last question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin of Associated Press. Please proceed.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Good morning. Thanks for taking the call.
Mark Fields
Good morning, Dee-Ann.
Dee-Ann Durbin
I just wanted to – hi, I just want to double check, it sounds like you're not going to give a total number of temporary workers that you have right now.
Mark Fields
Correct.
Dee-Ann Durbin
Okay. Can you say at least do you think by the end of the contract that you will be using more than your competitors, fewer, can you say if you plan to double them or triple them, just give some idea of when you say we're going to use more like what does that really mean?
Bill Dirksen
Well the number of temporary workers we're going to use it's going to really be based on the collective bargaining agreement that we just negotiated and our business needs. We do think it's going to be significantly more. We don't have a specific number to share on that.
We do think, I'm not going to really speak for the other companies to make that comparison in terms of their use of temporary employees. I do think our agreements are similar with the other companies.
But our plan is to expand our use in lines with the agreement that we just negotiated and I think it will be good for the business and I think it will be good for the operations and the workforce as well.
Dee-Ann Durbin
And one more. Is there any concern about maintaining quality with increased use of temporary workers? How can you have people jumping in and out and doing these jobs which are complicated jobs?
John Fleming
Yes, it's John Fleming. We're always concerned about quality and actually that's one of the reasons why having a steady view on temporary workers that can come in and be trained is going to be better for quality in overall terms.
The worst thing that can happen to us is that we're short of people as we try to run on specific days or there's issues where you get to high absenteeism in the plants.
And so having a steady group of temporary and part-time workers will allow us to even all of that out and I believe and our experience tells us it will improve quality.
Mark Fields
And let's keep into perspective in terms of number of temporary workers, how basically the majority of workers are not temporary workers. So I think it's important that to keep in mind the magnitude here.
I just think overall as we look at this agreement why we've said in some of our statements that this agreement makes us stronger and just to wrap up I think there's several considerations around that.
First we reached an agreement without a costly production disruption. We maintained our flexibility around alternative work schedules. We talked about the additional daily overtime and the mandatory weekend overtime.
The cap that we've had for the in-progression folks is now eliminated. As we've talked about we have the ability to use temporary workers in certain circumstances.
And then finally beyond our US sourcing commitments which we're really proud to make we do have the opportunity to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to introduce products for sale here.
So stepping back we think this is a great agreement for our Company, for our employees and help strengthen the business.
Ted Cannis
All right. Thanks very much for your participation. That concludes our call for today.
