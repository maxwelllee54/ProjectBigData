VH1 Unveils New Logo

If VH1's logo on social networks looks different to you, it's because the TV network has given it a face-lift in a new multi-platform rebranding effort that was unveiled Monday.
The plus sign was added into the VH1 lettering, in part, to reflect changes in the digital world. 
"10 years ago, no one had ever heard of Justin Bieber, Mark Zuckerberg  just entered Harvard, iPhones were five years away and hashtags didn't exist," VH1 President Tom Calderone says. "Our world has clearly changed, so we want to reflect those cultural and technological changes in each of the many ways that consumers now touch the VH1 brand." 
The new logo, for example, appears on the bottom right of this promo ad for The Jenny McCarthy Show, with the plus sign integrated separately into the ad art as well:

The plus sign is meant to mesh VH1's music, pop culture and nostalgia content together.
VH1 calls the plus sign a "tagmark" and says it represents the brand's "high-energy sensibility where everything is 'more' â€” more fun, more bold, and more exciting."

The makeover comes after VH1 pulled in solid ratings, increasing primetime viewership by 14% in 2012, on the back of such shows as Mob Wives, Single Ladies and Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. New shows on tap include The Jenny McCarthy Show, Black Ink and Making Mr. Right as well as the return of Best Week Ever.
