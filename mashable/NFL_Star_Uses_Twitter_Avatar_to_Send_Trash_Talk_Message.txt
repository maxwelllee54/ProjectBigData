NFL Star Uses Twitter Avatar to Send Trash Talk Message
Did NFL star Arian Foster just make Twitter avatars the new locker-room bulletin board? 
"Bulletin-board material" is a staple of the sports cliche lexicon,  right up there with "taking it one game at a time" and "giving 110%." It refers to when an upcoming opponent, or a media member — or pretty much anyone — says something disrespectful that can be used as motivation for a future matchup. The quote gets tacked up on the physical — or, more often, just metaphorical — locker-room bulletin board to be seen over and over again as fuel for the competitive fire. 
Now, back to Arian Foster. The Houston Texans' star running back took exception to an article written by Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy. In the piece, Shaughnessy dismisses the Texans as playoff contenders, and characterizes the Patriots' matchup against them this Sunday as essentially a week off. 
So Foster took a portion of the column and, with no fan fare, announcement or public comment, made it his Twitter avatar. Here's his avatar now:
 
Foster has long been among the most active, engaging and entertaining NFL players on Twitter, so it's no big surprise that he'd be the one to do something like this. Still, it's a pretty clever way to use Twitter, and provides a little bit of fun entertainment for fans during the week of hype before the game — much like when cornerback Richard Sherman changed his name on Twitter before another anticipated matchup earlier this season. 
Do you find Foster's stunt entertaining, or is it a wrong move? Give us your take in the comments below.
