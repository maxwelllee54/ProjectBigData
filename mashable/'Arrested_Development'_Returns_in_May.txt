'Arrested Development' Returns in May
Arrested Development fans, your wait is nearly over. The Bluths are set to return for their feverishly anticipated fourth season this May.
The cult favorite went off the air after three seasons, in 2006, but Netflix signed on in 2011 to host new episodes of the show after seeing its immense popularity with subscribers. Executive producer Ron Howard has since tweeted a photo of the new season's script and star Jason Bateman later shared photos from the writers' room. Bateman also shared photos from the set in August. 
But Wednesday's news, revealed at a panel at the 2013 Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, marks the most detailed to date. Season four will consist of 14 episodes, up from 10 as originally planned, and the entire batch will reportedly be released at once. Arrested Development fans will also have to get used a slightly different narrative approach â€” each episode is said to focus primarily on just one character, with only Michael Bluth, played by Bateman, appearing in all 14. 
Arrested Development is Netflix's biggest name exclusively hosted series, but just one of several the company is using to try to shake up the television industry. Five other shows are set to premiere on Netflix this year as well, including House of Cards, produced by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey, and Derek, which Ricky Gervais writes and stars in.
