iHeartRadio Launches Stations Based on Moods, Activities
LAS VEGAS — Popular digital radio service iHeartRadio rolled out a new iPhone and PC update on Monday at the 2013 International CES, giving users a way to create stations based on moods and activities, such as working out or driving to work.
In addition to creating custom stations based on artists and songs or tuning in to its 1,500 live radio channels, users can now search through thousands of new options with a tool called Perfect For — as in, searching for music "perfect for" chilling out, cleaning the house and studying.

Here's how it works: After accessing the latest version of iHeartRadio on your iPhone or PC and selecting the new "Perfect For" tab, the platform presents a menu of moods and activities based on the day and time. This means users will see a different collection of stations in the morning — such as "perfect for" waking up — and might see "caffeinated country" later in the day. When a user picks a mood or activity, several genres or themes appear, including quirky ones such as "Took My Wife, Took My Dog: Country's Greatest Break-up Music" and "Skinny Jeans: Boys with Guitars."
More stations will be added each day, the company said.
iHeartRadio also introduced an alarm clock to compliment its previously launched Sleep Timer, which allows users to fall asleep and wake up to radio stations of their choice.
Although the "perfect for" feature is only available for the iPhone right now, iHeartRadio told Mashable it's working on making it available on other mobile and tablet devices soon.
"The feature will initially be available for iPhones and PCs, but when users sign in on these devices they can save 'Perfect For' channels in their 'My Stations' and access them via any device where iHeartRadio is available," said Brian Lakamp, president of digital at Clear Channel.
