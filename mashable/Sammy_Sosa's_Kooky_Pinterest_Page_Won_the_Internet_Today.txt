Sammy Sosa's Kooky Pinterest Page Won the Internet Today
Sammy Sosa missed out on the Baseball Hall of Fame this week, but he may have just landed a shot at the Internet Hall of Fame. 
The steroid-tainted slugger apparently posted several bizarre, staged and downright creepy shots to his new Pinterest page three weeks ago, but the sports web just stumbled across the trove of Internet gold. In the photos, we see Sosa relaxing on a couch, pointing in multiple directions and posing awkwardly — or is that casually? — against various pieces of furniture. 
It's hard to tell what to love most about the photos — Sosa's penetrating gaze, frozen smile or the the fact that all fourteen photos are of Sammy alone and have the exact same caption: "Sammy Sosa. Yes, I'm the real Sammy Sosa, and this is my Pinterest."
Now is this actually Sammy Sosa's Pinterest? Probably. The photos posted there can also also be found on Sosa's equally amazing Flickr page, and one is the profile shot for his Twitter page, which features a number of candid family shots and is in fact the real deal, according to a recent Chicago Tribune article. 
Anyway, enough skepticism. Just take a deep breath and behold some of the majesty that is Slammin' Sammy's surreal Pinterest garden:
1. Peace

2. When Sammy Met Barry

3. Don't Look at Me. Look Over There While I Make a Quick Conference Call

4. Srsly?

5. "Sammy Sosa. Yes, I'm the real Sammy Sosa, and this is my Pinterest."
