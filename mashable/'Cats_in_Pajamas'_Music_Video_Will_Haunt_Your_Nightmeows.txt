'Cats in Pajamas' Music Video Will Haunt Your Nightmeows

Oakland, Calf.-based band GnarBoots hacked up a hairball of bizarre to create the music video for their tune, "Cats in Pajamas." Cats, pajamas â€” what could go wrong? So much.
The peculiar video looks like a scene out of a child's nightmare, or possibly a scene cut from Donnie Darko. Either way, it's something you won't forget.
