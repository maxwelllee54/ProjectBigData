'Star Trek Into Darkness' Mobile App Will Blast off During Super Bowl
Movie studio Paramount has teamed up with Qualcomm to create a new app for the upcoming film Star Trek Into Darkness. Announced at CES 2013, the app uses context-aware technologies to bring specific information to users at specific times.
When the app launches at the end of January, fans will be able to get special Star Trek Into Darkness content, such as videos, photos and wallpaper delivered directly to the mobile device.
That sort of functionality is standard fare for promotional apps for tentpole films. To kick things up a notch, the Star Trek Into Darkness app will also be able to unlock exclusive content and interactive features.
The first opportunity to unlock content will come during the second quarter of the Super Bowl during an airing of a Star Trek Into Darkness TV spot. The app will use audio recognition to deliver content to users watching the ad on Super Bowl Sunday.

Leading up to the release of the film, the app will continue to unlock new surprises and features. It will also use image scan functionality to interact with printed images and billboards for the film. Additionally, there are going to be location-based experiences within the app.
While using a smartphone app during a Super Bowl ad isn't totally new, this is the first time we've seen such a broad-based digital campaign built into a smartphone app.
Star Trek Into Darkness opens in theaters May 17, 2013. If you want to get notified of the Into Darkness app's availability, as well as enter a contest to win a VIP trip to the film's U.S. premiere, go to StarTrekMovie.com/CES.
