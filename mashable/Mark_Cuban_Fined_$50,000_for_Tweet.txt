Mark Cuban Fined $50,000 for Tweet
Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneurial icon Mark Cuban is in hot water with the NBA again, this time over some costly comments he made on Twitter. 
The league fined Cuban $50,000 on Tuesday for a tweet he posted after his Mavericks lost at home to the lowly New Orleans Hornets on Saturday. Here is the tweet in question: 
Im sorry NBA fans. Ive tried for 13 yrs to fix the officiating in this league and I have failed miserably. Any Suggestions ? I need help

The $50,000 fine comes out to just over $367 per character for the 136-character tweet, but that's just chump change to Cuban, whose net worth tops $2 billion. It's the rough equivalent of a $1 fine for someone earning $40,000 per year. 
Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000. According to the Dallas Morning News, he's been docked a total of some $2 million in the 13 years since. 
Cuban is exceptionally outspoken and candid on Twitter for a billionaire sports team owner, so it's not entirely surprising that his tweeting thumbs — rather than his sharp tongue — did him in this time. 
But for all that trash talk, there's one team's fan base he says he won't mess with online — the Los Angeles Lakers. 
“There is more Twitter courage in Southern California than probably any other part of the world," Cuban said in November. “I could say ‘Kobe tied his shoe laces wrong’ and I’d probably get death threats on Twitter.”
