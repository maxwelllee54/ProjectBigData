LG Sets Price on Its 55" OLED TV and It's a Doozy

LAS VEGAS — LG announced that its high-end WRGB OLED TV is making its way to the United States.
Ever since HDTVs reached the majority of U.S. households, TV manufacturers have searched for new ways to get those big margins back on the models they sell. It didn't work with 3D, so now they're looking to new technologies to help them out. LG has high hopes for high prices in OLED displays, and it just set a big price on its 55-inch model.
The set will cost $12,000 when it becomes available in March this year. That's pretty steep — especially considering the set is a 1080p display and not one of the newer Ultra HD 4K TVs.
However, the OLED set brings to the table the technology's super-slim profile (it's extremely thin for a 55-inch set) as well as impressive brightness, which produces eye-popping color. We saw the set in the flesh at LG's press conference at CES 2013, and there's no question it produces an incredible picture.
Is it $12,000 of incredible, though? You tell us. Would you pay that much for a TV, even if it was the most lifelike picture ever? Tell us in the comments.
It's not even 4K but the OLED screen might make it worthwhile for cinephiles.
Welcome to 4K UltraHD.
