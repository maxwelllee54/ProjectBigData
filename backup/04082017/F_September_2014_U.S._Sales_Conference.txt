Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Ford Monthly Sales Conference Call. My name is Lacy, and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate periodic Q&A session throughout this conference. (Operator Instructions)
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Erich Merkle, U.S Sales Analyst. Please proceed.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Lacy. And we’re going to start things off. I am going to turn it over to John first, because we have got some exciting news to tell everybody about our team today.
John Felice
Well, Erich, thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we talk to the sales number this morning, it’s my pleasure to share an announcement on behalf of the company. With us today, Emily Kolinski Morris is now Ford's Chief Economist effective today.
Emily joined Ford in 1997 covering foreign exchange markets in the Asia-Pacific region in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. In her 16 years with the company, she also held the position of Senior European Economist and has worked in the Treasury Affiliate Finance, as well as Research and Advanced Engineering.
She also currently serves on the Board of Directors of the National Association for Business Economics and has previously served as the President of the Detroit Chapter of that organization.
Emily takes over Chief Economist role from Ellen Huges-Cromwick who is retiring after 18 years of great service to Ford Motor Company. She was recognized as a prominent economist in the profession. Ellen won several forecasting and another awards during her career at Ford. She was also elected President of the National Association for Business Economics in 2007 through 2008.
As those on this call know, Ellen has been often quoted in the media and invited to speak at top economic and industry conferences worldwide. So, on behalf of the company, all of us wish Ellen to great enjoyment and success in the years ahead and welcome Emily to her new role. Emily congratulations.
Emily Kolinski Morris
Thank you very much, John.
John Felice
We are so happy to have you on the team. And with that, I’d like to turn it back to Erich and let’s go through the sales numbers for this month.
Erich Merkle
Great. Congratulations Emily. Thank you, John. Reviewing early incoming data, we estimate total sales, including medium and heavy trucks likely closed out September in the mid to high 16 million vehicle range on the seasonally adjusted annualized basis. This would mean absolute sales totaled approximately 1.265 million to 1.275 million vehicles, providing an industry increase of approximately 10% compared to last September.
It was another solid month for retail as retail represented about 84% of total sales last month. We estimate the retail SAAR operated right around the 14 million vehicle mark in September. The industry continues to be strong with the last six months SAAR averaging right around 17 million vehicles, including medium and heavy trucks.
Taking a look at some industry details, full-sized pickups had a very good month at almost 13.5% of the overall industry. This is over a 4-point higher than a year ago. We have seen some very strong competitive increases in incentive spend in the segment, but average transaction prices are still running above year ago levels by about $1800.
Small utilities represented approximately 17.1% of the industry last month, as with previous month’s small utilities are about 2 percentage points higher than year ago. Nothing really new here other than the rotation to small utilities continues and should continue this year before slowing perhaps just a bit as we get into next year.
Pressure continues to mount on small cars representing just under 20% of the industry last month. This about a 1.5 lower than a year ago. Mid-size cars continue to be relatively flat with year-to-date levels at approximately 16%. Pricing in the three segments, passenger cars, utilities and pickups differed in September.
As passenger cars average transaction prices were down about $200 relative to last year, utilities segment ATPs were up about $400 over last year while full-size pickup ATPs increased by about $1800. ATPs are largely a function of simple supply and demand. Utilities and full-size pickup trucks are in greater demand relative to passenger cars right now. That gives you a very quick look of the industry overall.
With that, let’s turn things over to John to provide you with some additional Ford and Lincoln color on the month of September. John?
John Felice
Well, thank you, Erich. September sales at Ford Motor Company totaled 180,175, down 3% year-over-year based on a decline in fleet sales. Our fleet sales were off 14%, while retail sales were up 2% versus a year ago. Sales to daily rental companies were down 40% last month, our commercial sales were up 2%, while government sales were up 5%.
Our retail sales continue to be tampered by lower F-Series volume. F-Series represents approximately 30% of our business and it was down 1% as we carefully manage our inventory levels. This is a changeover to the all-new F-150. As we’ve explained on previous calls, our plan to pull back in daily rental sales and lower F-Series volumes are going to tamper our sales a bit for the remainder of this year.
In car news, Fusion sales continue to push higher setting its fifth straight monthly record. Retail sales drove the total again last month, up 11%, providing Fusion with its best ever September sales performance. Total Fusion sales were up 9%. Fusion’s aspirational design in great fuel economy is resonating well on some of the largest midsize passenger car markets in the country, specifically California and Texas.
California is responsible for more than 20% of the Fusion retail sales growth this year, which is more than any other state. Texas, the second largest state for midsize sedans behind California, is responsible for 14% of the retail sales increase for Fusion this year. Last month some of the largest retail sales increases came from San Francisco, up 32% and Houston, which provided a 38% increase.
Transition to SUVs, America’s bestselling midsize utility, Ford Explorer, posted the 1% increase with 13,770 vehicles sold last month. This represents Explorer’s best September sales performance since 2006. Our momentum continued with Transit Connect, sales were up 30% providing its best ever September sales performance.
We are all very excited to have started shipping the all-new 2015 Ford Mustang late last month. We recorded our first retail sale in September at the very end of the month and we are very well-positioned with our '14 model year sale down with only 4,400 units remain in stock. I can tell you that we were with our dealers in Las Vegas for our annual meetings and they are very excited as our customers eager to take delivery of the all-new 2015 Mustang.
Now taking a closer look at Lincoln. At Lincoln, total sales were up 12% providing its with our best September sales since 2010. The increase was driven by retail sales, with sales up 21% on a year-over-year basis. Our all-new Lincoln MKC continues its momentum with 1,763 vehicles sold in September and again they are moving very quickly off dealer lots. Days to turn for MKC was just 15 days and we are pleased to see the continued momentum building behind MKC as well as the broader Lincoln brand.
Overall we continue to be very balanced in our approach to our business. Our inventories are well-managed and right where they should be, as we continue to work through our record number of new vehicle launch introductions this year.
Well that’s a quick look at Ford and Lincoln. And with that, I would like to turn things over to Emily, our new Chief Economist, for outlook of the economic front. Emily?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Okay, John. Thank you and thanks for that really kind introduction today. We are seeing continued momentum from the incoming U.S. economic data, including a further upward revision to second quarter GDP growth with the final print of 4.6% annual rate.
Looking ahead, favorable indicators include continued robust manufacturing activity and growth in investment spending, gradually improving employment conditions with modest income growth and stabilization in potential modest gains in housing with recent improvements in builder confidence.
These incoming indicators coupled with the support of policy backdrop should continue to provide positive momentum for the economy here in the second half. So let’s look briefly at some of the details of recent releases.
Out this morning, the September Purchasing Managers Index declined 2.4 points to 56.6, are off of August three-year high level. Among the component indices, new orders declined but remained well in positive territory and the production component remains steady.
Although, we saw decline in the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index this month, the final September data from the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index broke out of its recent range, extending the gains we saw in the mid-month release to reach a seven-year high of 84.6.
The gain in September was entirely attributed to the expectations component, which historically indicates support for future gains in consumer spending. Real income expectations were also more favorable, a key element that have been dragging our confidence during this recovery. And the income data are improving though modestly. Our personal income rose 0.003% from the prior month in August, returning to growth rate seen in the second quarter after July’s slight deceleration.
Further data on household income from the census we released last month showed median household income stabilizing, though still about 8% below pre-recession levels. And also a decline in the poverty rate for the same time since 2006.
So while there are still shortcomings in the labor market, conditions have continued to improve gradually and the new claims for unemployment insurance remains just below 300,000 on a four-week moving average basis, supporting good job gains, averaging in excess of 200,000 a month for the year-do-date with September’s report, of course due out this Friday.
Developments in the housing market have been somewhat more favorable in recent weeks, though still consistent with only a modest recovery. New home sales picked up in August rising above 500,000 on a start basis, up 18% from July and 33% from the prior year, while existing home sales retreated slightly from the July level which have been highest this year and were down 5.3% from the prior year, but with some rotation towards first time buyer as investor activity receded a bit. Home prices continued to rise, providing some support for household balance sheet as well.
August housing start also retreated from relatively robust levels in the prior month but remained 8% higher than a year ago at 956,000 units on a start basis. And then the forward-looking indicator from the NAHB survey of Builder Confidence in September reached its highest level since 2005, with current conditions and buyer traffic both posting solid gains.
And to recap on the industry as Eric mentioned earlier, September total industry sales are estimated in the mid to high 16 million unit range. That’s at a seasonally adjusted rate including medium and heavy-duty trucks, with the six month average of sales right at 17 million units.
Good macroeconomic fundamentals including robust manufacturing activity, improving income growth and continued low interest rates have contributed to this positive trend. And our 2014 industry sales projections remain as indicated at our Investor Day event earlier this week. So, we continued to see total U.S. industry sales moving to the upper end of the 16.3 to 16.8 million unit range this year, and for next year between 16.8 and 17.5 million units, again including medium and heavy trucks.
So with that summary, let me turn it back over to Erich to kickoff the Q&A today.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Emily. And Lacy, we are going to start with Q&A. We are going to start with focus on the analyst community first.
Question-And-Answer session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson representing Barclays. Please proceed.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Hi. Good morning, Dan Levy on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. First question for the industry, is there any evidence that sales were pulled ahead into August because of the strong Labor Day weekend and also around the strong promotional activity by some of your competitors at the end of the month?
John Felice
Dan, good morning. When you take a look at the month of the September, we saw very similar pattern as we did a year ago. August was a very big month. Last month, with the 79, came down a little bit this month. And again, it was a very strong closed August. So the month of September got off to a little bit of a slower start, but still very strong in the mid. We expect to be in the mid to upper $16 million as our range.
So, again, it might be a little bit of a switch in terms of the tempo between the two months, but bottom line the fundamental looks very sound. And again, the six-month growing average is closer to that $17 million as our range. So as Emily shared, we believe the industry is quite sound.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Okay, great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the truck side, just looking for some color on the truck incentive spend because I saw mid-month that incentive spend data indicated that your spend was around $4,300 in August -- in September, which looks like it was the highest level since last November. Was this simply an attempt to maintain share in the face of some aggressive spend by some of your competitors? I'm just a little surprised that you have this higher spend in the heart of your changeover, especially if inventory levels are okay.
John Felice
Yeah, Dan. I will turn things over to Erich and share some of the data and insight on F-150. But yeah, if you look at the incentive spent, it was up sequentially, slight amount from August to September. But still remains as we have all year, well below a year ago levels in terms of overall incentive spent and the lowest in the segment in spent.
So again, I’ll turn it to Erich in a moment maybe to share some color, commentary. But clearly, we did see in the month of September strong competitive activity in incentive spent, which in turn move the segment quite higher. But again as we’ve said, we are right on -- right where we had plan to be with our changeover to this wonderful to F-150 for 2015. And we are going to provide great value to consumers and be competitive in the marketplace. But at the same time be very discipline in our approach to manage this changeover. And with that Erich any…?
Erich Merkle
Yeah. Sure. I can give you a few specifics on that, Dan. So if you take a look at our F-series incentives, they declined about a $160 compared to September of last year. And our incentives averaged about $4,300 per truck. That is the lowest incentive spent of the three major truck makers. So again, we’ve remained very well disciplined in our incentives. And we are going to -- we have to continue to monitor the competitive environment. The competitive environment was very aggressive and we are just going to continue to manage that process and manage our inventories as we to go through the transition.
Sorry, Dan. Just one last comment. It’s not uncommon to see sequential increase in full-size pickup spending as you go from August to September because traditionally, September and October is a promotional period around truck in the industry here in the U.S. It was only $280 sequentially.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Got it. Is there a floor level of share that you are looking to maintain in the segment?
Erich Merkle
I wouldn’t say a floor. Again we’re going to manage to the business. We have the bestselling truck in the market today. And we are managing through this changeover, but no floor that we have established. We remain competitive in the market and continue our leadership position. We really have the focus on the changeover managing our inventory, Dan. So that’s our focus.
Dan Levy - Barclays
Great. Thank you very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Dan.
John Felice
Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Lacy, next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Liz Suzuki - Bank of America
Good morning. This is Liz Suzuki on for John. Can you comment on what are your total incentives as a percent of ATP have been trending both in September and year-to-date? There was a report out from TrueCar and they estimated that Ford's incentives as a percent of ATP were up a full percentage point to just over 10%, so I wanted to get a sense of whether you think that's accurate?
John Felice
Yeah. I’m just taking a look here. Liz, I’m sorry, Liz. Give me one moment. I mean, so if we take a look, we are running -- we’ve been running about right around the 11%. Okay. And the industry is right around 9%.
Liz Suzuki - Bank of America
Okay. And is that just for September or that’s year-to-date?
John Felice
This is for September, I don’t have year-to-date in front of me.
Liz Suzuki - Bank of America
Okay. All right. We can follow up on that later. And is -- just one quick other one. Is Fusion cannibalizing sales of other Ford cars on either side of the size spectrum, because it looks like all of the other blue oval brand cars were down pretty meaningfully year-over-year?
John Felice
Well, actually, we are very pleased with the performance on Fusion. Again, I’m going to isolate it back to retail because we have mentioned earlier in the call we had a pretty significant decline with daily rental down 40%. But looking at retail sales along with car line up is -- where you get a lot of cross-shop between small utility, C/D car, Fusion and Focus.
Focus sales -- retail sales were up 17%, Fusion sales were up 11% and Escape sales were up 8% retail. So, again, when you look at the pure retail and what is happening in the showroom floor, we are seeing good response across our whole portfolio of super segment vehicles.
Liz Suzuki - Bank of America
Great. Thanks. That’s helpful.
John Felice
Okay. Thank you, Liz. Lacy our next caller please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed.
Justin Barell - Citi
Hey. This is Justin Barell for Itay. How are you guys?
John Felice
Good. How are you doing Justin?
Justin Barell - Citi
Not bad. So, just some quick questions with regards to the ATPs, just hoping that you can maybe provide the overall industry-wide industry for ATPs and incentives?
John Felice
Sure. I can do that. So, if we take a look at industry incentive spend level, they were up about $250 for September on a year-over-year basis, compared with September of 2013, I am sorry, just have to look at the numbers here, okay. So, sequentially, they were down though about $30, okay, average transaction prices, however, so if you look at ATPs, they were up about $800 from a year ago and up about $890 relative to August.
Justin Barell - Citi
And then, how does that stack up for compact and mid-sized cars, just year-over-year and month-over-month, if you have the data available?
John Felice
I don’t have it split out that far, but what I gave you earlier in my upfront talking point, that is, we had about $400 increase in ATPs on utilities for the industry about -- and for cars is down about $200. I can help you out with more details offline though if you like.
Justin Barell - Citi
Yes. That sounds great. Perfect. Thanks guys for the questions.
John Felice
Sure. No problem. Lacy, our next caller please?
Operator
And at this time, we have no further analysts in queue.
John Felice
Okay. Great. We are going to turn things over to the folks in the media then.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey representing The Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.
Mike Ramsey - The Wall Street Journal
Good morning. I -- it sounds like everybody is very confident about the economy going into next year and there doesn’t seem to be any slowdown. It seems like there was some tension, I know a lot of the guys who went before me, their outfits are all concerned that we’ve hit peak auto and that we are really like stoking demand past what’s really there? Could, John or Emily, could you guys talk about where we are in the cycle? Do you really think that we have more, it seems like you do think we have more room to run?
Emily Kolinski Morris
Sure. Yes. Mike, I would be happy to talk about that a little bit. I think, on previous calls we have also noted that, we are certainly reaching a point where the rate of growth in industry sales is beginning to moderate. So, we are getting closer to what would be likely plateau in terms of the industry sales pace. But at the same time we think at those levels the industry does remain very well supported, again when we look at the physicals underlying the sources of new vehicle demand and particularly the fact that the latest Polk data just came out within the past week or so. The average age of vehicle on the road is still by 11.4 years.
Mike Ramsey - The Wall Street Journal
And the one follow-up I had, John, at what point do you -- are you concerned the most about Chrysler right now in terms of competitor? They seem to be gaining a lot of share particularly in the SUV market? Is that something that you -- do you have to specifically fight back against particular competitors or do you just look at the marketplace and say this is where we have to compete?
John Felice
Well, Mike, it’s the latter, we work our plan and based, again, this year is a transitional year for us as we go through the biggest change over new product that we had and don’t really pick on any one competitor, but monitored the marketplace in its totality and remain competitive.
Mike Ramsey - The Wall Street Journal
Okay. Great. Thanks.
John Felice
Okay. Thank you, Mike. Lacy, our next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin, representing the Associated Press. Please proceed.
Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press
Hi, guys. Thank you very much. I have -- GM is suggesting that the light-duty Silverado outsold the F-150 in September. I’m wondering if you can break out F-150 sales. And also, are you seeing any sort of change? And we’ve talked a lot before about how loyal truck buyers are. But with the discounting at Chrysler and GM, did you see -- did you lose more truck share than is typical just because of the dynamics at the market right now? And also if you could talk briefly about Escape and why it’s not performing little bit better? Thanks.
John Felice
Dee-Ann, hopefully, I will get all three of these right, but…
Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press
Sorry.
John Felice
… you still remind me.
Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press
Okay.
John Felice
Well, first of all was on the leadership piece, well, we don’t have the full numbers from the industry yet, so I’m going to speak to ourselves. But speaking through the figures through August of this year, last month we outsold Silverado by almost 19,000 trucks, 18,908 to be specific with the lower incentive spend. And on year-to-date, F-Series sales of almost 500,000 units, again year-to-date through August. And we have exceeded Chevy Silverado by approximately 165,000. So again, we will see what happens in September, but we’ve maintained our leadership lead by a wide margin this year.
I think your second question was more on loyalty. And again, obviously, as we have highlighted the segment was very strong fueled by competitive incentive spend. We fell just short of 60,000 F-150 -- excuse me F-Series total sales of this month, which was very solid. And the trend data we have seen, all this year we’ve seen a very consistent level of loyalty to our brand. We have the strongest pickup truck in the marketplace and our customers have been very, very loyal. So we haven’t seen a lot of change in conquest happening there.
And the last, Escape, again I will come back to that, maybe even broaden, it’s a broader super segment. Again, if you look at the total sales, you could walk away with a bit of a misleading message this month, because taking Escape sales, while in total they were down 4%, fleet sales, again predominantly rental were down 46%. We had a very strong retail month, up 8%. And we continue with both Fusion and Escape to really take advantage of those products in the marketplace.
Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press
Thank you very much.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Dee-Ann. Lacy, our next caller please.

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Snavely with Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press
Hi, and thanks for taking the call and the question. I wondered -- I haven’t been on all of the sales calls this year. I wanted to see if you could sort of go back over fleet sales and why your fleet sales were down and why you’re taking that action and then maybe that also helps to explain. I was going to ask about Escape as well, but Fiesta, Focus, and Edge are all down as well for total sales. Is that because of the fleet sales drop?
John Felice
Brent, this is John. I will go back to give a little history, because it’s been a consistent message and I will share some specifics again. I know I talked about Escape and why that’s now, but earlier this year or part of the plan for this year was a conscious decision to pull back on our rental sales to be very managed. There is a lot of goodness in that plan in terms of improving our residual values. So that’s always been part of the plan. We have been tracking that way all year. And when you look at that in terms of the performance in this month, I know I mentioned Escape, while total sales were down 4%. Again, that was driven by a decline in rental. Retail were up 8%.
Looking specifically at Fusion, retail was up 11%. And again in Focus, while down 8%, fleet was down 61, retail was up 17. So again, it’s all part of our plan to manage in a very disciplined way our rental sales. It’s still part of the business. And overall, fleet has still been a very strong part of our business. As we mentioned on this call, it’s been a trend all year. Our performance in commercial and government sales which we have a dominant position continue to show strength this year. So, the only real strategic change in fleet has been a conscious decision in managing our rental sales at a lower level.
Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press
Okay. But why are you doing that? You defended where you have been at for several years on all three categories of fleet sales. Why did you decide to cut the rental sales so much this year?
John Felice
Well, as I mentioned, it is part of our residual value strategy, but also we’ve seen a more competitive pricing environment rental. And importantly, as we look at a system that’s running near capacity, we have retail opportunity on products like Escape, and we are making the decision to serve retail customers versus rental business.
Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Erich Merkle
Thank you, Brad. Lacy, another caller, please.
Operator
And at this time, we have no media on the line.
Erich Merkle
Okay. Very good, Lacy. Well, thank you everyone for tuning in this month, and we look forward to talking to everyone again next month as we run through our October sales performance. Thank you again everyone and have a great day. Thank you, Lacy.
