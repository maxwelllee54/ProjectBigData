Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the GE’s Additive Manufacturing Investor Meeting. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today’s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matt Cribbins
Good morning and thanks for joining our investor call. Today I’m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our CFO, Jeff Bornstein; and GE Aviation President and CEO, David Joyce; Head of Global Research Vic Abate; GE Aviation’s CFO Shane Wright; and GE Aviation Additive Technology Leader, Greg Morris.
Earlier today, we posted a press release and presentation on our Investor website at www.ge.com/investor. As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
Now with that, I’ll turn it over to Jeff
Jeff Immelt
Thanks Matt, and good morning. We wanted to give investors some context for the high-tech acquisitions we announce today in additive manufacturing equipment and services, SLM based in Germany and Arcam based in Sweden. With the foundation of these investments combined with our substantial commitment in advanced manufacturing, we plan to enter the market for additive manufacturing equipment, materials, services software and production. In addition, we will expand our development of additive innovation across GE and in our installed base.
This move fits the GE business model and adds for our strategy to become the premier digital industrial company. We have an integrated core of strong industrial businesses, ones that build, power, move and cure the world. We leverage our enterprise strengths, value created by R&D, scale, a common global footprint, service technology, Predix, financing and culture. And we’re moving from strength-to-strength as we build positions in industrial analytics and now in additive manufacturing. These represent foundational capabilities for industrial companies in the future. Through our investments, we’re creating horizontal capabilities in vertical businesses; and by doing so, we’re driving productivity for GE, our customers and industrial world.
We view additive manufacturing as transformative technology to expand product design, flexibility and promote speed. It facilitates the manufacturing of highly valued parts. It can dramatically improve service delivery and asset management. Importantly, these tools are perfect match for GE capability and it gives us a lead in one of the fastest growing industrial markets of this era.
Let me go into a little more detail on our plan. We plan to launch an additive manufacturing business. We’ll offer our full line of products; we will fully leverage our existing ecosystem inside GE including product design and internal consumption. We’ll grow a strong service business including materials, design, software and production. Many of these capabilities already exist inside GE and all of our products will embed the capability of Predix and will be an important part of our Brilliant Factory initiative.
We expect the business to have about $300 million of revenue in 2017 and grow quickly to $1 billion by 2020. In addition, it should facilitate $3 billion to $5 billion of cost out inside GE over time. This investment is in line with the strategy of the Company. We have a valuable industrial Company with strong businesses and big ecosystems. We’ve created value to the enterprise at the GE store. We’re leading the digital transition of industry creating both horizontal capability in new businesses and our aim is to achieve substantial productivity for GE on our customers.
We remain on track for our financial framework in 2016 and the bridge to 2018. We plan to have these businesses report to Dave Joyce in Aviation. While this will [ph] expand the Company, David is our biggest practitioner. And I will now turn the presentation over to Dave and the team.
David Joyce
Thanks Jeff. We’ve been on a journey of discovery with additive technology for quite some time at GE and it accelerated significantly after we bought more Morris and RQM in 2012. Since then, we’ve become more convinced at the transformational opportunity that additive brings, based on our own proof points.
The left hand side of this chart is meant to give you a perspective on why additive. Today’s manufacturing processes are castings, forgings, weldings, brazing and subtractive machines. Additive creates products by building up features in complicated geometries from powder layer-by-layer. Additive changes the game, because it changes the paradigm between the cost of manufacturing and the complexity of design. Design is going to optimize for performance and productivity with new and better cost entitlements and faster cycles. We are using additive in a LEAP engine today and our assessment over the life of the LEAP production is that additive can yield a 25% to 30% additional reduction in product cost entitlement and a 25% reduction in life cycle costs and service.
In our Advanced Turboprop Engine, we’ve eliminated 845 parts in design incorporating additive. This represents an elimination of thousands of machining features and inspections and hundreds of quality plants and procurement contracts. As I stated, this productivity can be transformational. This next stage uses a turbine frame assembly in one of our jet engine development programs as an example of the enterprise productivity. Incorporating additive manufacturing, the frame assembly can be created in one design file produced by eight engineers, manufactured and inspected using one additive machine and will be repaired at one source with access to all designs and manufacturing information linked through Predix. Now, compare that to today’s conventional assembly managed through 40 despairing data systems, 300 individual parts designed by 60 engineers and manufactured at over 50 sources and in service span out to five sources for repair. We believe this turbine frame assembly story is a good proxy for the future of digital industrial manufacturing.
Now, let me turn it over to Greg Morris to talk about the industry. Greg joined the GE Aviation family in 2012 when we acquired these companies, Morris Technologies and RQM.
Greg Morris
Thank you, David. We see four primary industry drivers that create the value chain, machines; materials; production; and services. Primary among these is the maturation and advancement of the equipment capabilities. Current laser and electron beam technology is very capable, but in order to achieve mass adoption, we will need to take machine productivity and speed to a new level. For each step change in machine speed and size, the number of parts that become candidates for additive multiplies exponentially. We also believe there are number of opportunities to incorporate advanced sensing and monitoring capabilities into future machines that will result in unparalleled part consistency and quality.
We anticipate that the different processing modalities that these acquisitions provide in addition to the equipment advances that have been outlined will allow us to protect current machine margins while delivering superior quality and value to customers. Closely linked to the machines are the metal powders used in the process. With these two acquisitions and other partnerships, we will build on our direct material production capability. This combined with GE’s strong materials research and development history provides an opportunity for us to create next generation materials that are tailored specifically to the additive process. Material volumes will grow in lockstep with the number of machines fielded that in turn will drive material pricing down, creating a more competitive landscape and further allowing for the democratization of additive parts.
Given GE’s leadership position, both in the additive ecosystem as well as our deep materials domain knowledge, we will lead the development of industry standards critical to creating the foundation from which all practitioners can build on. Another area of significant synergy is our ability to move these technologies from the R&D and prototype oriented phase into the production environment.
Over the course of the past five years, our aviation and power businesses in particular have been applying their production knowhow and expertise to existing additive technologies, incorporating automation and inspection capabilities critical to successfully industrializing the processes. Automation and fully production capable machines enable the brilliant factory and brings part conversion productivity to a new level. Finally, a substantial opportunity exists around the services component of additive where we can leverage our application engineering knowledge and wrap this into our Predix digital platform. This will create value for our customers in a multitude of ways including the creation of a seamless digital thread and an opportunity for customers to shorten their production learning curves by acquiring the experience GE has gained from a ramping up of additive production internally. The industries where additive has the opportunity to bring substantial value are primarily segments we know well, thus allowing us to leverage our experience for maximum benefit of customers.
Back to you, David.
David Joyce
Thanks Greg. As we assess the market in additive, we see machines growing by 20% CAGR through the middle of the next decade, and services including materials and software growing to over $10 billion in seven years. The modalities associated with additive are developing fast, based on the speed and feature resolution of the application. We are starting the equipment business in two segments, the largest, laser powder bed through SLM. This technology uses laser melting to micro weld the powder layer-by-layer creating additive parts; the second company Arcam is in a very fast growing segment of electron beam melting to micro weld the powder and build parts; two very complementary technologies that have a variety of applications across multiple business segments. We of course will continue to apply our research and development to all modalities at our global research centers, by these two acquisitions give us a great start in this rapidly developing industry.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Vic.
Vic Abate
Thanks David. As we look at all the various additive technologies and think about the entire ecosystem, we see all roads lead to the machine, and at GE machine design is at the centre of what we do across the Company. Shown here are the key high-tech components for the SLM solutions platform as well as the Arcam machines. Central to their capabilities are technologies which include lasers, electron beams, scanning heads and controls. The ability to control the additive process coupled with the understanding of material science is at the core of these technologies. Each brings capabilities and allows us to trade for attributes like build speed and feature accuracy which are critical for the adoption of additive.
Down below is an illustrative example of how we think about additive machines. Similar to our healthcare business where we use high-tech components and advanced materials and software to look inside the human body, we see many parallels in the design and evolution of additive machines. The ability to build from particles sophisticated parts and the evolution of those platforms through upgrades and software is limitless.
Now, back to you, David.
David Joyce
Thanks Vic. As we assess the market for additive powders growing at more than 25% CAGR, metals represents approximately 12%, which by 2020 we estimate could be as high as one quarter of the additive powder industry. These material systems are very familiar to our GE industrial businesses and research centers. Six of our businesses are using powder today and we have currently almost 350 patents in this material space. We’re confident that we can accelerate material and alloy development and certifications of material properties all driving adoption across multiple industries. Arcam is a leading provider of premium titanium powder to the additive manufacturing customers.
So, now, let me turn it over to Vic again.
Vic Abate
Thanks David. This chart illustrates why we believe we’re in a great position to lead in additive technologies. Over the past few years, we’ve built a tremendous network of teams and sites who are advancing additive manufacturing for GE every day. As we’ve increased the use of additively produce parts across the Company, we’ve not only grown the number of people engaged, but we’ve also significantly enhanced the competencies necessary to be the additive leader. And we view the additive ecosystem from idea all the way through a certified part. We’ve rapidly built out the GE additive store starting with the depth of GE research in both Niskayuna and Germany where we have deep to my knowledge in areas such as material sciences, laser physics and controls. Our acquisition of Morris Technologies in Cincinnati, Ohio has been a catalyst for us in driving the adoption of additive parts, given their application engineering and design expertise in additive.
Earlier this year, we opened our GE Center for Additive Technology Advancement in Pittsburgh, which focuses on factory design, industrialization of additive technologies and scale. From the ability to design a broad range of components to fundamental research on additive processes and materials to industrialization of machines, factory designs and software, GE now touches all parts of the ecosystem in multiple modalities of additive manufacturing. This page illustrates the investments we’ve been making in advanced manufacturing since 2010, as well as our key focused areas for the future.
Across our global research centers and the GE businesses, we’ve invested $1.5 billion over the past seven years in advanced manufacturing technologies across the Company. These investments have put us in a unique position to identify, implement and scale new manufacturing technologies like additive. We believe, we have a very strong pipeline of additive technology investments that will change the game in areas like productivity, materials and digital. We can see a future with much faster, not 10% but 10X or 100X faster machines and 100X more materials for our designers to design win and with digital and entire new digital thread as enabled as this technology it’s all driven by software, not physical drawings.
These efforts will allow us to get more materials into the additive ecosystem, build bigger parts faster for the most economical solutions and optimize for properties and performance with the speed and accuracy currently not available in the industry. More industrialized machine platforms coupled with brilliant factory technologies will enable the adoption of these developments more rapidly and better differentiate GE and our customers. We see this opportunity transforming not only our new make parts but driving new and innovative service offerings as well.
As we look towards 2025, we see the growth of additive in GE driving the need for more than a 1,000 machines. This equates to a new additive machines being brought on line in GE every three days over the next decade. As the industry and applications evolve and change, having robust; reliable; state-of-the-art capability is very strategic for us. Aviation is leading the way, moving from components to whole engine platforms produced additively. Our power in oil and gas businesses are taking the lessons learned from Aviation and are identifying multiple parts whose performance can be enhanced with additive and sub-systems that can be simplified with additive manufacturing.
Business models will evolve with the distributed manufacturing that additive enables. The ability to repair components with new materials and features will drive value for our customers through our installed based. Our healthcare business is trailblazing new applications for very hard to manufacture materials such as tungsten and they’re developing direct right additive methods as a platform for electronics printing. The GE portfolio of designs, features, materials and additive processes is industry leading and pacing technology developments across the entire ecosystem.
Back to you, David.
David Joyce
Thanks Vic. So, here is the incremental value to GE, starting in the upper left corner, materials as a service. Commercializing our materials expertise, a foundational technology in the company, expanding our digital playbook and Predix as a service on the factory floor to include additive, applying additive to enable new cost entitlement. I have listed three here as an example from Aviation of the current impact of additive, and we’re just getting started. New products and services that exploit the new cost entitlements creating new markets, we’re currently working in aviation on a new product family of additive conformal heat exchangers that will revolutionize the weight and performance of this industry and aerospace, and as a practitioner of additive, turning the price into cost on almost a 1,000 machines that enable this advancement across the Company.
Here are the economics. We are buying both SLM and Arcam for approximately $1.4 billion. We expect together we’ll achieve 40% CAGR over 10 years. Our internal use case will include 1,000 machines over the same time period to enable cost savings across the businesses of $3 billion to $5 billion. In GE Aviation alone, we have a line of sight to $3 billion of that savings. We intend to connect these businesses into the GE store investing R&D on machines, materials and software technology development. Standalone, on an external basis, together these yields return greater than 20% before we consider the additional savings of $3 billion to $5 billion in product costs across the Company. Margin rates become accretive to GE by 2021 and there is no impact to previous guidance of $2 a share in 2018.
So, let me turn it back over to you, Jeff.
Jeff Immelt
Thanks Dave. In closing, we are creating an additive manufacturing business because it fits our model and will create investor value. GE competes well in businesses that leverage systems integration and material sciences that create a valuable installed base and where productivity is driven through digitization. Here the GE Store contributes massively in materials and the global research center, Predix, internal consumption, globalization and financing. This allows us to lead in the next generation of productivity along with industrial analytics and it bolsters our long-term goal of 5% organic growth with margin expansion.
To recap, we plan to enter the market for additive manufacturing equipment sales, material, service and production. We will serve the entire market including internal demands and we believe that this is transformative technology which expands product design and service productivity. It’s a perfect fit for the GE Store and a great return for investors and we plan to lead.
Matt now back over to you for some questions.
Matt Cribbins
Thanks Jeff. I will now ask the operator to open the lines up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
Andrew Kaplowitz
So, you talked about the roadmap to go from about $300 million in revenue in 2017 for additive manufacturing to about $1 billion by 2020, I think for a high level of growth and you gave us different methods to get there. Can you give us a little more color on how you get there and where the growth is coming from?
Jeff Bornstein
Let me ditch this one over to Dave and his team. David?
David Joyce
Yes. So, if you take a look at where the market is, in fact it shows the total growth in the market in the presentation material on page seven. We see this market and we’re not alone, I would say that all the analysts that really follow additive, see this on the precipitous of a big trajectory. And I can tell you just from our use case within the aerospace business, we couldn’t agree more. As I said, just think about us going to a 1,000 machines over the next 10 years, and we’ll probably represent 5% of what we think the growth is in the entire -- in this business over that same time period. So, if you look at automotive, if you look at medical, if you look at all the other segments in the industrials, it’s easily going to allow us to get to the $1 billion mark in the timeframe that we said we could.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Okay. That’s helpful, Dave. And if you look at your 2018 goals, you said there is no change based on these investments but if we look at the ability to expand margins, you talked about 50 basis points a year in gross margin, 15% segment margin, you’re taking $3 to $5 billion of cost out over time, does that help you in getting to these near-term goals; how should we think about the near-term goals in the context of these investments?
Jeff Bornstein
Yes. I think the $3 to $5 billion of cost, our goal is obviously an enormous motivation for making this investment in this -- the set of technology. I think most of that value creation is going to happen outside of the 2018 window. We’ll have use cases and we’ll have experiments that we’re doing and applying the technology that will demonstrate the cost savings. But I think most of that value creation is going to happen after 2018. We committed the 50 basis points of margin improvement on average year-to-year for the foreseeable future. We made that commitment on an organic basis, so no change to that direction whatsoever. When you get to the outer years here at ‘19 and ‘20 and beyond, we think this will be a huge contributor to how we think about gross margin improvement at lower product and service cost.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Thanks guys.
Jeff Bornstein
Dave, anything to add on that question?
David Joyce
No, Jeff, as I said during discussion, we at GE Aviation have done a pretty detailed inventory, just based on three engine lines, GEnx, LEAP, and the GE9X, which will hit service in 2020. And we have line of sight quite frankly through the existing installed base service as well as the new products, the $3 billion of that -- $3 to $5 billion that we quoted inside this presentation.
Jeff Immelt
Two things, Andrew. We’ll have parts and production across the other GE businesses by ‘18. So, you’re going to see benefits in their margin rates as well. One other contextual point I think might be helpful, by 2020 and the $1 billion, roughly 40% of the revenue will be services. So, not only are we going to be expanding the product build-out but there is a very exceptional service stream that goes with this.
Operator
The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Julian Mitchell
I just wanted to ask a question around the $1 billion revenue target and what you are assuming there for any dissynergies from sort of competitors who are currently customers of Arcam and SLM walking away. I think if you look at Arcam for example, Honeywell even presented at their Analyst Day just a few months ago SLM supplies to Zeemans. [Ph] So, what sort of dissynergy have you factored into your sort of 40% revenue CAGR target?
Jeff Immelt
Dave, why don’t you start now; I’ll tell fill in as well.
David Joyce
Yes. So, look, I think it’s important that we put this in the right perspective. This is a big digital industrial play for the Company beyond simply the aerospace segment. It incorporates an opportunity for us to sell machines across many segments automotive, medical, aerospace, industrial, electronics. This is a bigger play than just aerospace. Relative to competitors in this space, like in aerospace, we do a lot of business with each other. I mean, I do business with United Technologies on a regular basis whether it Goodrich or whether it be Hamilton Sundstrand, they do business with us whether it be through Avio Aero or one of our other -- or Unison, which is another division. So, I don’t see any displacement as being part of this story on a broader scale of this as a pure digital industrial play beyond the aerospace industry.
Jeff Immelt
I would just add Julian, I think we have experienced, not just in aviation but across the Company where over time, we have products because they’re so competitive, we sell to some of our customers. And I would say the backdrop to all this is equipment market anyhow that’s growing in excess of 20% to 30% a year, so there is a ton of opportunity out there.
Julian Mitchell
Great, thanks. And then, just on the operating margin target of about 20% in five or six years’ time, I think that’s much higher than most additive manufacturing pure plays are doing in the industry right now. So, I wondered what you felt was different about GE’s offering as you go into this industry, particularly in the context of other industries like energy connections where you went in and obviously the margin performance there has not been of the level of the incumbent main players?
Jeff Immelt
Well, I think Jeff answered to question when he gave answer. [Ph] We think 60% of revenue profile here is the machine from sales and we think we’re going to have a very compelling technology over time that’s going to be highly differentiated. But there is a 40% services component of this including materials and powders that we think is going to be very lucrative. So there is no reason for us to think this between services and equipment is going to look materially different than the other GE business on a going forward basis, where we’re well in excess of 20% margin as we build services and equipment.
Jeff Bornstein
Yes. Jeff and I’ll just follow up. Look, there is an opportunity here for a more sophisticated playbook in services in this industry that fits more into our equipment businesses that you’re use to see, whether it be in aviation or healthcare. So, think of a service business that not only upgrades contracts on the equipment, but provides advanced software for design and manufacturing, provides application engineering skills, which could be CAD all the away to the additive parts themselves and think of contract manufacturing using additive as a service, as part of the businesses that will explore and think of materials application consultation as another piece of the services model here, so that we can really certify material systems to help accelerate the adoption of this and every one of the industry segments. So that’s kind of a model as we see it build out.
Jeff Immelt
I would add, Julian, again, I’d just think eventually companies here are going to get a escape velocity in terms of scale. We want to be one of those companies that does that. And just from a pure product costs when you decompose some of the products, it looks a lot like some of the healthcare products we make. So, I think from a systems integration standpoint, we have a chance to design technical low-cost products that we think we can take to market and be quite competitive as we do so.
Operator
The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie
So, maybe my first question, I’ve always thought of additive manufacturing for you guys as being more of a product cost story. Clearly this seems to be a transition. So, I want to hear some thoughts around the evolution. How long have you guys been thinking about going into the revenue component of this industry? And then also, if you could may be touch on the investment that you need to make to help commercialize these two acquisitions?
Jeff Immelt
So again, maybe I will start Joe and then hand it over to David again. We’ve been practitioners for a number of years both at the research center aviation and other businesses. I think as we study the technologies and learn more about the products and experience them ourselves, we saw the industry evolving in a similar fashion to other GE industrial businesses, systems integration, installed base service. And when we looked at our patent portfolio and technical foundation on both materials and equipment, it was may be the most robust of anybody in the industry. So, it’s a like business with similar customers where we’ve seen technical advantage in an industry that we felt was going to grow at multiples of the industrial world. That to me is entry point in terms of how I think about the growth of the Company.
And then, I think we had the opportunity to enter two modalities. We’ve got another three underway at the global research center. So, we’ve got the chance to be a full line player in a relatively short period of time. I think we felt like we could build a nice competitive position in the industry. So, let me give -- let me turn it to David just in terms of any other color.
David Joyce
Yes, thanks Jeff. So, I would say our journey on additive started back in the early 2000s, to be very frank about it. We hit the accelerator button when we went ahead and procured Greg’s companies, RQM and Morris Technologies. Greg had been on the cutting edge of applying additive in a more industrial setting than simply a prototype setting and was specifically looking at metals. As a result of our work with Greg, we became very excited about the opportunities in aviation to the point where we actually industrialize additive down in Auburn, Alabama for our fuel nozzles for the LEAP engine, which is our latest narrow body engine that’s in service now on the Airbus Neo and getting ready to go on service for the 737 MAX. So, we have experience in it. We then extended that experience to our Advanced Turboprop at our 9X. And the more we learned about it, the more we liked it, and the more quite frankly transformational this is for the designers and for everything, I mean for the whole supply chain, this is a very transformational technology moving forward.
Jeff Immelt
So, Dave let me just intersect with something that I think might be getting confused a little bit as the -- we’re really talking about the metals segment primarily here guys and that’s a very different segment than the plastics technology.
David Joyce
Exactly. So, no, that’s exactly right. And so, for us, we -- not only do we want to be on the cutting edge as a practitioner across the Company for exactly what you said, not only cost down, but also innovation and design, we look at this as a clear equipment business that we’d like to participate in as well.
Joe Ritchie
That’s helpful. May be one follow-up for you David. You mentioned that on the $3 billion to $5 billion in cost that you have line of sight on $3 billion within aviation, can you may be just tell us little bit more specifically what you’re targeting within aviation and beyond to get to the 3 to 5?
David Joyce
Yes. So, I would say, we’re looking at the installed base and then we take a look at the opportunity to bring additive into the services portfolio for an installed base. So, think about us having 46,000 installed engines in the commercial world by 2020 and the ability for us to look at the additive technologies as it impacts repairs in that entire installed base and what that does for the services portfolio. So that’s one piece of this. And then think about the new products that we have coming to market, the LEAP engine, the advanced turbo prop, the advanced helicopter engine, the ITEP engine that we’re working on with the army right now as well as the GE9X, all of which have a ripe quite frankly for opportunities and also adds upgrades for our existing products. So think of the GEnx engine and an upgrade strategy with that that allows us to take cost out and put more performance in the engine using additive. So, additive is not just about cost out; it’s about changing, if you will, the quite frankly the frame around the canvas as the designers work on. They are designing differently, more effectively and more efficiently using additive than without it which is one of the reasons that we’re so excited about this technology.
Jeff Immelt
I think just a big picture, thinking across GE, our ability to have more content of all of our products is just going to grow immensely through this innovation and this technology. And I think beyond that we’ll have capability that we can share with our customers and more broadly with customers in the industrial space, both in additive manufacturing, similarly to what we plan to do on additional and analytical side. So again, I think this just creates a more valuable GE for investors.
Operator
The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray
On just the roadmap for the parts conversion on the aviation side, I’d be curious to hear what your experience has been on FAA approvals of these products. Are there any unique challenges; if you’ve got high volume in these products getting redesigned for additive manufacturing; is the FAA geared up for these approvals?
David Joyce
Yes, terrific question. Deane, we’ve been working with the FAA; we’ve had them in to the aviation business in Cincinnati. They’ve worked lockstep with us to make sure that everything we’re doing we can verify the certification. And we will meet the same standards we do with any other part, whether it’s forged or welded or machine substractively or additively. It will go through the same level of testing, the same level of quality assurance and the same level of FAA regulations. I don’t know, Greg, I know you’ve worked with the FAA directly, why don’t I turn this over for you to give a little color.
Greg Morris
Yes, sure. Deane, it’s a great question. And I would argue it’s not just the FAA, it’s other bodies, government bodies such as the FDA in the medical arena, these are all institutions that clearly have concerns about a new technology but we’ve worked for a number of years with the FAA. And I know the same thing has been happening on the FDA side of the equation. So, we’ve informed them very carefully and we’ve walked them through the processes and I think we have a very strong level of comfort from these different bodies.
Deane Dray
That’s good to hear. And then there has been a couple of reference on this call about this being a great start to assets, gives you two modalities, you’ve got some modalities in your R&D center today. Are there more assets that you have your eye on, how do you build out this platform, do you need more resources and let’s say CAD/CAM [ph] but just what’s the build out from here?
Jeff Immelt
Deane, I’d think about this primarily as an organic play. In other words, we’ve been working in the space as David said and as Vic said for a number of years. So, we have a backlog of technologies that I think we think we can commercialize. Similarly on the martial side, I think, if you think about the global research center, a deep pool of material technology and capability going forward. And then I would say these two companies bring, in addition to just equipment a number of ideas in terms of what we can do in the future.
So, the way I would think about this from an investor standpoint is that we’re sitting on a lot of capability already that these will just help us put a finer point on. But the last thing, I’d say Deane is look, we’re committed to lead in this business the similar we do in aviation or healthcare or other businesses. And so, we look forward to growing and building capability, I think Dave in terms of the investment we’re going to putting for the business organically.
David Joyce
Yes. $1 billion over 10 years is a round number is the way to think about it, Jeff, of additional investment. But, I think that we’ve got more than enough assets. The key here for us in the near-term is going to be plugging these two really good anchor modalities into an incredible research and development and application set of a stack quite frankly that we’ve been working in our own Company. The other way to think about this is we are always going to able on the cutting edge -- practitioner of this technology. And the question is as we develop that IP is, are we going to keep it and commercialize it through this business as it can go elsewhere. So, for us, this was -- it just makes all kinds of sense, because we are going to commit ourselves to be on a leading edge of this technology in each one of the business, because of the value of it.

[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin
Hi guys. It’s actually Andrew, Obin.
Jeff Immelt
Andrew.
Andrew Obin
Hi. How are you guys?
Jeff Immelt
Good. How are you doing?
Andrew Obin
Just a follow-up to Deane’s question on certification of 3D parts. Where are you on nozzle certifications, those actually certified with FAA because I’ve heard of some delays?
Jeff Immelt
No, we’re flying them right now. If you go to Istanbul and take a Pegasus airplane, you have the nozzles underneath their wing. They’re flying right now and revenue service on the A320neo, the agent certified on the 737 MAX and we’re going through the aircraft certification process with Boeing as speak. So that’s done.
Andrew Obin
Okay. And just a follow-up specifically on aviation about more opportunities for vertical integration, and I’m thinking areas like nickel on or coatings. How should we think about those assets longer term; would you like to bring them end or do you think partnership is the right way to go forward?
David Joyce
Well, I think coatings is a big broad subject. There is just -- if you look at all of the opportunities. I think we have a good strategy right now with the way we’re doing our coatings with Praxair and Turbocoating being are two joint ventures as we speak now. That’s been really the right strategy for us, because it utilizes their expertise in building out those quick -- that equipment. At the same time, we get to use our expertise and technology and materials on both of those coating systems. In the future, it really depends on the coating system and how we do it.
You’re though, we want to look, wherever we have a big, if you will, intellectual capital invested in something like a coating or something like ceramic matrix composites or additive or titanium aluminide. This make versus buy dialogue has got to be front and center, it’s as strategic as the design and the parts going forward, especially with additive, it’s just another example of that same dialogue that has to occur in the business.
Jeff Immelt
I would add to David’s point, if you think about healthcare, we’re sole source on collimators, power’s got ample opportunities as does oil and gas. So, I think this ability to open up our own let’s say content is going to be massively important. And then, I would just echo, Andrew, what David said is designers and practitioners, I think we’re going to be immensely valuable to the customers of this equipment going forward because we just have massive amount of experience in how 3D design metal parts get done.

The next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley
Nigel Coe
Thanks. Good morning and congratulations.
Jeff Immelt
Hi Nigel.
Nigel Coe
Hi, good morning. It seems to me that -- you mentioned that 40% of the out year revenues in service and clearly the sales opportunity with additive manufacturing is huge, but just thinking about IP protection in this kind of world where you have one digital file, how do you think about protecting IP on very high margins that has?
David Joyce
Nigel, I think of it -- quite frankly, I don’t think of it a lot differently than I do today and maybe I should but I don’t. I think that as we get more sophisticated in designing these parts, I mean literally the internal passage ways of these parts are extraordinarily complicated in terms of the design, and that complexity does not come with incremental costs. That’s the beauty of additives. So, I can give you an example. We have a turbine frame liner in one of our engines that we are working on right now. The turbine frame liner -- and you won’t believe these numbers. This turbine frame liner literally holds the flame inside the combustion process. So, it’s a very, very volatile hot environment. We drilled 2,600 laser drilled holes inside this combustor liner to make it work and the holes are uniquely shaped and the dimensions are not just little holes, they literally are elliptical on that be quality checked et cetera. With additive, we have -- make it in one piece. We have reduced the costs with a one piece by 35%. We have improved its capability because we can design the holes with additive in ways that we can’t manufacture traditionally so that the liner itself runs 400 degrees cooler and lasts 5X longer in service with that 35% cost reduction.
Now that’s an example of the reality of what additive can do when the designers look at literally changing their concept of geometries, versus what they have been limited to in traditional manufacturing work. And if -- in terms of IP protection, that design of that one frame is so sophisticated and requires so much knowledge as to how to get it done, I don’t see it being any different than the -- or the combustor liners than the combustor liner we have today.
Jeff Immelt
A couple other, Nigel, contextual points, I would say we’re pretty experienced in terms of how to do materials patents at the global research center. That’s been I’d say a core strength for a long time. If you think about the equipment itself, I can only -- because we’re going to learn this kind of as we go, but a new CT scanner might be launched with 10 or 15 patents associated with it. So, I think we’ll be good on the equipment side, knowing what the art is. And then, the last thing I would say we’re hoping to make this similar part of Predix. And so, I think there will be opportunities to monetize knowledge as we look at brilliant factory in Predix on the manufacturing floors going forward.

The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.
Gautam Khanna
So, on slide 13, you quantified the incremental savings these deals give you on the LEAP 9X and GEnx. I just wanted to understand first the split, I mean does this relate entirely to the OE production costs or does it include some assumption on the aftermarket, and if so, what is that split? And then what is the timing of achieving those targets? And maybe David, if you can talk about some specific parts besides the one you mentioned for the combustion chamber that are made with castings now that you think these specific deals will help replace with additive?
David Joyce
Yes. So, these are all original equipment numbers that I put on page 13. They don’t include the services side of the business. And I want to be clear that this is a snapshot in time right now. In other words, when a designers go back and do an inventory on LEAP or 9x or nx, and we ask ourselves where we can redesign components in the case of nx at an upgrade timing at first shop visit, which -- or at OE you know when we put the upgrade in or where we can design 9x to take full advantage of additive, these are where the numbers lie. So, think of the shrouds in the turbine, think of the nozzles in the combustor, think of a combustor liner itself. Anywhere where today we’ve got very sophisticated geometries that require a number of parts that are brazed and welded together, that’s the way to think about the savings here is we can take very complicated assemblies that have complicated manufacturing processes and we can really reimagine them with additive in a way that eliminates literally thousands of dimensional inspections, yields go up, products -- the performance improves and costs come down. And most of that is in the most sophisticated areas. So turbine frames, combustor liners, turbine shrouds, low pressure turbine blades, all of which are good candidates for this additive technology as we look at it.
Jeff Immelt
Dave, when does the Advanced Turboprop enter into service?
David Joyce
‘18…
Jeff Immelt
So, that’s probably the best example of a new product let’s say that’s being designed fully with additive in mind. So, you’re going to see substantial cost reduction as we’re launching and like that.
David Joyce
845 parts have been eliminated in that design because of the capability of additives.

The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague
So, just kind of looking about this little bit of back to the question of make versus buy, there is also I guess an element here of vertical integration. There is a very important external story you talked about, but this at least rhymes a little bit with Avio if I think about vertical integration. Could you speak to that question more broadly; do you as the Company moving towards a more vertically-integrated model over time? And then the second part of the question really is just back to the make versus buy. Given the amount of investment you have made in this area over the last 10 years or so, was there some particular technical hurdle that you couldn’t get over organically that drove you to do these deals or is it just kind of a timeline/acceleration strategy?
Jeff Immelt
Couple of questions in there, Jeff. Why don’t I maybe start and then -- I would say that -- and basically all the businesses that we’re in, content matters. We’re always going to need suppliers, but in places where we think we have a very specific expertise and competitive advantage, those are places that as time goes on, we think about making versus buying. In this particular case, I would say Jeff, we saw a great chance for a vertical business as we went through it and we’ve spent a lot of time looking at this and assessing it.
So, in addition to just purely thinking about backward integration, we saw a way in many ways to create a very good market space for us going forward with a lot of competitive advantage, because the work Vic and his team have done over time. Avio, of course we’ve got a pretty good experience with that. And then, I would say that speed to market and doing these two acquisitions, I think gave us platforms and teams that we thought would be extremely valuable going forward that we can add to. So, I think this is a way Jeff to give us some acceleration and expertise in a way that basically -- I think is an investor friendly way that will accelerate our efforts and that’s I think how we looked at these acquisitions. I know guys, if you’d add to that or…
David Joyce
Yes. Jeff, I’ve just a couple of thoughts there. The use cases that we were saying were outpacing the pace of the industry. So, when you actually look at a lot of the equipments that we were buying, industrialization of that, the modification, we were pushing research at a fast pace to keep up with the use cases. And so, these acquisitions really put us in a position to take all roads sort of lead through machine, as far as the implementation and the adoption. So, we’re able to take very fast-changing derivatives of fundamental technologies, get them into an industrialized package and then implement them where we can use them across the Company scale faster.
Jeff Immelt
Jeff, I’d just like to say relative to Arcam and SLM, we look really carefully at the landscape of all the available companies in order to accelerate it. And we determine on multiple fronts that these two had very complementary technologies that fit very well on our profile, and we had experience with both of them, working Arcam in Italy on low pressure turbine blades and titanium aluminide as we speak on the 9X, which was -- it has been and continues to be a very positive experience. And SLM, we’re doing some very advanced research for their machines, because the open architecture which they design. So, in both cases, it’s not buy, it’s a very determined decision that we want to go after SLM Arcam. And my hats off to those two teams. I mean their leadership’s terrific and teams have done a great job of establishing themselves and technologies and marketplace, so a company like us can advance it even faster.
David Joyce
But I would just, for investors, I would say, look, we do this -- we have a pipeline of ideas that are going to go. I think this allows us to accelerate behind this, we’ve got bunch of other ideas in terms of how to accelerate, how to lead, how to build good customer presence and things like that.

Our final question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa
In the last 10-Q, you guys had a little bit of an updated disclosure around the FASB ASU 2014-9 and you referenced specifically the changes and kind of the accounting for aircraft engines. And I’m just curious, if that applies to services or OE? And if that is the case on the OE front, is this kind of one of the ways of getting to that cost level you need in kind of context of that change in accounting? It seems like it would be relatively significant for aircraft engines that you’ve called out in your filings?
Jeff Bornstein
Steve, are you referring to -- we did expand the disclosure on contract assets, but are you referring to the new revenue recognition spend comment?
Steve Tusa
Yes, ASU 2014-09, you talked about aircraft engine specifically. And so, I’m just curious as to do you -- is there different accounting you are using that impacts the OE side and therefore this kind of helps you get out in front of that or from a cost perspective?
Jeff Bornstein
No. Steve, we’ve not implemented the new standard yet; we likely won’t implement it. It’s not required to be implemented through 2018. It’s not just -- the standard doesn’t just impact aircraft engine, it will impact all of our business to varying degrees. We are in the very early stages of going through what that might look like et cetera. So, I think we are way early on being able to describe to you what it means or -- and it’s an accounting change, it’s not -- it doesn’t change economics of what we do.
Jeff Immelt
Look, I think this is really all about growth and competitiveness and building new business. So, I think that’s the context for what we’re now seeing today.
Matt Cribbins
Okay, thank you. Just couple of quick announcements before we end. The replay of today’s call will be available this afternoon on our investor website. And we’ll be having our third quarter earnings call on Friday, October 21st. Thank you everybody for joining.
