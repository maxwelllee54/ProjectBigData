HTC 4Q Profit Falls 91% as Brand Falls Behind in Smartphone Wars
HTC's losing streak continued on Monday as its fourth-quarter profit fell 91% thanks to poor sales in the U.S. market.
The company posted a 4Q net profit of $34.4 million, its lowest since 2004, but still beating analysts' predictions of a $23 million net profit. 
HTC's third-quarter profit had also fallen 79%; this is the company's fifth consecutive quarter with lower profits. The company is suffering a reverse in fortune that began in Q4 2011. Prior to that, HTC had several quarters of strong growth and record profits.
HTC's dwindling share of the smartphone market prompted the shortfall. The company's global share for the devices was 4% in the third quarter of 2012 vs. 10.3% for the comparable period in 2011, according to IDC. Competitors like Samsung (31.3%) and Apple (15%) stole HTC's market share.
Revenues for the quarter also fell 41% to $2 billion vs. the year-ago period. 
HTC launched its Japan-only Butterfly smartphone in the fourth quarter. The model sports a 5-inch screen, which the company says will migrate to other models that are available in other countries. However, as Samsung and Nokia plan new smartphone launches in Q1, analysts predict a tough quarter. 
Still, Chief Executive Peter Chou told The WSJ that he has reasons to be optimistic: "The worst for HTC has probably passed," Chou said. "2013 won't be too bad."
