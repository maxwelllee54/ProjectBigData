Thank you. Up next we have Goldman Sachs' President and COO Gary Cohn. We've got a very full room here again this year, which isn't surprising to me. There's been a lot of interest in the stock. There is still a somewhat tough macro environment.
Obviously, that we're in right now. But also some new, interesting, strategic efforts including the recent acquisition of the GE deposits and also the upcoming expansion in consumer lending. So Gary has got some slides that he'll share with us and we'll move to the fireside chat format where CFO, Harvey Schwartz, is going to join us. Gary?
Gary Cohn
Thanks, Matt. Today I'd like to give a brief overview of the firm and each of our businesses. Then I'll drill down on the business seeing the most headwinds, Institutional Client Services. As I'll discuss, the current low growth and low rate environment has been challenging for some of our businesses, while it's benefited many of our other businesses.
Let's start with an overview of our two largely fee based businesses, Investment Banking and Investment Management. These businesses have grown over the past four years, increasing their contribution to firm wide revenues by 9 percentage points, reaching nearly 40% of revenues last year.
Turning to Investment Banking, we maintain a leading global M&A and equity underwriting franchise. Our goal in M&A is twofold: to provide our clients with best-in-class advice, and to maximize our share of the largest and most strategic transactions. Although market volatility reduced M&A activity earlier this year, a low growth and low rate environment remain supportive of M&A and should drive clients to transact.
Moving to Equity Underwriting. Capital markets have started to re-open a bit after a period of substantially lower activity. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for our equity underwriting franchise. If markets continue to be relatively stable we expect to see more client demand in equity capital markets.
Moving to debt underwriting, we have seen a notable improvement in our market share. For example, we now rank fifth in investment grade, up four spots since 2011. Our strong advisory franchise boosts our debt underwriting business and provides us with unique debt financing opportunities.
Shifting gears to Investment Management. Our franchise is unique because we are one of a few large global providers of a diverse set of products and services. Our holistic product offering ranges from asset and liability management for our private wealth clients to fund products across all asset classes to tailored advisory solutions.
We continue to expand our franchise and finish the first quarter with record assets under supervision of $1.3 trillion. Over the past three years we've had great success growing our assets under supervision. We have produced $150 billion in organic active net long-term inflows which is among the best performance in the industry.
Going forward, we expect to build our recent momentum by providing clients with comprehensive advice, thought leadership and innovative products that help meet their investing demand.
Next I'd like to talk about our Investing & Lending segment. I am not going to spend a lot of time here given that Harvey discussed in this segment in detail last November.
We report the I&L segment separately to provide you with more transparent disclosure, but we think I&L should not be viewed as a stand-alone business. Instead, it should be seen as a collection of activities that are synergistic with our other franchises helping us to expand our client relationships.
Our I&L results show our efforts to diversify our franchise. For example, we continue to grow our diversified lending portfolio to serve our private wealth and corporate clients in ways that are accretive to the firm.
At the end of the first quarter, we had almost $65 billion in loans, which represent an increase of more than two-fold since the end of 2012. We also continue to evolve our equity investing to meet the needs of our clients to generate attractive returns while complying with Volcker requirements.
On the lending side, we will continue to pursue opportunities that are accretive to the firm by leveraging our technology, our history of building businesses and our lack of legacy costs associated with brick-and-mortar businesses. With that high level overview, I'd like to dedicate the rest of my time to our market-making franchise.
This is important given the challenging environment we've seen recently and the significant change underway in the industry. I will discuss what we've been doing strategically to navigate the difficult operating environment.
First, we continue to be disciplined with our resources both from a capital and cost perspective. Second, we are focused on strengthening and growing our client franchise, particularly with asset managers and corporations.
Third, we have continued to invest in technology which will allow us to efficiently deliver the best products to our clients.
ICS is a core part of our client value proposition. The business provides significant synergies across all our other franchise - our other client franchises, most directly with our Investment Banking division.
Our market-making business is differentiated because we have a strong client franchise in both equities and FICC and are roughly equal in size. What's more, both FICC and equities benefit from significant business level diversification.
As a result, we can deliver the totality of our prospective and capabilities across various products and geographies to our clients. FICC is comprised of five business segments, each has made significant contributions to ICS revenues over the last five years. While our franchise is strong, the current low growth and low rate environment has negatively impacted our clients performance and our own opportunity set.
Most recently, we also faced challenges managing our inventory to facilitate client transactions. Within equities, we have a comprehensive product suite that is well balanced between our agency commission business and our client execution franchise. We also have a leading Securities Services business that has contributed roughly 10% of ICS net revenues over the past five years.
Within ICS, we serve a diverse array of clients globally. These include asset managers, hedge funds, banks and broker-dealers, corporate’s, pensions, government and central banks.
On this slide we show recent client trends. One overarching theme has been the shift in client preference to more plain vanilla products from structured transactions. That said, client activity in structured transactions has fluctuated over the last few years based on the market environment.
Another trend over the last five years has been the shifting composition of our client base. Global active managers have struggled to produce alpha and increase assets under management while passive products have grown.
Corporations have continued to need the help to mitigate the numerous risks they face in foreign exchange rates, commodities and equities. Hedge funds and alternative investors have faced weak performance and flat assets under management.
Our government and pension fund clients have been less active given the low global rate environment. Finally, activity in banks and broker-dealers have also been negatively affected, which shouldn't be surprising given the new regulatory constraints.
Going forward, we continue to concentrate on serving the needs of all of these clients. We have launched initiatives to further our historical strength with hedge funds and banks, as well as broker-dealers.
We are also focused on broadening our client base. We are leveraging our strong investment banking relationships to strengthen our position with corporate’s, and we have increased our dedicated sales coverage for asset managers.
Our efforts are gaining traction with a 12% increase in our active corporate and asset manager clients over the past five years and there is still more we can do from here.
While our core goal is to meet the needs of our clients, we are also focused on maximizing return to our shareholders. Since posting record ICS net revenues in 2009, there has been significant focus on both the size of our market making business and our market share.
However, it is important to remember that not all revenue drives good returns. To illustrate this point, let me walk you through the chart on this slide. We show the average firm return on equity on the X axis and the size of average market making revenues over the past five years on the Y axis.
The size of each bubble represents the proportion of the firm's revenue that comes from market-making. As you can see, the dollar size of market making revenue and the percent of firm wide revenue derived from market-making are not highly correlated to the firm's ability to generate strong returns.
So, while we could increase our market making revenue, it may not translate into better returns. Instead, we are focused on maximizing our returns, which I will discuss in the context of a decision-making framework we use to optimize all our businesses.
We think about research allocations and decision making through multiple lenses at both the business and transactional levels. We think about numerous factors such as potential returns both near term and long-term, the level of client engagement, reputational risk, operational requirements and financial risk.
Over time, this framework has driven significant change throughout the firm and has led us to exit certain businesses, while adapting and investing in others. While returns are important, there are other factors that we also consider in our assessment.
Our business decisions aren't binary and management's judgment is crucial. We look at every transaction in the context of our broader client relationships. Our goal is to build strong, enduring relationships over time. Additionally, operational and reputational risks are critical considerations when evaluating new business opportunity.
Lastly, on returns, Harvey has discussed our capital tools with you in the past. So I won't go into great detail here. Next let me walk through some recent examples to highlight how our decision-making framework has helped us to adapt our franchise.
Take prime brokerage, for example. New leverage rules significantly increased the cost of our balance sheet. We responded by engaging with our clients, ensuring they receive appropriate service, while also reducing low ROA assets. After adapting the business and given the exit of some competitors, we've picked up balances and market share.
We are also adjusting our credit and mortgages business to respond to changing market structure, reduce market liquidity and new regulatory requirements. As capital requirements have increased for these businesses, we have responded by reducing inventory which should help us to improve returns going forward.
As these examples show, we are modifying our business mix to optimize our revenues and returns. At the same time, we remain committed to maintaining our ability to serve our clients across a broad product offering.
Clearly the operating environment has been difficult, but we're adapting as a result. While we seem unique in our stated commitment to our clients across FICC and equities, that doesn't mean we're not extremely disciplined with our resources.
We have cut our balance sheet risk-weighted assets and expenses. Since the second quarter of 2013, our market making balance sheet is down 25%. Our FICC credit and market risk-weighted assets are down roughly 30% and we have excessively managed our expenses.
FICC headcount is now down 10% since the beginning of 2012 through the end of 2015. FICC compensation expense is down more than twice that rate over the same period of time.
We've also actively managed the mix of our employees over the last few years. While we continue to be disciplined about our resources, it is important to remember that FICC operating margins remain quite high and our business is positioned to provide significant operating leverage when the backdrop improves. It is also important to be balanced.
We haven't shied away from the tough decision, but we also haven't cut so deeply that we can't serve our clients. We have faced macroeconomic and other challenges and have actively adapted our franchise as a result. Nevertheless, we have seen long-term positives for our business.
First, client needs remain intact, which is the most important long-term driver of our business. Clients highly value our ability to provide liquidity, asset liability management, advice, intellectual capital and risk management solutions.
Second, global GDP continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than many would like, and so does the size of the capital markets. In fact, over the past 15 years, global GDP, global equity markets and the US bond market have doubled in size.
Third, we think competitor retrenchment provides a key opportunity for us to solidify and expand our client relationships. We are optimistic about our positioning in FICC as many competitors shift their strategies.
Competitors are picking and choosing the niche where they believe they can compete, but we are working to deliver the whole firm across a broad range of products and services. This creates opportunities to strengthen our position with our existing clients. Importantly, it also creates opportunities to build new client relationships.
While broker rankings and votes are an entrenched practice in our equities business, we are only now starting to get more client feedback in FICC. As a result, we are increasingly focused on the granularity of where we rank with our clients and the pathway to improving our impact with them.
While it's quite early, our strategy is starting to bear fruit. We observed a recent improvement in client engagement particularly in flow products in FICC. We believe the recent momentum in our franchise will lay the groundwork for our future success.
In addition to capitalizing on disruption in the competitive landscape, we continue to embrace technologically driven market disruption. As you know, there's been a tremendous rise in electronification in the financial markets over the last two decades. Equities was one of the first products to evolve with new regulations like Reg NMS and decimalization.
Electronic trading and cash equities was just emerging in the early 2000s. Now the market is predominantly electronic. We invest in technology in response to feedback from our clients and adapted early to the electronic market in equities.
While we've steadily invested in our electronic capabilities in equities over time, we are always looking to strengthen our product offering. We recently acquired Pantor, which is an enhanced electronic trading platform, so we can better serve our quantitative asset managers and index fund clients. We aim to provide these clients better execution and lower transaction costs. Pantor should start to benefit our franchise in the back half of this year.
While electronification has been unfolding in equities for some time, we have also seen an electronic evolution across certain FICC products with regulation helping to accelerate this shift.
In the future, we expect fewer voice trades and more automatic pricing and execution. This slide shows the growth in electronic volumes across a variety of products with higher growth rates in fixed income products where electronic trading continues to evolve and lower volume growth in more mature electronic markets.
Historically, we've adapted to these changes within each of our FICC businesses and manage separate electronic books across foreign exchange, commodities, credit and rates. Now we are consolidating our effort so we can more efficiently allocate our resources and better meet our client’s needs.
In conclusion, we've been managing our business aggressively in response to the difficult operating environment. Our goals are relatively straightforward, to serve our clients well by delivering the products and services they need across our broad franchise, to selectively grow our footprint, to continue to be disciplined about protecting our margins, and to deliver accretive returns to our shareholders. This is our strategy in our market-making business and it is the same strategy we employ for the firm as a whole.
With respect to the current challenging operating environment, there are a number of strategic options we can pursue to further improve our performance. We can invest in our current business. We can shrink parts of our business that are underperforming. We can adapt and change our business mix by capturing new growth opportunities. We are doing all of these.
We are simultaneously remaining committed to meeting the needs of our clients and delivering superior returns to our shareholders over the long-term.
With that, Matt, I am happy to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Matt O'Connor
Thank you very much, Gary. I guess to start off with a few follow-ups within ICS, you referenced it's been a challenging environment to manage the inventory. And maybe you can just talk more about how much of that is the difficult market environment with all the volatility that we saw in markets in 1Q?
And maybe is there is still a regulatory impact, or component of that, say related to Volcker, which is when we adopted or implemented, I guess, 3.5 quarters ago now?
Gary Cohn
Matt, I think as you know, we are very committed to our client franchise. So we always are going to put our client’s interests first. We're committed to our complete business mix across FICC, as well as equities. And we believe that being there for our clients, using our balance sheet, committing capitals when our clients need us to commit balance sheets is the right long-term strategy for us at Goldman Sachs and it's the right long-term way to build a client franchise.
We know that we'll go through tougher parts of the cycle and tougher parts of the environment; that's something we're acutely aware of. We also know that in certain parts of the cycle we'll have more volatility than less volatility.
We are as an industry all having to learn to adapt to the total cumulative effect of all of the different rules and regulations that are being put upon us as we learn to abide by all the new regulations that we live with.
Matt O'Connor
And I guess just specifically on Volcker, has enough time passed to see if there is an actual impact from the formal adoption July 1 last year? And then just related to that, my understanding is you submit a whole bunch of documents, they read it and they may or may not get back to you, is that how it works or what's that back and forth like?
Gary Cohn
Well, I mean, Harvey can go much more technical than I can, but yes, we are - as everyone else who is Volcker compliant, we are obligated to submit an enormous amount of trade data and information to our regulators.
We're in the process of seeing what that data will be used for and what the communication will be. We don't know what it will be in the future, but that's not unique to us, that's where the industry is as a whole.
As you know, this is only a few months - a few quarters in the making of applying the Volcker data.
Matt O'Connor
And then on the FICC side of things, you talked about the margins are still quite good. I think the investor concern out there is there might be good net income, but on a fully loaded capital base the returns can be under pressure.
So, maybe talk about where you are in the optimization process of FICC. You had a slide up there showing that you've made some progress taking out assets and capital exposure. But how far along are you in that optimization process?
Gary Cohn
So in that, we're in a client driven, client centric business. We're here to facilitate clients. We need to be there for our clients. We are constantly evaluating our business. I've sat here in front of you many times before and told you we've never, ever been optimally sized.
You're never big enough at the top, you're always too big at the bottom, you don't know when you're going to the middle, you don't know when you've hit the top, you don't know when you've hit the bottom.
So, it's our job as a management team, and Harvey and I and Lloyd, we spend a lot of time talking about this. What size do you want to be relative to where you think you're going to be, not just where you are today.
And if you're going to stay committed to all of your client facing businesses, how do you do that? And we're constantly evaluating that and we are always making incremental adjustments.
The other thing that we always know is, look, we don't know when these pendulums swing the other direction. No one puts on the light and says, hey, the market's about to change direction, client flows are about to change direction. Inflows are going to happen in the long only manager; outflows are happening here.
So, we're always trying to modulate and we're always trying to be attuned to what we think is going on and make sure we're in the best position we can possibly be in.
Matt O'Connor
And then I guess beyond, maybe I'll try Harvey on the capital question in a different way. But beyond the kind of strategic repositioning, are there still some assets or exposure that maybe isn't SLR compliant or just business that you wouldn't do now but it's still on the balance sheet, because when you put it on it seemed like it made sense? Is that…
Harvey Schwartz
So I think that if you wanted to really oversimplify it, you could break it down into two discrete categories, those things where you can make a very disciplined and I'll call it somewhat permanent judgment about the fact that, let's say, the capital rules don't allow you to be the business as efficiently as you possibly could.
And we've either sold those businesses, restructured those businesses or taken the necessary steps with those things like the reinsurance business and other things that you've seen us sell over the years.
The vast majority of where we spend our time now, because if we can make that decision, we've made it already, is really what Gary is highlighting, which is how do you size the business as you go through different cyclical factors and they can be very long cycles.
But, for example, if we were sitting here four or five years ago at the conference and we were talking about M&A, most people would've thought M&A was gone and maybe not coming back.
We certainly didn't pick apart our M&A franchise because we knew from the client feedback and the discussion with boards that that business was there; it was just going through a cyclical low. But these are the kinds of judgments that Gary was highlighting that we make all the time.
Matt O'Connor
And then switching to expenses, the expense management was very good in 1Q. The comp dollars came down quite a bit along with the revenues, which I think everybody viewed as very impressive and non-comp was also well managed.
Just talk a little bit about the expense philosophy of the company, something that you pride yourselves on in terms of being flexible, but maybe just elaborate on that. And there's always a question of how much more is there that you can do given you've already done so much?
Gary Cohn
You want it?
Harvey Schwartz
No, go ahead.
Gary Cohn
We both spend an enormous amount of time on it. So look, we're - again, we're always managing the expense side of our business. It's one of these disciplines that either you have the discipline to manage the expense side of your business or you don't or you've had to create it. And the good news for us is we've always had the discipline to manage the expense side of our business. We'll continue to manage both on the comp and the non-comp side.
We feel like it's our obligation as a management team to run the firm as efficiently as we can, understanding we have two constituencies. We have a shareholder base where our job is to optimize returns for our shareholders, but understand we've got a human capital base, our property, plant and equipment is our human capital. And we have to attract and retain the best human capital in the world to drive the organization to be able to facilitate our client’s needs.
In balancing those two constituencies, I think we've got a very good track record of being able to manage that. It's the same thing we're doing this year.
Matt O'Connor
There is been some media reports of additional cuts in the second quarter here. I don't know if there's anything that you want to comment there. I noticed the slides were as of yearend, but we obviously saw further progress in 1Q and a number of reports out there this quarter of some additional culling, anything you want to add on that?
Gary Cohn
We go through our normal culling exercise every year. So the beginning of every year, and you know this and everyone in the room probably knows it, we go through our normal exercises of taking out our bottom performers. And our view has always been if you take out your bottom performers and you replace them you're still going to be in a better place.
So we've always gone through our normal beginning of the year exercise which we're going through as well this year.
Matt O'Connor
And then one last question on FICC before we get to some of the other strategic efforts. I know in the past you haven't commented on intra quarter trends here, but any updates on how the markets business is trending so far this quarter after a pretty rough 1Q?
Gary Cohn
Well, we won't change that history of never commenting again. So you can say that again next year that we've never commented. Look, the fundamental factors that we have always said would be huge drivers for our business. We're all watching them just as you are.
We end up with US GDP at 0.8% in the first quarter, so we look at that. We've always said if there's been one thing we're most closely related to at Goldman Sachs it would be global GDP. Well, US is one of the brighter stars in global GDP. So GDP growth may be getting better in the second quarter.
Market volatility is a little bit less in the second quarter. So to the extent we had - we had really unprecedented movements in the equities market. It's been since the 1930s that we literally started the year, had an equity market down 10% end up unchanged. So we're not having that type of movement in the second quarter.
Client franchise is good, but our clients are doing less for a variety of different reasons. As I said in my presentation, some of our typical long only asset managers are having outflows, not inflows. Hedge fund performance has not been great, so they are trading less.
But we're always realistic that that can change tomorrow and performance can change tomorrow and you come out with a hot IPO or two and people started feeling like they've got tailwinds versus headwinds and the whole momentum can change very quickly.
So we're being very thoughtful about making sure we're there in front of our clients and making sure we're capturing as much market share as we can.
Matt O'Connor
And shifting gears to what I would just call, broadly speaking, the bank initiative. You alluded a number of times in your prepared remarks about business mix shift and we've already seen a lot in terms of the build out of Investment Management the last several years and the Investment Bank and combined the contributions increased quite a bit.
But talk a little bit more about what the ambition is on the bank side. And it feels like right now you've got the deposit side from GE plus some deposits you already had and then like a budding lending platform. What can you add on that, what do you see yourself potentially becoming?
Gary Cohn
So look, we look at the bank strategies and the asset side strategy. We're looking to lend money in the situations where we think on risk-adjusted rates of return are highly accretive to our shareholders. And that's the philosophy we've had and we've had it for lots of years and lots of different businesses and lots of different silos.
So, we'll always be looking at the asset side of the balance sheet and having the GE deposits, someday it will be the Goldman Sachs deposits. Right now the GE deposits, it's just another diversification of funding for a firm where we have a lot of different sources of funding.
Matt O'Connor
I guess thinking through it, though does it make sense to have a little bit more of a liability strategy as well to significantly increase the deposit base?
You don't have - as you mentioned before, you don't have some of the kind of legacy costs, whether it's from a regulatory point of view or infrastructure. We've seen some other firms raise quite a bit of deposits and it makes it easier to fund the asset side if you have low-cost cheap deposits?
Gary Cohn
Yes, and as you can see, we're exploring all opportunities. A year ago if we were sitting here we wouldn't have been talking about the GE deposits.
Matt O'Connor
And beyond this one acquisition, whether it's near term or just looking out longer term, how much interest, how opportunistic would you be for additional bank type deals, whether it's on the asset side or funding?
Gary Cohn
We'll tell you the same thing I've always told you and it will sound funny, but it's how we run the firm. We will look at any opportunity, if it makes sense for our shareholders, we will spend an enormous amount of time evaluating it.
Matt O'Connor
If the audience, if you have any questions, raise your hand and we'll get you a mic. Switching to banking while we get folks interested here to ask questions.
M&A very strong last year, obviously slower start this year. We've had the changes from inversion, the political uncertainty, the Brexit uncertainty, there is a lot of obstacles you could point to, but there is also some positives that low growth makes maybe people more interested in doing a deal. But how do you think this all sorts out and what your outlook on M&A medium-term here?
Gary Cohn
Look, we continue to be cautiously optimistic. I would say the optimistic, many of the factors or I would almost say all of the factors that were in place last year that drove almost a record year, continue to be in place now.
If you look at what drove the big M&A cycle last year, it was the cost synergistic merger where companies could merge themselves together and the rationale for the merger was to cut out expenses or duplicated costs and create accretive shareholder returns by delivering that duplicated expense to the shareholders.
We still think in this lower growth environment with very cheap financing and low rates available, that we'll continue to see more of that merger activity over this part of the cycle.
Matt O'Connor
And on the issuance side, you made a comment that, obviously, the market is stable on the equities side if it stays stable for longer you would expect ECM to pick up. I guess I've been surprised on the debt side, ex-energy, you know, Paula made the point before you today that ex-energy, high yield has gotten just quite expensive or very low yields.
But yet we haven't seen as much pick up in the high yield or some of the riskier debt side of things that maybe you normally do. Any thoughts on why that is? Is it just a matter of need more time?
Gary Cohn
You mean on the issuing side?
Matt O'Connor
Yes, sorry, on the…
Gary Cohn
Yes, I just - I think it's - you probably need more time and companies - many of the companies don't need you know, if they needed the funding, the markets are open for them to access the markets. So there is no issue of access to liquidity. It's just what do the companies need on their asset liability.
Matt O'Connor
And then, Harvey, on I&L, you've outlined before how much you actually need to divest; I think it's by the end of next year, although there might be a one year additional grant period if needed.
But just remind us of how much is private that you need to exit. And then I think the public piece, which is obviously more liquid, but most of that you see exit as well, if I recall correctly?
Harvey Schwartz
Yes, so the right way to think about the order flow is there's $7.5 billion in assets and $1 billion you should consider just exempted. That gives you $6.5 billion $2 billion is already public, which leaves you with $4.5 billion, would be the private number that you are looking for.
But as you said, the industry is seeking extensions which could be for as much as another five years. So we'll see how that evolves.
Matt O'Connor
And then obviously, the structure of investing directly is allowed under Volcker. You are essentially remixing the book from as I like to say just a fun structure to the direct structure. How is that going in terms of finding opportunities for new investments here?
Harvey Schwartz
So, I think the way to think about it is over multiple years, and it kind of gets back to your earlier question about capital and our ability to be flexible on capital because we don't budget capital out at the beginning of the year; it's much more of a marginal process. We can move capital around the firm with a fair degree of flexibility.
And so, as we talked about in the past, the I&L balance sheet has pretty significantly shifted over the past five years, and now for everybody it's $99 billion at the end of the first quarter of which about $21 billion is what we would call equity.
And so, the mix shifts over time. The fact that we have the flexibility to go into different asset opportunities has been, obviously, beneficial in terms of our ability to redeploy it in a way that Gary has described.
Matt O'Connor
Any questions? Up here in the front.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thank you. You talked a lot about cycles. Do you think the movement of active to passive or the movement of - to electronic market-making, is that a cycle - are those cycles or is that permanent?
Gary Cohn
I think there might be two different answers. I'm not sure the electronic is going, I think the electronic may be a permanent change.
Harvey Schwartz
More secular.
Gary Cohn
Yes, more secular. So I think the electronic trading is much more secular. Many of the products that go electronic probably stay electronic and there is no reason for them not to stay electronic.
The passive - the active to passive to me could be much more - much, much more cyclical. Because if we ended up in a world where you saw active managers outperforming index by many, many basis points, net of fees, you would clearly see a migration back into those active portfolio managers.
One of my part time jobs is I run a couple endowments, and we look at performance net of fees and we'll tend to go where the performance is. And it's not that the endowment committees say, look, we're only going to passive, we're going to go to where we think we get the best risk-adjusted returns net of fees for the longer period of time.
So, I do believe that that is much more cyclical. And you will see active management at some point potentially outperform index.
Matt O'Connor
On the - in the market-making aspect, is there an equilibrium between voice and electronic?
Gary Cohn
There is always going to be some equilibrium. I mean even in the equities market where Harvey and I have both lived through the migration from 0% electronic to 90% plus electronic, we still have a voice overlay component where there is certain transactions that don't work in the electronic system.
Whether they be large blocks, whether they be swaps, derivatives, certain type of transactions that don't work in the electronic system or the algorithmic system. So I do believe there will be an equilibrium between voice and digital.
Matt O'Connor
Gary, last year here you talked about a number of technology initiatives, and I think in short like some were aimed at reducing costs, some to field capital, but some also that you thought could be monetized, as you shared with peers or competitors or including with peers and competitors as well as clients.
Any update on that or is it too early from an outside point of view to maybe see some of those benefits?
Gary Cohn
We're continuing to head down the path to create platforms, whether they be Goldman Sachs platforms [ph] or industry consortium platforms, whether they be sole contributor, multi-contributor. We're going to do what's right for the industry, what's right for us to be able to control data, be able to control infrastructure.
The one change that continues to evolve which probably slows down many of these platforms is just the regulatory hurdles and data retention and data requirements. Those bars just continue to get higher and higher.
So if you thought your time to market was 6 to 12 months, it now might be 12 to 18 months to make sure you've got all of your encryption right and your data retention right and your regulatory approvals right.
But it's - I would say most of those platforms are still heading down the path that they were on.
