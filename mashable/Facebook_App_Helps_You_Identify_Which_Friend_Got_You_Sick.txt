Facebook App Helps You Identify Which Friend Got You Sick
Feeling queasy and in need of a scapegoat? A Facebook app from pharmaceutical company Help Remedies may be just the thing. 
The app scans for mentions of flu symptoms and other related terms in the status updates of your Facebook friends as well as "suspicious check-ins" (think hospitals and pharmacies), helping you identify who may have given you the flu or who is most likely to. 
The app is just for fun, but data from social networks including Facebook and Twitter has proven valuable to researchers tracking the geographical spread of viruses like H1N1.
