Sony Stops Manufacturing PlayStation 2
Sony launched its most successful console so far, PlayStation 2, in March 2000, selling more than 150 million units in nearly thirteen years of its existence. Now, having recently stopped selling PS2 in Japan, Sony has confirmed to the Guardian it will stop manufacturing the console altogether. 
More than 1.5 billion games have been sold for PlayStation 2, and new games are still being developed for the console. 
The console's successor, PlayStation 3, has been on the market since 2006, but only 70 million units have been sold to date. Sony is widely expected to launch a new version of PlayStation sometime in 2013.
