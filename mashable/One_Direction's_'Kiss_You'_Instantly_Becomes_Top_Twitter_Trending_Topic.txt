One Direction's 'Kiss You' Instantly Becomes Top Twitter Trending Topic

Boy band One Direction, who won Most-Share Worthy Video at MTV's Video Music Awards for "What Makes You Beautiful," just unleashed a new music video to its legion of fans.
"Kiss You" arrived Monday after One Direction teased fans daily with a series of promo videos on YouTube. The buzz-building tactic — satisfying for some and annoying to others — has previously been employed by Matchbox 20, Britney Spears and other artists.
After its release, #KissYouOnVEVO became the top worldwide trending topic on Twitter.
