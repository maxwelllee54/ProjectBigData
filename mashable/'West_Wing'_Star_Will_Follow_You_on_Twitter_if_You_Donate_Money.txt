'West Wing' Star Will Follow You on Twitter if You Donate Money

Do you have any celebrity followers on Twitter? Would you like to get one?
West Wing alum and current Scandal star Joshua Malina will follow you on Twitter for a year if you'll donate $10 to Mazon, a Jewish hunger-fighting charity, in honor of his 47th birthday Jan. 17. 
"A minimal kick-in gets you a heartfelt thank-you and a year's worth of being followed by me on Twitter," he says. "At least once a week, I will check in to your feed, and laugh gently to myself at something you've posted. Promise!"
He made the video above for his campaign on Causes.com, showing some gifts for the highest bidders, including a Scandal backpack given to the show's cast and crew for the holidays and a vintage Sports Night mug he's been using for several years.

In his Causes campaign, he guarantees he doesn't wish to dissuade you from getting him "quality leather goods or gag socks" for his birthday as well. Malina also acknowledges that the goal he set of raising $1 billion for the non-profit is quite lofty. So far, he's raised $6,098.
