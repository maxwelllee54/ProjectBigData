Great. So very pleased to welcome to stage Mark Little, who leads GE’s R&D efforts and normally having a Head of R&D on stage would be a challenge. But we’re looking forward to this, this slot, because R&D is central to what GE does, and Mark brings a huge wealth of experience. He has been at GE for 36 years and before running R&D, he ran the power-gen business for GE, so a wealth of experience.
Mark is going to do presentation and then we have some Q&A. So with that said, Mark over to you.
Mark Little
Great. Nigel, thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Thanks for coming in. So 50,000 and more technologists across the Company supporting all the GE businesses, we spend over $5 billion on technology, and I will say a little bit about what we’re doing with all those resources.
This is a chart that I took from Jeff’s presentation. You may have seen this before, and it shows the amount of money we’re spending across the three-year period on technology. You will recall that it’s up substantially from previous years. We used to be running at about 2% to 3% of sales spending on technology, and now it’s in the zone of 5% to 6% and we stepped it up, we will probably stay at that level for the foreseeable future.
We are as the chart says, very broad and very deep. We are deep technically, we’re broad -- broad across the industries that we’re in, and we’re very much global. We win because we do the fundamentals right. The organization that I lead, GE Global Research, spans the globe as I will show in a second and it’s really very, very heavily connected with our GE businesses.
We do difficult things, but always with the aim of bringing value to our customers and to our shareholders. And part of my job is to make sure we spread technology rapidly and effectively around the Company. We do solve big complicated systems problems like we do in the aircraft engines, and I will show you about that in a minute. Our foundation is very, very strong.
We do the fundamentals right, and we do work with customers to understand their needs and to shape what we do around them, and across the Company we have product managers who understand their businesses, their customers, and help mold our research into effective products and services that make their way to the marketplace.
GE Global Research is the first industrial research center formed in the United States back in 1900. The founders of our Company believed then as we believe now, that innovation and technology are at the core of a great industrial company, so they influenced the young professional that come out of MIT to do this first industrial research. He wasn’t sure it was a great idea, but he fell on love with it. He came full time and he ran the place for 32 years. Since 1900, there have only been nine of us as people come, they don’t want to leave it. It’s a very exciting place to be.
We were the first found in the United States as an industrial research center. Many have come, many have gone. We are still standing and we’re stronger than ever. We’ve been expanding our global presence. We are in Upstate New York, about three hour drive up from New York City, and if you haven’t been, I hope you will come sometime. It is a fabulous place. We’ve been there since our founding, but we’ve been spreading out around the globe.
We went to India at the turn of the century. We started out there with a small group and now we have over 5,000 technologists supporting each and every one of our Company’s businesses. We then went to Shanghai, China with a team around 1,500, then to Munich Germany to get the core of the EUs, the hot research and great scientists. Then we came back to the United States to the Detroit area, in Michigan for advanced technologies around manufacturing. We went to Rio de Janeiro for a great customer connected center that we have just built out. It is a beautiful place and a beautiful location with great people. We have come back now to Oklahoma to set up the first center focused on one business, that's the oil and gas business, because we see ourselves very strongly committed for the long haul there. We’ve got a great leader. We are building our team there, and we’re continuing to build out -- oh sorry, I mentioned -- I didn’t mention San Ramon in California, just up the road here.
Three years ago, we had one person and as admin. Now we’ve got 1,000 exciting people driving technology across the Company. I will tell you more about that. We have smaller places in Israel, Russia, and Japan, and all of these together are aimed at bringing the world's best resources to bear on building out our Company.
GE Global Research is at the core of the Company’s technologists. We are designed to be a set of high-end technologists who are very deep, who can support as I mentioned all of the Company’s businesses.
As you can see from the pie chart, the majority of our funding comes from the GE businesses. There is no corporate mandate to spend money at the research center, but they do because they see great value coming out of our activities.
We like the model where they drive our agenda. It makes our scientists and technologists care about what the world needs. And as I mentioned, everything we do is formed to bringing great value to our customers and shareholders. We write a lot of papers; we get a lot of patents, but the measure of success is wining in the marketplace.
We do get some external funding from the U.S government and big companies who fund and co-fund work with us. And we do spend corporate money on ideas that are ahead of the risk appetite, our time horizons of our businesses, but in every case, it’s aimed at ultimately being connected with something that the businesses will bring to life.
Just a quick run through some key technologies, and I could spend all day telling you about what we’re doing, but I just want to give you some sample and some sense of what we’re after. This is a little marketing way of thinking about what we do. It’s what we call, the what’s next list. And the first thing is extreme machines. We build machines across our industries that do very difficult things, that run at pressures and temperatures and environments that are very difficult to operate in. We think this is where we can create real value, and to do that we don’t just use materials, we build super materials. Brand new materials that can do things that simply couldn’t be done before, and we’re building out the intelligent Internet, which uses the connections that are so prevalent everywhere now that brings real intelligence to our customers in their operations of our products and services. And we talk about mapped minds. Not only can we see the structure of our minds with CT and MR imaging, we can now see the function of our mind, and this will take us to a whole new place in neuroscience detection of disease and building out a whole new capabilities.
We are taking the same intelligent Internet kinds of approaches into our factories to build our great new capabilities and of course many of our businesses are built around the idea that we will extract and utilize energy in ever more effective ways.
So let’s start with Aviation. We are growing very strongly as you know and technology is certainly at the core of what they do. Two out of every three flights that you might take are powered by GE as partner’s engines. It’s a great franchise for us and at the core of it is a suite of technologies that are really leading the world. From advanced alloys to a high percentage computing for advanced aerodynamics to advanced manufacturing techniques, every advanced technology you could dream of is embodied in these advanced aircraft engines.
One of these is -- one of these embodiments is what we call LEAP that we do with our CSM -- CFM partnership. This is a wonderful new product. If you’re a techie as I’m, or if you like technology at all, you’ve got to love this engine. It’s got everything in it. We delivered this ahead of time. It’s achieved every performance metric that we wanted to. It’s very complicated; it’s got lots of parts and operates at extremely high temperatures and pressures. We do use advanced manufacturing techniques, many of them including 3D printing to make components for this engine, and the clearance is that you have to build this engine very, very, very tight, much smaller than the diameter of a human hair.
One good example of a core technology here is what we call ceramic matrix composites. Now, these are silicon carbide structures that have fibers and a matrix to give you the best of all worlds for high temperature capability and durability. The fibers are the diameter of a human hair and there are thousands of them in these structures. You can see from the chart that you can take these materials to much higher temperatures than you can take metals. That gives us an ability to drive better performance, basic thermodynamics tells you that you want high temperatures to get high efficiencies, and this gives you that capability. And they’ve the capability to be very strong, but very lightweight. So high temperature, lightweight, this is a dream for an aircraft engine, and these things together -- this set by themselves drives 1.5% fuel efficiency gain over the life of an engine, this is worth hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits to our customers.
On the gas turbine side, we’re very proud of the new H-technology line that we’ve got. This is a resurgent area for us. We are taking many of the technologies that I just talked to you about and plowing them in here. This is a machine set that is bigger than our competitors. It’s more efficient. It has operating flexibility that is first in the industry. We have an order book that’s building up rapidly. We’ve already announced the number of orders. Stay tuned, you will hear about more.
This technology comes again from the great synergies across the Company. The research center has been building technologies for these machines for years. Our aircraft engine provides technology and people frankly to enable these technologies to come to our gas turbine line. And the power and water business has built out a great platform that they will take into the leadership position in the marketplace.
I hope you’ve heard about FastWorks. This is a great new approach. Our Chairman talks about moving at the speed of the marketplace and we’ve really got something that I’m very, very excited about here. What is it? Here is a good example of what it is. Here is something we call solid oxide fuel cells. This is at its early stages, but we’re using all the ideas of FastWorks, which I will show you in a minute to get this going fast.
We set up a separate team. We took technology and technologists out of our corporate research center and our business, put them aside, let them run fast and free. The idea here is that we have a groundbreaking manufacturing technology that will allow us to build solid oxide fuel cells at very low cost, very high reliability, and when you put that together with the reciprocating engine and feed the fuel first to the fuel cell and then the residual through the reciprocating engine. You can get a distributed power system that’s 65% to 70% efficient.
Now contrast that to a large central station power plant like the H-machines I just showed you, that are working at 61%, 62%, maybe 63% efficient. So here we’re talking about localized distributed power at higher efficiencies at central power. This inverts the paradigm that it has existed forever in power generation. How do we get to these things? This is the idea of FastWorks. We got to this by engaging with Eric Ries and others from Silicon Valley who stimulated us to think differently about introducing technology, getting customer’s feedback fast, learning what they tell you, and pivoting to make your products better and faster.
This has really blown through our organization and it’s been adapted faster than any corporate initiatives that I’ve ever seen. The technology teams and product teams are very excited about it. We see it across every business. This spinout of solid oxide fuel cells from the research center, the HA gas turbine lines coming online two years faster than they would have otherwise. You will see in distributed power reciprocating engines coming out with the whole set of products to get customer feedback and learnings very fast. This is a tremendous new idea that its helping our custom -- our business get through our customers faster and produce products better and faster than we had ever dreamed, so very exciting.
Shifting over to oil & gas. We love the portfolio that we’re building. We’ve differentiated products on a set of platforms that we’re building out. You see us acquire businesses. We believe that we’re acquiring businesses that have technologies that either we don’t have or a platform that we can add the GE technologies that I’ve been talking to you about this morning. Here is a good example. This is the Shell Prelude. It’s the world’s first floating liquefied natural gas platform. It needs great new technologies. We are proud to say that our compressors will be on this first floating LNG. We do develop new flexible riser technologies to allow the platform to move some and take advantage of that new technology, and we’ve cryogenic valves that are first of a kind, all built into this new platform. A good example of GE solving complicated customer issues in a very reliable and efficient way.
Another example is the 20,000 psi blowout preventer. This is the first in the industry. It takes the best of GE technologies for reliability, durability, and frankly software and controls, I will tell you in a minute and puts it on the ocean floor to make sure that these things operate in very rugged environments, very reliably.
On the right hand side, we’re showing taking -- how we’re taking some things from across GE and bring them to bear here. The SeaONYX controls technology is based on what we call the Mark 6E platform. It’s a controls technology we’ve built out in our power and water business and are spreading around the company. So it’s finding its way in the oil & gas.
In the SeaLytics balance of -- blowout preventer advisor is the idea of taking software monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics, and putting it again to work in oil & gas system, reducing downtime and increasing availability.
Here’s transportation with the Tier 4 emissions requirement. So as you may know the Environmental Protection Agency here in the U.S required their suppliers drop their missions by over 70%, a daunting technical challenge. We’ve invested many millions of dollars to get this technology ready when our customers would need it. There were times in the past couple of years, our customers said hold on, we don’t need it so fast. We don’t think we will be ordering any low components in the near-term. You don’t have that ready so soon. Some of our competitors listened, we didn’t. We chose to continue to invest and now we’re ready and they’re ready. You’ve heard us announce a number of orders for Tier 4 emissions technologies already. Stay tuned, there is an Investor Call on Wednesday, you can listen on that. I advise you to hear what’s going on. We are in a great position. We’ve got a suit of technology, we demonstrated work. Customers want locomotives, we’re the only ones ready. It’s a great place to be.
In healthcare, we’ve a set of platforms across healthcare that I believe is really breathtaking. Here is only one example; this is what we call Revolution CT. It’s the latest technology in CAT scanning. And the idea here is that we’re going to after the cardiac embodiment of this. This is the most difficult thing to do in CT, because you’re trying to get an image of an organ that won’t sit still. So now with speed and a lot of great technologies, we’re able to get images that we just couldn’t get before. Now, you’re probably not cardiologist, but if you look at the image in the right hand side, anybody could see that there is something wrong with the flow there. So with this CAD scanning technology, we’re able to see that there is we call the prefusion issue with a heart, enable to see that in the way without the invasive of procedure required to get this kind of imaging other way. And we’re hopeful that with this great new technology we’re really minimized the number of invasion procedures. You have to go on, just diagnose serious issues. There is a lot of ground breaking technology in this new device.
In the other side of healthcare the Life Sciences business we’ve got a great new technology around cell therapy. You may read about this paper about this in the paper is business, a real thing. A good example of cell therapy is occurring in the treatment of Melanola, a very deadly type of skin care sir. And now with key cell therapy we’re finding there are ways to blunt this deadly disease and really knock it back. And it comes from taking cells out of your own body, so your immune system won't reject them. Purifying them out, multiplying them up, maybe injecting with them with the modification to make them more robust, and then injecting them back into the patient’s body for therapy. We are building out the factories in our life science business that enable our customers in the pharmaceutical industry to do this. This is a brand new space for us built out of great technologies coming out our research center.
You see many major trends around software and analytics. I’m just going to give you some examples of how these are playing out for GE in Software and Services and in our Advanced Manufacturing world as well. You know very well from your daily lives that the internet is everywhere and we use it very frequently. You can see already what happens when billions of people now are connected up. What happens when 50 billion machines are connected up? That is another whole day, and that is what we call the industrial internet.
We have built out a center in San Ramon, California where we have 1000 people already on top of the 6,000 to 8,000 software technologies we have across the company and they are building a platform that we call Predix that will enable every device inside the company to connect up in very effective ways, will enable the handling of large amounts of data in a very effective and cost effective way, and we’re spreading this around the company in very profound ways. We talked about the power of 1%. When we deliver as we will gains that are 1% and more in each of our businesses, we’re talking about incredible savings for our customers over the great installed base as we have of aircraft engines, MR machines, wind turbines, power generation turbines, you name it. We can power 1% for these devices, its $300 billion saved over the next 15 years, we are making this real.
Aviation is a good example of it. You’re seeing Predictivity Solutions coming out now built on top of our Predix platform that are helping our customers understand the operation of their fleets, minimizing the downtime that they have and boosting their productivity. You will see this as an internal benefit inside GE boosting our own productivity around dealing with customer service arrangements and in our customers who deal with their engines, their airplanes and their fleets and they have more effective ways. And we do intend to take this to other devices beyond GE’s installed base. Similar technologies apply in Advanced Manufacturing. The physical and digital worlds are indeed converging. When hardware meets software as only GE can do, we can take the company to a new place.
So Advanced Manufacturing, what's next? We are building what we call the digital thread that connects design information to the information thrown, flown to the factory floor all out into our service activities as well. We have great new tools with high performance Q computing with advanced materials and 3D printing to do things we couldn’t dream of before. And just for example with 3D printing we can make parts cost effectively, yes. But we can make configurations also that we simply could not make any other way opening up whole new avenues of performance, and we’re taking the data and analytics that I just mentioned we’re going to use in our installed bases back home to our factories to do what we call GE brilliant factories and drive our productivity up.
We have a role to spread technology across GE. A good example, I had all the engineering leaders in San Ramon in our software center just this week. We’re talking about spreading ideas including software as fast as we can across the company. This really is the power of GE. And I have to tell you that across aviation, transportation, healthcare, power-gen, you name it, our portfolio is the strongest that I have ever seen in my 35 years in the company.
So, just to close on again on how we work. The connection from my team in GE research is very deep with our businesses. Our job in the research center is to provide leading technologies to show ideas that can be feasible and can be made to happen and then to work with our business partners to do the really heavy lifting to make these into products and services to drive customer value and shareholder value at the same time.
So, thanks for listening. I could talk all day about the great portfolio that we have, but at this point I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you very much.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
That was great. Just to kick off maybe some kind of numerical questions and first of all, we’ve obviously seen the R&D budget increasing in the last several years. It seems that peaked and it seems to be tailing down a little bit at the ratio of sales, why is that? What's driving that reduction in R&D?
Mark Little
Well as we discussed we’ve gone from 2% to 3% of sales to 5% to 6%. We think that’s a very healthy level for us to be at. So, I see us sustaining that level as we move into the future. That’s a very good level for us. In terms of the industries that we compete in, that’s world class. So I think it’s a good place for us to stay.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And how is the mix, I mean I believe I’ve seen that pie chart breaking out that makes your team business driven R&D corporate which is much more, so disruptive technologies. How does that mix changing? Are you talking towards more disruptive technologies as time progresses?
Mark Little
That pie chart I showed us is for the GE research. The businesses do their own thing on top of that. So I would say that mix has been fairly steady. It fluctuates a little bit, because we like the model where the businesses are driving it. But that’s not to say businesses don’t invest in disruptive technologies, they do. Ceramic matrix composite that I showed you some detail was a good example of that. The aviation business has been investing along side of us for 20 years. The result of that is we have a material set that nobody else has and that’s a great advantage. So, they think forward and investment in forward as well.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And if you look at last 20 years, there’s been huge advances in gas turbines, aircraft engines, locomotive engines, much more efficient technologies and going forward, what do you think about the big advances going forward, is it material science, software, I mean what do you think is going to really take it to the next level?
Mark Little
It’s really all of that. People sometimes say, maybe we’re at the end of the recent technology we are nowhere near the end. You can see electronics getting cheaper, performance capability going up to get faster and faster responses. The material capability is getting ever better. So I think the world is still our oyster, we still have a long way to go and we’ll be pushing the envelop on all these things to bring greater technologies to life.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And does that mean the cycle, product cycles continue to accelerate. It seems that you’ve got lot of balls in the air right now. Does that continue, does that get ...?
Mark Little
I think so, yes. I think we’re getting ever faster. This is not stopping.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay. FastWorks, I have got to say, when it is launched to the world, I was somewhat skeptical that somebody of GE’s size and breadth could actually act like a startup. What does it mean? Just from your perspective, from your perch what does FastWorks mean (indiscernible) you?
Mark Little
So maybe I’ll just give you a little layer deep in the story of the whole thing. So, my great friend Beth Comstock was trying to help me and the technology team and the product team get some new ideas. So she introduced to us a young fellow, young for me anyway, Eric Ries, out of Silicon Valley. And Eric has written a book called Lean Startup. And he came to talk to again a bunch of people like me who have done a lot of things, pretty good experience based, and we’re looking at young Eric and thinking, how the hell is this software dude going to have anything to say to us. And yet his ideas were transformational for us. I went in completely skeptical about it. I came away completely enthused, and I have seen over and over again as we started out pilots, exactly that kind of transformation. Leadership teams coming in thinking this is probably stupid, nothing will happen to going away all fired up. So what's really happening? People are seeing that by trying things out, connecting with customers fast, learning and pivoting as we call it, they can go much faster and get much better results. Now that’s a big change for a company that used to say, give me the perfect product spec, give me equipment on delivery date, and all in between has to go just like clock work. And now we say, give me your product spec, try it out with your customers, adjust, get products out fast, learn, learn, learn. This is very exciting to people in our company. I have seen lots of corporate initiatives none has taken hold like this one because it’s just so right.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
So it’s gone pretty fast.
Mark Little
Very fast.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
I’m actually very impressed with the development cycle in the H-series. Is that the best, I mean going from, obviously you had a turbine to start off with. How much of a help was having that turbine, the steam cooled turbine moving to the air cooled turbine. How much reflective of that? Was the HA really a clean sheet design?
Mark Little
It has elements of a lot of things and part of what they did very clearly is they built off design elements that we already had and made only the modifications that were required to take it to the next level. It’s really quite a brilliant piece of design work that they did to enable us to get such a leap in size and performance in such a short time.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Yes. You touched on the trends towards more distributive power, which looks very exciting, but obviously we heard companies like Tedlar talking about distributed -- fuel storage, (indiscernible) storage, solar just some we may hear from GE so much, so what is your play on solar and engine storage?
Mark Little
Okay, two different things. So solar is a tough story I think for the industry. What you see is that the over capacity for panels is to focus on that piece of it. It’s very severe. You have a lot of manufacturers including the Chinese loosing a lot of money. We had a play to develop great technology. We bought a little startup company called PrimeStar. We combined them with the GE team and set a goal to get the efficiency up and the cost down. We exceeded every expectation I ever had by a lot, but yet the prices of the panels was so low, we didn’t think we could make any money. So, we put our plans to build our own capacity in the shelf and we transitioned our technology to First Solar. Now we continue to work with First Solar, and I have to tell you that the partnership is going beautifully, that the advances in this technology are profound and you’re going to see great efficiency in cost improvements continuing to go that way. Now they already have a capacity to make that. We didn’t want to invest to build the power capacity, so that’s a play there. But still the panel business is what it is. There are other places to play like the electronics businesses that go into the inverters. We have a wonderful new technology around silicon carbide power electronics. We just made an announcement with New York State they’re going to build out a capability to give us this in very significant quantity, drive the cost way down. That will play in solar, that will play in many other parts of our healthcare business, our aviation business, its going to be a great technology for us. Energy storage we have a business. We’re trying to build that up. Over time that will take a little while for that to get rolling, but we like the technology we have. Its not lithium ion, its different kind of technology. Lithium ion is good for power battery. Our battery is good for energy battery, so that’s an exciting space for us.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. Why don’t we go to the audience see if they have any questions? Any questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Unidentified Analyst
Great, thanks. If you could, of that R&D budget the 5%, could you break that down roughly, how much you think that is, is you’re pushing it to the industry versus the pull from the industry itself kind of asking for these whatever the innovation might actually be. So how much of it is a push versus a pull I guess?
Mark Little
Well, we engage with our customers from the beginning in a very significant way. Aviation is a wonderful example of it. We know intimately where the air-framers need
to go in the short-term and the long-term. And it’s very much a push and pull. They are pulling through what they want from us and we are pushing out our ideas. So it’s very much a give and take. Healthcare, the same kind of thing. We know what the industry needs and it varies. We have very high-end products like the Revolution CT. Now you might think that’s a US only market, its not. We’re selling more high-end CT’s in China than anywhere else. But we also have the value, the super value segments that are right for India and China in the developing world. So we work with customers everywhere to meet their needs whatever they may be.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Another question? So, I don’t normally like to talk about competitors on stage but LEAP-X is competing with our good friends up in (indiscernible) engine, and I know you’ve ripped apart that engine and had a good look at it. From your -- from a [ph] [purely] technology perspective, how does LEAP-X compare to the DCF? And what is it that’s causing customers to opt for LEAP-X versus aside from maybe history of the GE and having the server centers et cetera or from a [ph] [purely] technology perspective, how does it differ and what is the GE advantage?
Mark Little
So if you go back in time, we considered a geared approach as well and we’ve done a gear approach in the past long before our competitors have done it and we chose very consciously not to take that approach. We sometimes do what we call read team, blue team approaches where we get people from across the company, certainly the aviation business in this case, but people in power, water and transportation and anywhere where they might have ideas. And we challenged ourselves to think of the various approaches including a geared approach. And we came out of that exercise and others like it deciding that a geared approach was not the right approach from this application. Some other application some day may be but not for this one. And we chose to go down a path of advanced materials and other ceiling technologies and aerodynamics to give us a better play. We have thought that the addition of the extra component would add reliability and wave challenges and durability challenges that we could avoid by going the path we went. There are some advantages you get from being able to shrink the turbo machinery, those are real but we thought unbalanced they were not the right tradeoffs for us to make. We like the tradeoffs we made. We believe that even today LEAP has a performance advantage that we can sell to our customers. The market place is rewarding us for that our participating in the industry is quite robust as I think. So we like the bet that we’ve made.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
And is there a difference in the ability for the airlines to operate the engines in simple cycle times et cetera?
Mark Little
Well we think this will play. We have our own view of what the durability issues might be around a geared approach, and we think that will play out in time.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay. And then maybe finally I just want to touch on Alstom. Obviously you haven’t closed that deal yet, but from a technology perspective what do they bring to the GE portfolio?
Mark Little
Okay, just a personal story Nigel. So, back 15 years ago we bought Alstom’s gas turbine business. That was part of my portfolio, so I had the experience of integrating that business. I have to tell you it was a superb acquisition for us in every way. On the operating side and the probability side, to exceed every expectation we have. And my belief is that we will do the same kind of thing here. Alstom is a great add to our team, they have strengths that complement our strengths quite nicely. As you know we have tremendous strengths in gas turbines and in wind. They have some capabilities there, but they also have other things like steam technologies that are complementary to our combined cycle aspirations and to the big steam play we’re not so much right now. They have a very significant installed base which is great from a service perspective. They have heat recovery steam generator technologies that is good for combined cycle. As these things move increasingly to systems plays they have technology and what we would call our energy managed space that are very nicely fitting with us. So, I like it from every perspective. I think our shareholders will be quite relatively loyal for this one.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
And there is a perception out there that steam is a fairly commoditized technology. Why is that the (indiscernible)?
Mark Little
Well particularly for combined cycle where every bit of efficiency matters. They have invested in some quite competitive products. I think that will help us quite a lot. And the service side of steam is still a very robust thing. It has been for GE, it has been for Alstom, two together will be great.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
So the trend of two as combined cycle gas and steam, is that the next -- so obviously the H-series takes you further down the efficiency curve, but is the next level of efficiency improvements really optimizing the system gas steam together?
Mark Little
I think that in the near term that is definitely the next plan. I think you’re going to see some nice benefits out of that.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Great.
Mark Little
But the big steam play is also quite interesting. They have some really very good technology that we don’t have.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley
Okay, great. Well, Mark we’re out of time. Thanks for your comments.
