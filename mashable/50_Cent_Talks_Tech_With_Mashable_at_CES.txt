50 Cent Talks Tech With Mashable at CES

LAS VEGAS –- You may know that 50 Cent has his own line of headphones. What you may not realize is the rap superstar is also the majority owner and CEO of the company making them.
2013 marks 50’s third CES, his second with his company SMS Audio, which manufacturers high-end headphones and earbuds. Unlike other artists who have their own line of audio products, 50 is a key decision maker in the company, and has control over every step of the process — from the audio quality of the headphones to their design and packaging. 
One big business decision he’s made is to partner with FeedAmerica, a charity that helps feed the underprivileged in the United States. Every set of headphones sold provides 250 meals through that program.
We caught up with 50 on the CES show floor and spoke to him for a few minutes about what 2013 has in store for his company. Check out the interview above, and let us know in the comments what you think his company should make next.
