Need a Rugged Tablet? Panasonic Has Two New Toughpads
Panasonic has launched two new Toughpad tablets at the 2013 International CES show, one running Android and the other based on Windows 8 Pro. 
The FZ-G1 (pictured above) runs Windows 8 Pro and is quite a powerful beast, with a 10-inch, 1,920x1,200 pixel display, a 1.9GHz Intel i5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, while the microSD slot is an option. 
On the connectivity front, it packs USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, wired LAN, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and — optionally — a Verizon LTE or 3G chip. 
The Android-based JT-B1 (pictured below) sports a 7-inch, 1,024x600 display, a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage memory, further expandable via microSD cards. It also has a 13-megapixel camera on the back and a 1.3-megapixel one on the front. 
As far as connectivity goes, it comes with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and an optional LTE+3G chip. 

As is customary for Panasonic's Toughpad line of products, both tablets are resistant to drops, fluid ingress and extreme temperatures. 
The difference in power is also reflected in the price, as the Toughpad FZ-G1 will cost $2,900 when it arrives in March, while its smaller Android brother comes in February and costs $1,300.
