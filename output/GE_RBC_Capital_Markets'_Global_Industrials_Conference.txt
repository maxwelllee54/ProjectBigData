Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets
Deane Dray
Get started with our next presentation. We're delighted to have GE joining us here. For those of you on the webcast also welcoming those listeners again it's Deane Dray senior analyst with RBC covering the multi-industry group. We are delighted to have Mark Begor joining us from -- he is the CEO of GE Energy Management. I have been -- I know embarrassed Mark when say this, but I've always referred to him as Mr. Fix It at GE. When ever there is a big operating challenge within the organization, somehow they seem to send you in a hurry.
Mark Begor
I think that's true.
Deane Dray
So I say that with sincere flattery. So prior to energy management, Mark was the CEO of GE Real Estate. He was also the CFO of NBC [ph] and he has been with GE since 1980.
Mark Begor
Thanks for that.
Deane Dray
You know put that part in but that still sound as bad as 35 years.
Mark Begor
Yes, right.
Deane Dray
There is longevity there.
Mark Begor
Right.
Deane Dray
So within there -- there is a lot that's been in the news. I always consider you to be one of the GE insiders as well and you got a terrific perspective on the opportunity that is now coming together nicely with Alstom. It's topical. This week we got the combined approval from the EU --
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
And the U.S. Antitrust and the concession. So just give us your perspective of now having reached this milestone, the implications for GE.
Mark Begor
Yes, sure.
Deane Dray
And also for energy management?
Mark Begor
Yes. Perfect it's a -- it's obviously an exciting milestone for us. So we have been working on that for a long time. It feels like forever, we started out on April last year and 18 months later we are getting close to the finish line. And this week was a big milestone.
The Alstom deal for us is transformational for the power business and for energy management. It's the largest acquisition GE has ever done. It's an acquisition that we were very committed to as you know, we really focused on making sure that we got the deal done in a way that made sense to GE, as we finished up the process the returns were in the same place there when we started.
The synergies are actually larger, GE talked about I think on Tuesday, and we started a deal we thought it might be a $1 billion in change of synergies now. We see more like $3 billion of synergies which -- it was really quite attractive. And as we got into spending more time on the deal it was clear that we liked the opportunity more everyday. The people -- the opportunity the synergies and the growth potential.
So really excited. For the power business and Steve Bolz, who runs that the addition of the installed base, the service opportunities, growing his fleet by 50% is really a big deal. And I won't talk as much about that. But, for energy management it's also a big deal.
When we went into the Alstom transaction, the focus was really on the power side as you know, it was really what we focused on with Alstom to really expand that fleet to expand our service capabilities to expand our ability to grow in the power side. The focus wasn’t on the Alstom Grid business which is a $5 billion business in the high-voltage space that's going to come down to energy management.
As we got into the integration and into their process, we really realized it's also transformational for energy management. It completes our product line today. We are in the low-voltage space with industrial solutions. We've got a medium-voltage line in industrial solutions, our power conversion business and we had a very small high-voltage business. It was primarily North America focus called Digital Energy, it was $1.4 billion. So combining that $1.4 billion business in the high-voltage space along with the Alstom Grid business, it was $5 billion really takes us from kind of 7 or 8 or however you define it in that high-voltage marketplace up to number 3. So real player.
The synergies are massive on my side and energy management, we expect to take the margins of the combined Alstom Grid in digital energy business which are in the kind of mid-single digits up to double-digit in the next three years through the synergies. And that's primarily caused synergies, it's SG&A savings, its plant consolidations, it's technology savings the kind of things you would expect when you are putting two businesses together.
The other thing we are really excited about is that product line we now have that really fills out our product line. It allows us to be a better partner to the GE industrial businesses. And as you know everything we sell whether it's a turbine, some water equipment, some oil and gas equipment, either uses electricity and as to hook up to the grid or generates electricity it has to go out to the grid.
In today energy management doesn't participate in that electrical equipment pull through with the industrial businesses. We call it GE4GE or the electrical balance of plant is the initiative. Today we get pull through in energy management $7.5 billion of -- a little north of $100 million of pull through with the industrial businesses whether it's the power business, the water business or oil and gas.
We are going to grow that to maybe 250 this year. The opportunity for us is north of $1 billion a year of incremental revenue by having that full product line and going out to the marketplace with not only the turbine but also the electrical equipment to hook that turbine up to the grid. And our competitors do that today.
Today we go out to the marketplace and the power side just with the turbine and we are very successful in selling those turbines. But, we don't sell the electrical equipment that's really provided by other players, our competitors. Tomorrow our focus is to really get that pull through.
So if you look at the combination, the energy management side of the synergies that come from that combination normal acquisition synergies that come through and then the growth potential on top of the core growth rate in that business that comes from that GE4GE or electrical balance of plant pull through. We are really energized about the Alstom acquisition. And the one more point on the acquisition is, we have been added for long time. We've added 100 people on my side, a couple of 100 people on the -- we are certainly ready to go. But, we've got this thing analyzed down to the nickel.
We've been having integration meetings for 18 months. Our teams were collocated in Paris with the Alstom team. So we are really organized about the acquisition and when we get to closing in a couple of weeks in the fourth quarter. We are going to be off to the races of executing on that integration. I think Jeff and GE has been clear about the accretion next year is quite attractive and when we get out to 2018, we believe the combined Alstom acquisition is going to deliver $0.15 to $0.20 of accretion which is quite attractive and inline of when we started at 18 months ago.
Deane Dray
Given the fact that there was an expectation there would be concessions.
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
And back in May, Jeff and I drew the line in the sand and but you never know --
Mark Begor
Sure.
Deane Dray
Because I remember the LASKO round with EU with GE and Honeywell. And so help us understand what concessions are actually -- just frame the concessions. We know specifically the idea, the pieces that have to be divested. But, maybe just one that that caught people a little bit by surprise and it doesn't look like it's a big economic impact or the service contract on the gas turbine.
Mark Begor
Sure.
Deane Dray
I know that's not your business.
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
But you got your perspective on it.
Mark Begor
Yes. It's one that was important to the regulatory process with European commission and we were going through that process with them. We are comfortable that it doesn't impact the deal economics. So we've been clear about that. There are a handful of service contracts that will go with technology to [indiscernible] and as we go forward. We think we can be a very strong competitor in the space as they will and given our scale we are prepared to march forward on that. And nothing on the Alstom Grid side, so there was really no issues over on our side, so we are really just focused on integration.
Deane Dray
So on that point of integration, if you had the ability for 18 months to kind of map this out.
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
Any sense of what's going to cause you to integrate the assets?
Mark Begor
Yes. It's -- there is overall number GE, there is cost in the power side and on the energy management side. But those -- the cost of the integration are very quick pay backs. These are 12 months, 18-month, 24-month kind of pay backs depending up on the different ones that we are going to be executing whether it's reductions in overhead kind of people that will certainly do plant consolidations that will charge forward on. But, they are going to be very high pay back numbers that will be quite attractive from a return standpoint.
Deane Dray
Now, you still have other mandates at energy --
Mark Begor
In the core business.
Deane Dray
In the core biz, so kind of take us through the core business because there is big margin opportunity. You kind of frame the mandate and I will translate the margin.
Mark Begor
So core business is $7.5 billion with Alstom Grid will grow to close to $13 billion when you add that in. In the core business, this is a business that has not performed the way it should as a GE business. Our margins have been well below our competitors in the core business which is that $7.5 billion, our competitors' pretax returns are in the teens some mid-teens, some low-teens. And ours have been the low-single digits. So lot of opportunity to run it better and that's what I've been focused on since I joined energy management.
We have done a ton of restructuring plant consolidations, reductions in SG&A really focusing the team and running it the way a GE business should be done. Last year, we grew our margins about 170 basis points and doubled our pretax earnings and grew margins about 170 basis points. We expect to have the same kind of growth in margins this year in 2015 close to a doubling of our pretax earnings a little south of that but about 170 basis points close to 200 margin accretion.
So we will be in the kind of mid -- higher mid single-digit margins at the end of this year. And our path is to get to 10% by 2018 in the core business. And we feel quite confident, our ability to go from call it 6% to 7% this year to 10% by 2018, really from all the actions we have in flight.
We have initiated restructurings and plant consolidations in 2014 that are going to roll out late this year and next year. So we already see a line of sight of north of $100 million of cost benefits in 2016 that are really going to be implemented through the plant consolidations and other cost actions that we are taking. And we've got more of those that we are going to implement in 2017 and 2018 and some of these actually benefit 2017 and 2018.
The other area that we have done is investigating in new products. This is a business that was starved a bit for investment dollars around new products, our products were aged in the marketplace and we're investing heavily. One of our core products we're investing in is our new circuit breaker line, we call [Guardian] [ph] and that's one we're reducing the part count in the product by over 20% the cost is going to come down by over 20%, just give us a better product in the marketplace is lower cost. So new products is another area that's really helping us fuel our margins as we go forward to 2016, 2017 and 2018.
We got a lot of confidence around getting to that double-digit. The path after 2018 is how do you go from 10 to kind of the mid-single digit. The mid-teens where our competitors are and that's going to come from some of this pull through growth that I talked about. This GE4GE of really partnering with the GE business is accelerating our top line growth by getting that electrical equipment pull through that goes with the equipment that we're selling across GE.
Deane Dray
You also have some of that headwinds with oil that's within number of the companies that have been here this week of facing the same challenge.
Mark Begor
Sure.
Deane Dray
What are the unique challenges for energy management in the oil space?
Mark Begor
Yes. We're more muted in that -- as you may know this, the equipment that we sell to the oil and gas base is a fairly small percentage of energy management. We're big to the utilities, we're big to industrial customers, we're big in commercial construction is a big part of where our electrical goes. So oil and gas is kind of less than 10%, in that 10% we're a lot in the marine side so the marine exploration from our power conversion business which is a great business that's in the midst of a turnaround also in power conversion, but we've been growing our market share in that rotating machines and marine propulsion space that's been quite effective.
The other thing, the flip side of the challenge of the top line has been benefits in the bottom line. With lower oil a lot of the commodities that we buy a lot of the equipment that we buy and components we buy, we've been working on the sourcing side and getting some deflation for lower cost there. We're also getting savings in transportation, moving our stuff either on the inbound or outbound side to customers or inbound from suppliers has been a savings for us.
May be just a minute on power conversion, which is that acquisition we made four years ago called Converteam. It's a business that makes very large scale electric motors that are used in industrial and marine applications and oil and gas. It's a business where we've got a very high technology focus. And we also make the electrical equipment that manages those motors. And it's a business where in particular in the renewal space we're really winning. It's a place that whether it's in wind application where we make the generator in the electrical equipment that manages that wind tower.
We're in the solar space where we're selling the inverters and we actually had announcement this morning with the NextEra about a new relationship with them that's quite large where we're selling our market leading 1.5 kilovolt inverter technology that we're really doing quite well in the marketplace where they are quite excited about. So if there is a utility grade or a scale solar farm going in we're doing very well in selling into the inverters into that space. So we have big relationships with a lot of the big players in the solar space so that the power conversation business is one that is really growing its business on the top line but also executing on the bottom line.
Last year their margins were quite low in the single digits, this year they'll get up kind of in the mid singles, but that's a business that should be north of 10% by the time we get to 2018 because of the success that they're having in the marketplace as well as the improvements we're making in the operations of the business.
Deane Dray
The impact of renewables as a vertical for you, if you will.
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
Last quarter you showed some huge growth numbers. Is that more one-time order or is that…
Mark Begor
It's not. It's really the technology that I talked about. We've invested heavily in the generator technology in the wind side and then in the electrical equipment the inverters that are used in the solar farms and in the wind farms is one where we have a market leading technology right now. So we're picking up some share and we're winning really quite effectively in the marketplace. So as you said we've had orders growth rates that are in the 30% range in power conversion they got a backlog that's close to $4 billion, $1 billion of that's in the renewal space and solar and wind close to $1 billion of backlog so it's a great stream for us going forward.
Deane Dray
Since we have you here and it's -- we got these mandates or the goals from Jeff Bornstein and he'll say…
Mark Begor
So do I.
Deane Dray
Yes, okay.
Mark Begor
He is our CFO.
Deane Dray
I want to see how it trickles down to a business --
Mark Begor
Quite directly.
Deane Dray
Okay. Directly, so how do you overlay your business in the goals that are being set for a gross margin improvement, SG&A improvement, the number of P&Ls that will be eliminated just -- at a high level how does that translate those mandates that we hear as a goal macro for the company, how does it translate to your business?
Mark Begor
I think the change that GE made in our compensation system, it started on January 1. We have the same compensation system around bonus tied to metrics that were really more at a higher GE level for 30 years. In January it was changed to be more of a metric specific inside of each business and it was a game changer for us and you might ask why do we wait so long, that's a different question, but we're doing it now. But the alignment between the business performance and the way we get paid is exactly the way you want it because we're aligned around revenue growth, we're aligned around cash generation, we're aligned around margin growth and we're aligned around pre-tax earnings or operating profit growth. And if we deliver on the metrics that are tied together in the whole GE equation we're going to get an attractive bonus, if we don't we're not.
And what its done is really energized the team even more around the those key metrics that really are important to investors and really drive the value in a company like GE top line growth, improving your margins, gross margins and all the way through your cost structure, your bottom line performance in profitability and then add to that your working capital performance and free cash flow that we generate in. Those are very clear metrics, they tie together at the GE level. We win if GE wins and we win if our business delivers. So that alignment is really changing the game.
The other element that really has changed is working together in GE by having that clear alignment around the metrics that GE4GE around electrical balance of plan. There is a real dialog now with the turbine sales person who historically would go out and sell the turbine and today we're asking him to not only sell the turbine but also sell the electrical equipment with it because of its new alignment around the measurements. So it's really game changing.
Deane Dray
And sell the water too.
Mark Begor
And sell the water along with it, but really sell the whole basket of GE equipment through the GE store and really make sure we capture all of that opportunity that's available to us and it's a big growth place for us. But it's changed the energy, it's changed the accountability and I believe it's going to change the performance in a positive way of all the GE businesses.
Deane Dray
A different topic and this is mandate that Jeff Immelt has talked about in terms and where he thinks the biggest changes will be on how GE plays in the industrial Internet and the Predix software and may be just frame for us how that translates to your business and what the opportunities are?
Mark Begor
Yes. It's a big deal. It's a very big deal in power and oil and gas and all the industrial businesses, for us in energy management. When we add Alstom Grid in inside of our little less than $13 billion business would be a $500 million software business so pure software business. Part of that business is based in Redmond, Washington right around the corner from Microsoft, the Alstom Grid has a couple of 100 people up there. And this business makes software for utilities in the United States and around the world to manage their grids. So in the control rooms of the grid the software is provided by GE and by Alstom Grid together that's going to be $500 million. What we're going to be doing is really integrating in with our software COE in San Ramon and taking a lot of the Predix capabilities and embedding that into our software that we take to the utility market place which will really improve it.
For example the user interface capabilities that are coming out of our centralized software COE in San Ramon are far sophisticated what we have today in our software packages that we sell in the marketplace. It's going to make a better product for us going out to the marketplace. And all of the GE businesses are doing that. In our software center in San Ramon, we have energy management people that are collocated with power people with the corporate, software team and I don't know Deane may be you've been there to San Ramon so you've seen it in action and it's really quite exciting about where we're going.
We're really believe the idea of connecting all of GE's equipment for analytics and monitoring to improve the performance for our customers and help grow our service business through those analytics is a huge growth play for the company. GE has been talking about it. And we're serious about it. We're putting resources behind it and it's going to be a big deal for energy management.
On the pure equipment side, there is real opportunities for us to do more monitoring of some of the electrical equipment that we do sell to utilities and industrial users. For example large transformers on how the transformer oil and the transformers actually performing of monitoring that is a big deal and if you were an industrial utility customer to have a transformer go down and have a plant shutdown or a grid shutdown is a disaster. So that analytics and monitoring is also a play for us inside of energy management.
Deane Dray
I want to make sure I have time -- leave time for any questions from the audience. Not seeing hands shoot up. How about China? From macro standpoint we can see lots of worry points but how does that translate for your businesses?
Mark Begor
Yes. I just left the two day GE meeting, it's our corporate executive council were Jeff pulls together all of the business leaders and we talk about all the business operations. So quite fresh to hear from Steve Bolz in power and David Joyce in the aviation business. And China clearly is slowing down but it's still at an attractive growth rate. A lot of the stuff that we provide into China and other markets around the world that run effective for example the aviation side is still on fire, right? People are traveling like crazy in China. They are buying more planes. That set a certain spark. We do a lot of work in the power business, Steve Bolz's business in China still quite attractive.
In energy management, our exposure to China is fairly small. It gets a little bit larger with Alstom Grid. It's a place that we want to grow in. But it's not a big piece of our market. When we look at China kind of high-single digit growth rate is still a very attractive growth rate. We talk about it slowing, but many economies around the world would love to have high-single digits versus low-single digit kind of growth rate.
Deane Dray
Are there within the portfolio management, just go back on the core business?
Mark Begor
Yes.
Deane Dray
Divestiture candidates and how you are looking at those and what are the opportunities?
Mark Begor
Yes. It would be minor in energy management. We think the portfolio we have is the right one. Having the low voltage and medium voltage portfolio now with the high voltage gives us the full line to go to customers with, but also to partner on the GE side. And there will be some small pieces around the fringe that we may look at divestitures but that will be quite small.
We think the right core business is in front of us. And our focus really for the next year 24, 36 months is really executing the plan of the core business driving those margins up from that single digit to 10 and north of 10. And we feel a real -- we feel like we have a very executable plan to get the core business up to 10%. And you will see that quarter-by-quarter improvements, year-over-year improvements as we march forward.
And then the second is to execute the integration. It's a lot of work. We have a great plan, but the ability to take the margins in the Alstom grid business from kind of mid-single digits up to 10 or north of 10 through the synergies is in our sights. And it's just a matter of executing it.
Deane Dray
What's the branding of that business?
Mark Begor
Yes, great question. We are going to call Grid Solutions. We call large digital energy. They call there is Alstom Grid, the new combined business we are going to call Grid Solutions. So we will have industrial solutions is our low-voltage business, power conversion is our rotating machines motor controlled business. And then Grid Solutions will be our high-voltage business underneath the energy management umbrella.
Deane Dray
Terrific. And next milestones for you in the integration process?
Mark Begor
Close the deal so we can get to work. We're excited about it. We plan this thing to depth. So we have been ready go for quite some time. And as I said earlier, when you look back to last April, we are 10x more energized today than we were in April. We like the deal in April. We really like it now. So we are ready to go get it integrated. We like the people. We like the global footprint it gives us. We like their project capabilities. We like the broader product line. The GE leverage of pulling through the high-voltage equipment with the GE businesses, it's going to be a great deal for GE.
Deane Dray
Terrific. I'm going to end it there. Mark appreciate you and GE being here today.
Mark Begor
Great. Thanks for having us.
Deane Dray
Thanks.
