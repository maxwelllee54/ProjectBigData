Psy Bringing 'Gangnam Style' to Wonderful Pistachios Super Bowl Ad
Get crackin' â€” "Gangnam Style." 
That's the slogan of the forthcoming Wonderful Pistachios Super Bowl campaign featuring South Korean pop star Psy. The rapper achieved worldwide recognition last year for his music video "Gangnam Style," the first to hit 1 billion views on YouTube.
The spot doesn't air until Feb. 3, but Wonderful Pistachios is already trying to build buzz for the campaign, namely on Facebook, where a related photo sweepstakes will kick off this week.
Although some fans are enthusiastic, many took to the comments of Wonderful Pistachios' Facebook page to air their disappointment with the choice. Citing an anti-American rap song Psy produced in 2004, Tiffany Timmons Carter wrote, "This guy should get no endorsements. Having a song about killing Americans is disgusting and should not be tolerated."
"No you didn't!" wrote Tina Arkus Obert further down the thread. "I thought I loved wonderful pistachios! I now question your judgement [sic]."
This marks Psy's first appearance in a U.S. TV commercial.
