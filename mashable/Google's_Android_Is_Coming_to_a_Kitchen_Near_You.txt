Google's Android Is Coming to a Kitchen Near You

Android users can vouch for the perks of large screens, custom widgets, and now, optimum rice cooking. 
Google is expanding its free operating system to rice cookers, refrigerators and other home appliances. Adding the OS to more devices would be useful in helping Google and other manufacturers collect data, and also allow appliances to exchange information. 
In the case of rice cookers, the device would be able to determine the type of rice and set cooking instructions. Other intelligent systems could signal an alert from a washing machine to your TV, letting you know when it's done. Check out the video above for more. 
The International Data Corporation predicts the market for Internet-connected devices will reach $2 trillion in 2015, and Google is responding to the demand. Android-operating products made an appearance at CES in Las Vegas this week, including LG's Smart ThinQ Refrigerator, which can wirelessly connect and preheat LG's SmartOven. 
Appliance makers operating on Android, like Samsung and Panasonic, have the ability to add their own features to the product. Panasonic already provides cloud-based services in Japan for its microwave oven and rice cooker, so users can search for recipes and program instructions using their smartphones. 
Would you buy these smart home appliances? Do you think integrating operating systems is convenient for customers? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
