Reeddit Offers a Fresh Face for Reddit

Addicted to browsing Reddit? You're not alone. 
A new app called Reeddit, designed by coder Bernardo Baquero Stand, compiles all the goods from the social news site — links, images, comments — into one minimalist, read-only format for both web and mobile devices. 
Reeddit lets you create a custom list of channels with up to three subreddits in each — similar to how you would customize a Twitter search using Tweetdeck.

As of now Reeddit is "read-only," meaning users don't have the ability to upvote, downvote or leave comments on anything. Read more about it here.
