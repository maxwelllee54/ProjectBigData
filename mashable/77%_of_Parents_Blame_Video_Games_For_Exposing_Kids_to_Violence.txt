77% of Parents Blame Video Games For Exposing Kids to Violence
A new study from Common Sense Media shows the majority of parents (75%) feel that shielding children from violence is difficult. That same percentage of parents blame "media violence, such as content in TV, movies and video games" for adding to "Americaâ€™s culture of violence." 
For this survey, conducted by USA Market Research, 1,050 parents with children ages 18 years and younger were randomly selected to share their opinions.
Results revealed that 88% of parents said violent ads should be prevented from airing during programs largely watched by children. What's more, 91% want theaters to show previews that only have the same or lower rating than the movie being shown.

"Parents are clearly concerned about how violence in media may be impacting their children," James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said in a statement. "Our culture of violence seems to have made it the new normal that parents who take their kids to a movie theatre or gather to watch a football game are at risk of exposing them to inappropriate content that is marketing video games, or films rated for more mature audiences."
In addition to content that children see in the media, parents were also asked about other factors contributing to violence in America. Parents said they worry about bullying (92%), access to guns (75%) and current levels of crime (86%).
