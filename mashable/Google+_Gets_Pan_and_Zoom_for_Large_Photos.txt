Google+ Gets Pan and Zoom for Large Photos
Google has introduced the ability to pan and zoom large photos on its social network, Google+. 
Users can now use their mouse wheel to zoom in or out when watching high-resolution photos. Also, clicking and dragging will pan the photo in any direction. 
The same can be done on touch-sensitive trackpads, such as the one on Apple's MacBook Pro. 
The new feature, announced by Google's Dave Cohen on his Google+ profile, comes weeks after Google launched full-size backups for Android photos.
