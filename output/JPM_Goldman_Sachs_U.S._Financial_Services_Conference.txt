So we are delighted to have Marianne Lake up next. Marianne is completing her second year as CFO of JPMorgan. And I think it’s fair to say that in a very short period of time she has established herself as one of the stand-out CFOs in the banking industry. So Marianne, thank you very much for joining us.
In the lights of the announcement that came out yesterday, I think we will start with that, because I know it’s in a lot of people’s minds, and obviously recognizing that it is an NPR, there obviously could be a number of changes. Can I just start off by asking, based on your understanding of the document, is your capital ratio going to go up to 11.5% as a minimum?
Marianne Lake
Yes, so – thanks for having me by the way, pleasure to be here. So yes, I would say that one of the pieces that’s most unclear is how you calculate the additional short term wholesale funding add on, we have done already maths on it. But regardless of that, if you strip out the substitutability and take the remaining four categories that were in the previous G-SIBs and double them that would put off a loan at the 4% bucket but I think it is reasonable, plus given the comments that were made yesterday for us to assume that we are in a 4.5% bucket which – and therefore 11.5% minimum which quite frankly isn’t the entire the price given that there were [indiscernible] back in September, they also found something, so it was going to be a large U.S. run institution in that 4.5% bucket that was at least the fighting chance that it was going to be JPMorgan, that we’ve obviously been online and as they don’t show on yours for a period of time. It doesn’t change that by the way, it probably here today, we consider ourselves to be a very well capitalized company with appropriately conservative liquidity and an operating model that has demonstrated adaptability and resiliency. So I am sure that we’ll delve into all of that but –
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
So starting, if we assume that this actually does possibly, does become an 11.5, what do you think is an appropriate buffer? Because I know you have said before that a 100 basis points doesn’t necessarily continue to apply as the minimum goes up. So again assuming that it is 11.5, what do you think your operating capital level would be?
Marianne Lake
So when we set our buffer back some time ago, maybe it’s nearly two years ago now actually to be 50 and 100 basis points. The reason that we had a range in there was to allow for degrees of uncertainty on them to finish things. And while there still is some uncertainty, I think you would agree that there is a higher degree of certainty today on many of those things. So we haven’t actually come out and reaffirmed our buffer. It’s likely to be closer to the low end of that range. So I would use good folks see 50 basis points plus or minus. And the biggest reason for needing it, wanting it and calibrating it, which we will refine for you over the course of the coming months is related to the AOCI volatility, and the fact that you don’t want to have a short term potential hit to capital, even if you will earn out today over the medium term, that could end up limiting all the reasons the way that you don’t want to do. When we decide to have that softer, I think it’s all going to depend on how quickly we need to get there.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
I think one of the things that people I think is talking – sure, go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Can I say one further – I think I am sure it’s entirely not from everyone here that the fact that we have moved from 250 basis points to 450 basis points has got very little to do with short term wholesale funding if anything. It’s got everything to do with the fact that one of the buckets that contributed 50 basis points to our previous 250, opted out, and another which we understand is likely to contribute 50 basis points came in and we took the rest in couple days. So it’s less to do with any of that, it’s been sort of in the rhetoric and narrative, and much more to do with taking an existing Basel framework which was really calibrated and over indexed to seismic risks, doubling and therefore amplifying that effect, because JPMorgan is big and big in what we do, then it has outside speculative.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
I think the surprise to some people was your complexity score twice that of people – that I think people would really consider to be UK, such as Bank of America. What do you think is driving that? And I guess secondly, are there various things that you can do around business simplification to bring that score down? Because it does seem as if this new surcharge is not custom, as you start to change aspects of your business, your capital ratios will fall. So I guess two things, first is, how important is that for you to move down into a lower category? And secondly, what do you think it is about your business that is contributing to that high score in complexity in particular?
Marianne Lake
So – and because the word complexity is used to describe the category, I think people will obviously reach the conclusion that, that would mean we are more complex. It does mean we are bigger in the derivative side primarily. And the biggest driver – the three drivers in that bucket are OTC derivatives, Level III assets, and IFS securities and the like. So basically the thing that’s driving is the size of our derivatives book describes by notional [ph]. So as a result, fundamentally to reduce that score, prima facie is to do something to the derivative business. So I think the first questions that you ask is when you get there, because I am going to come back to managing the score is at 11.5%, do you feel that JPMorgan, if the corridor that we have to navigate relative to our most material page is 50, 100 even more basis points, are we able to deliver an appropriate return or what that incremental capital looks like? And we would say to that yes and I will come back to that in a second. If the case to analyst right now – when I say it shouldn’t come as surprise, obviously we were hoping slightly different. But in analyst models right now, analysts have us accreting capital to 11, 11.5% and ultimately 12% over the course of the next three years. And if you do some really sort of basics to give me some certain basic maths, but if you take analyst estimate for net income for ’15, and ’16, if you extrapolate that into ’17, if you take $1.5 trillion risk weighted asset level which is where we said we would be at the end of 2015 and we may be better than that but just take that for the sake of argument, and I am not leading you to any conclusions here. But if you backstop, when you use a 75% net payout ratios, for each of the next three years, we would accrete that 50 basis points of capital a year. So from 10.1% at the end of the third quarter, we will be at 10.3% plus or minus at the end of the fourth quarter, will be close to 11.5 and 12% while being able to continue to distribute meaningful capital, which has been a strategy that we have been employing for a period of time which is to have a measured approach to reaching our targets, not necessarily raising a 4% of urgency, but measuring that against the flexibility on the capital space. And you only have to believe just what’s working, we said at the investor day, you only have to believe at $6 billion of our great synergies incremental because of our operating model, because of the businesses, the scale, the platform we have, the client relationships, the market share, to support that 100 basis points, it’s that in fact where it is.
The second question that I think that we need to ask is we are not [ph] the people drift off for a variety of reasons, whether that’s stress testing, whether it’s buffers, I know that we’ve heard some people say they are going to end up for 100% payout, I am not sure that the entire industry is going to be that bold this year. So you would see the majority of our competitors already at or above 10.5%, so it’s entirely possible that, that 11% is more of where the cost to come but I think markets also will have some impact on that. Is it important to ask a manage school, yes, absolutely and it is important to ask to maximize returns on the capital we have and to make sure we are able to do that in the most efficient way, we would clearly like to be able to reduce the – by 50 basis points and if that is possible, we will do it, but we are not looking to do that at the cost of making more than surgical changes to our business strategy because the biggest contributor to our G-SIBs broadly defined, is the CIB, and to be able to move meaningful down the bucket, is to do meaningful – like meaningful change to that surgical.
And so I am sure we will talk later about the profitability, the returns elements of that business but it’s not at this point our strategy to do anything to more than surgically improve that.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Obviously the CCAR submission is due pretty soon. I think you’ve talked about returning mature capital. Does this NPR in anyway impact how you would have thought about capital returns for 2015?
Marianne Lake
Well obviously there’s a working treaty current, I am not going to get into what we are doing. The board is still deliberating over, we don’t do but not really if you think about in the context of it has served us very well to have this sort of dual pass of making sure that we are adding to our capital on a gly-path that more than meets the timeline required by the regulators but does not raise the compliance so far, and at the same time has enough dry power. We’ve talked about the fact that we want to increase our dividends iteratively to ultimately hopefully a 50 bp payout obviously not likely to be in 2015 circa and to continue to have the optionality and the flexibility to be able to do buybacks of values, that really is the case. So where that lands up in the less than 100 but not where we were last year category, we will see.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
So just transitional, a little bit away from the regulatory just for a minute, although I am sure we will come back to it with some questions later on. I think last year you talked about 2014 as being a transition year.
Marianne Lake
Nicely, to give actually one more point. If you just to finish that for the crew mass buyback, if you then take a $27 billion net income number and you will end about with a number that we had [indiscernible] at our investor day, that we felt over the medium term subject into those caveats the things that are fairly certain that we would be delivering $27 billon of net income and they were meant for this audience and others who thought that might haven’t been a conservative assessment. If you take that $27 billion of net income in a two year time and we will debate that timing, you’ve got $1.5 trillion risk weighted asset that is 12% capitalization and it’s over 14% return on tangible common equity on a cost of capital that’s been falling and is at or potentially below $0.10. So that will start and that before you get to the optimization and refining which we will do.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Should I interpret that as being this doesn’t necessarily impact your ROE targets?
Marianne Lake
I mean I think it’s clearly obviously having higher capital put pressure on ROE targets particularly in the short term. But I think if you subscribe to that math, you will go away and you will figure out that he doesn’t like about it to be able to get to a 14% return before you have the chance to really internalize and optimize against that, I think is a very, very reflective of returns when it’s the cost of equity and I think we should be able to do better than that, whether it will be 15% and 16% we will see. We will obviously update you at investor day.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Okay. So if we can dig to a little bit about your outlook ex all the regulatory stuff going into next year, you are obviously going through your budgeting process. As you think about next year, what are the big deltas, you are building and in terms of your expectations either in terms of the economy or in terms of other aspects in terms of the operating environment. I guess, the one thing a lot of people are very focused on obviously the fall in the oil price. There is obviously puts and takes to your business. So if you could talk a little bit about how that’s impacted your outlook as well, that would be helpful.
Marianne Lake
So this is a – we will get to oil, I will come to that. We talked about 2014 as you know being a transition year in a lot of ways. A cyclical low end mortgage, that’s likely to the shift, I think we can all agree that the mortgage market in 2015 is likely to be small and very much more correlated to recovery in housing which has been slightly slow. And that’s our expectation, so challenging in 2015 although we will continue to work on and deliver the expense efficiencies that we have been working on and then talking about. And continue to gain share and that’s our objective in those segments of that business that we like not just now but through the next cycle which is the high quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. And we have been successful in the second half of 2013 on both of those funds.
Mortgage – in the market base in terms of we have seen in uptick in realized volatility particularly in FX rates, still however low relative to where you would expect it to be in a more private market, it’s not – we don’t have line of sight on the catalysts that would change that, a less it is rates in the middle of next year which I will talk about, so it’s possible that while we are going to see a little bit more volatility and hopefully that presents more opportunity, it’s likely the first half of next year at least is going to be continued to be challenging – somewhat challenging in their market space. So then it comes to the interest rate outlets that we have and just general the US economy. So we’re optimistic about the US economy, it’s continuing to recover strongly and steadily and more strongly, you have got – the sort of latter market is a bit soft performance that you have the good jumps [ph] report and we feel good about that, we are expecting wage both to continue and GDP, our outlook for the second half of 2014 is 3%, first half of ’15, 3%, little less in the second half that’s fundamentally in good shape. And while there are puts and takes on the oil price situation we think these are the positive, because well there are implications for CapEx and potentially for inflation over the a country impact to inflation, actually the benefit that the consumers will have in the near term should that weigh, so you have got really sort of good fundamentals in the consumer space, strong spend or we’ve got also sales for the off the charts and very robust total sales and business bank rejuvenation, an optimism generally in the consumer confident small and middle market base improving. So the landscape is better, but I think the trading environment and the mortgage environment will be challenging. We do expect rates to – based on the last Fed meeting it sounded to us like there was a plan and they better sticking to it and they have not seen anything that would deviate until that plan about point clearly that could still happen, we have to wait and see what happens in the near future and it’s our belief that there will be a rate rise in the mid of next year, June likely, if not June, in September and there’s bit of – based upon where inflation comes out. That’s the backup, thinking that for the second half of 2015 you could probably see greener shoots more momentum, more volatility, higher rates will gain momentum in 2016 and ’17 and because it’s happening for all the right reasons, and there might be some volatility in the expectation, because it’s happening for all the right reasons, it begets loan growth and confidence and all the things that are going to mean we get to that $27 billion plus.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
And then specifically on credit costs, should we expect a normalization of credit costs as interest rates go up and as the economy continues to normalize, what do you think the gap between those two is going to continue to remain quite wide?
Marianne Lake
It will remain quite wide for a reasonably extended periods. So it is the case that – I just talked about our outlook on interest rates but with respect to say our credit portfolio, there is obviously some legacy, run-off positions are still there but the portfolio we would make is very very high quality and not very correlated to interest rates. If you think about the consumer space, it’s much more driven by HPI or GDP or unemployment all of which hopefully when rates rise, they are rising because they are strong and strengthening, so that means there is still the improvement in the charge-offs in the consumer space albeit at a slower pace, and in the wholesale space, our outlook is pretty benign for a reasonable time on middle market, loans are well secured, our CIB loans are well rated, hedged, again not particularly the interest rate. So our outlook for credit for this year we said it’s less than $5 billion, that’s the same for next year, we expect it to be low again in 2016 and that’s relative to a longer term through the cycle that’s closer to $7 billion. Meanwhile rates will start compounding and in 2016 and 2017 are becoming strongly beneficial.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
With a lot of the new regulations do put a lot of pressure on growth and bank balance sheet. And I know Jamie has talked about the whole concept of balance sheet repricing. And if anything, I think current rules are probably accelerate maybe the margin. Can you talk a little bit about what you have seen so far and do you actually think that growth in demand for bank balance sheets will be a catalyst for some repricing in certain businesses?
Marianne Lake
Yes, I think so. But I think it’s going to be much more sort of iterative and evolutionary than it’s going to be a revolution so to speak. And I think when you look at someone like JPMorgan, the sort of – I will come but we are not leverage constrained, even lesser today than we were yesterday. And so when you are looking at things like balance sheet intensive activities like we pose are very strategic to our core clients, but our high ROE businesses meanwhile, we can be very strategic about putting that balance sheet to use for our clients, maximizing ROE because we have the capital support it. So having said that, we have been the beneficiary of a market wide slight repricing, repose and we are looking at client by client, the relationship and looking at repricing at the tail in a very measured way. And looking to rather build more business with those customers to be able to deliver in pipeline return, even if one product or another may not in its own right support its capital, rather than necessarily either exit that client or repricing in a hurry. So I think you are going to find there will be more of it, maybe there will be an acceleration but it will be a little bit less dramatic than potentially you could have thought.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
So I mean I think your point earlier that while this was – pace just impacting wholesale financing, it is actually targeting something else. Do you think that this stuff will have a further impact on liquidity and financial markets? And how do you think about that trade off between less leverage I guess in the financial system and less liquidity?
Marianne Lake
Yes, so I think we’re often asked this question a lot, clearly recently in terms of cause and effect and where that all stop, I think that the cumulative effect of all of the things that have happened including yesterday has had an impact on deal [ph] appetite and liquidity, not that is – the liquidity countries that we are seeing are episodic but what you are finding is that potentially the lack of dealer appetite is meaning people are not expecting in and creating a second phases that previously might have been there, so I think it’s more of a second order thing. I don’t think foresee that this necessarily has – it’s a cumulative things, that they have cumulatively it continues to increase but not substantially.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Maybe we can talk a little bit about the mortgage business. I mean that’s one area where I think there is a debate around the attractiveness of that business. When you think about the longer term returns in that business, how attractive do you think it is to you? And secondly, the FHFA rules came out recently, became into effect I think December 1. Has it in any way changed your thinking about your underwriting standards in that business?
Marianne Lake
So the first thing that – it’s a challenging business, it has been particularly challenging obviously in the most recent past and currently. The challenges really relate to the legacy servicing portfolio, I will come back to that in a minute. You have to ask yourselves – do you want to be in that business, and the answer for JPMorgan is JPMorgan Chase, yes we do. It is a cornerstone financial products for consumers. We are a large US bank and there’s going to be a number of parties who are able to succeed at generating an adequate return on that business in the next cycle and we want to be one of them and have that for our customers and be able to enjoy. So for us the strategic repositioning of that business has been about one thing for the next cycle to have a smaller higher quality and less volatile business, which means that we are targeting very specific segments of the borrowing base and not looking to continue to participate meaningfully in default servicing in the future. So obviously everything that FHFA and directive what can do in terms of clearer moves of the roads, for obviously data and services is incrementally beneficial and we would support it. But it’s really less about reps and warrants risk, or even about servicing timelines and compensatory fees, and more about the costs and the risks associated with servicing the defaulted loans, and so that is why you have found us we are pulling back on that and really wanting to play in a very high quality space and if that means a smaller business, so be it, price and adequate return.
In terms of our credit box, we obviously are continuing to look at expanding credit where we can do so, and the construct of that strategy that we talked about, but don’t think about our box as seeing meaningfully away from where we think it should be. And so at the margin we will obviously continue to look at that but new rules and regulations that should make credit availability more widespread across the GSC lending spectrum, it’s not going to have a significant impact on our credit box in the near term.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
And then lastly from me just on the expense side. You’ve talked about growth in control spending peaking this year. Do you think we can expect absolute declines next year as you start to institutionalize some of the new processes that you have put in place over the last few years?
Marianne Lake
So can I just talk broadly about expenses?
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Sure, yes.
Marianne Lake
Because that will be helpful. So there are three things that I think are going to provide positive leverage on the expense base. Our total adjusted expenses next year as of this year will go down, and there are – actually four reasons why that will happen, and there is an overlap between them. So obviously I was going to provide in four buckets. The first is Gordon talked to you about and committed to a $2 billion save in the consumer space exits ‘16 versus ’14, broadly 50:50 between mortgage and the consumer bank. Mortgage obviously on the back of declining volumes and defaulted servicing and efficiencies, that we are generating in the business through technology and operating models. And in the consumer space, largely around sort of automation, staffing models, yes, some bronze strategy and rotation strategies, so that’s one piece of it. Start to take effect in 2015, more in ’16.
And the CIB fund, although Daniel hasn’t actually sized it for you, will likely to do that for you at investor day. We still have a reasonable amount of hedge room in terms of efficiency in the CIB space and it’s everything from – we’ve obviously brought the organizations together now, but it’s everything from with end to end the engineering of the operating model across our products, our business as well as really continuing on the next phase of what was the value to sell strategic technology agenda and bringing the technology together across asset classes and the rotation in the rest. So there will be meaningful phase in operating leverage in the CIB space, business simplification features in both of those obviously, so I would give up a very good rate on executing on our business simplification agenda. We told you what it was going to be at the end of 2013. We are firm that in investor day with no new surprises – in ’14, end the year with it very substantially in our run rate, with no new plans to announce for you. So that’s another piece.
And then you have the control spend. The control spend, and it’s a bit of all of that but the control spend, with over $2 billion of incremental investments in the two years from ’12 to ‘14, over 13,000 people. Yes, reaching a peak and it will be in our run rate at that peak at the end of this year. It’s going to take some time to be in that but then it will. So exit 2015 and into ’16 you will see the benefits of that, a little bit less so in 2015 because we still have where to shop, we’re still actually in the process of completing a lot of that work although in the back half and in some cases even further than that. Well it’s anyone who is – we will do, we are maintaining or improving the quality of what we are doing because we are going to be seasoning the processes, maturing the operating models, automating the processes, finishing any backlogs, and looking at organizational efficiency. So over the medium term that has some real benefit in it, a little bit less so in 2015. But overall adjusted expense is down.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
Okay. So if I put all the pieces together from an operational standpoint, next year it sounds like it’s going to be a pretty decent year.
Marianne Lake
I think I would characterize next year as continuing in a transition phase, hopefully a better second half, a little bit more like 2014 and where we want to be in the – through the cycle state but very respectable.
Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs
All right. We have some time, so let me take some questions from the audience. I know we have some, Matt, do you want to – if you could wait for the mic, so that people on the webcast can pick it up.
Question-and-Answer Session
Unidentified Analyst
So Marianne, you spoke about the capital ratio gap, the figures on a spot basis. But if the Fed kind of incorporates the G-SIB surcharge into CCAR, given that you fare better than peers in CCAR, do you think that then re-levels the playing field?
Marianne Lake
First of all, I would say that this sort of for me – we worry about it, this puts in the category that’s a little premature to overly focus on it because in an NPR four comments that was the potential floor conversations – there was a lot of movement in that. Having said that it’s been clear even before this with the CCAR instructions that the door was fully less open for changing the minimums whether that’s inclusion of the G-SIB surcharge or not, in part or in whole. CCAR, one of the reasons why everybody is running out all around is 10, 10.5 or above level is that the G-SIB score card under the Basel framework works kind of added two sides and not risk and consequently people experience more severe strategies under the Strat Hudson [ph] was allowed for under the G-SIB, we were the one of the people who – maybe the only one who worked on CCAR constraints and at this point still – we have less of the stress sensitivity than some of our peers on a relative basis. So yes, we had and also by the way whether in a 4.5 bucket, others are in 3, 3.5, it’s not that everybody got the 2x factor, plus maybe 50 basis points in the short term wholesale funding. So it would continue to probably get that gap between us, I think all the sensitivity is slightly different, we will have to see as that comes through. It’s definitely not the case, all the way through the middle of 2016 that we know. So as we sit here today it’s the concern and we have to figure out what that means. I don’t know that it means that it’s a game changer on a relative basis yet.
Unidentified Analyst
A couple of questions on capital. Firstly, if you are operating 12% plus and other smaller banks a much less, I mean does that put you at a competitive disadvantage?
Marianne Lake
I didn’t know where the plus came from on that.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, you said at the low end of the 50 basis points buffer. But and then the other question was simply that globally capital standards seem to be continually drifting off – on and off. In order to maintain the certain level of ROE, how much re-pricing of assets that we have seen already and what areas you have seen relatively more or less re-pricing?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So I think relative – I think I made the point and hopefully it was clear, if it wasn’t, we can sort of continue to discuss it. But I think relative to our most meaningful large competitors, the gap is going to be whatever at that 100 basis points and that feels, it may likely continue effectively. So the question then you need to ask yourself is if you are in a commercial bank, or if you are in a consumer bank and you are competing against someone who has a wider gap in that, in the local market, because remember, we compete with everybody in the local markets in which we do business. Yes, in some cases that might be the case but we have a different offering for them too. If you take the commercial bank it’s a good example of that. Those organizations are rarely able to offer the services and the platform and the scale and the international capabilities that we can offer. So we have a different service proposition to them and so for our core customers, they are coming to us because they want that whole platform and that’s how we get the overall return on the relationship. So it might be that we have to price the loans below hurdles but that’s the case of relationship is above and that’s the whole conservation we’re having with those clients. If we can’t get there, then obviously that will be a either re-pricing or client exit situation but we want to do that with a view to what that will look like in the future, not necessarily spot today and over correct or overreact today.
So I think we rarely lose things on price because we have a different service proposition for our customers. As it relates to the sort of international versus US base and sort of evolving capital levels, I think you hopefully all agree that the US is kind of leading the charge in terms of reacting and increasing and I think what you will find, although I can’t evidence – it is just the global harmonization agenda will mean that there will be more convergence internationally towards that, and therefore I don’t necessarily at this moment anyway there is no another sort of clear and present danger for the US to go further except from that, the G-SIB potential in CCAR. So I feel like we have the chance I think to stabilize for a while, see the international landscape stabilized and the local jurisdictions determine how they want to implement these things many of whom may do it in a way that is more punitive than just the Basel framework. And some may not. But all things don’t have to be totally equal for us to be able to be successful. I mean time and time again over the last two years we have been asked, versus European banks, how can you compete if your leverage is 6 and theirs is 3, and at the end of the day we are competing effectively and in some cases gaining share. And so it is evident that all things are not equal, and there are lots of dynamics, some of which has to do with the economy but not everything.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks. Could you talk about what you are seeing in the operating environment in Q4 and specifically trading given the updates we’ve got from Citi and BofA yesterday as well as thoughts around NII, loan growth is okay but rates remain obviously very low. Thanks.
Marianne Lake
Okay. So let me do the trading a bit. So we talked I think at our earnings about the fact that although we had a bright September, as a result of the shopping and we obviously all observed the sort of volatility and situation in the middle of October and in that week. I will tell you that the year over year and [indiscernible] so that we can be directly comparable I think to the people that spoke yesterday. Year over year our reported markets revenues at this point in time and remember it’s over [ph] and December is quiet but it can change. Year over year our reported results would be down in the high teens, which isn’t our thought. There are three pieces to that. The first is we guided everybody and told you that because of business simplification that would drive, all other things equal, an 8% decline year over year on the exit of physical commodities primarily in G-SIB. There is a corresponding – that’s about $300 million. There is a corresponding expense reduction too, of the similar order of magnitude. So year over year that’s a reported decline, not as price fully guided to with expenses of the base too.
One other thing that – I don’t want to get drive into a complicated conversation, we certainly can go there. We have historically included in our business revenues as a net interest expense, the cost of preferreds that we allocate to that business. So we have charged the businesses as a net interest expense in that revenues for preferreds that they carry their overall capital structure. Meanwhile obviously for our firm it’s below the line in NII. We understand that is not what the vast majority of all of our competitors do, and consequently that drives year over year because of the increased issuances of prefs of 5% reported decline. In earnings in the fourth quarter we will talk more about that and potentially think about changing the way we present that. So what I really mean is our core performance in terms of year over year performance is 4% down, at this point it could be plus or minus a little bit on that but I think that’s broadly in line with not only the broad expectations of what people were generally guiding to yesterday. And in that, there are a few things happening. You’ve got equity up on strong equity derivatives, helped by the Bank of Japan, easing actions in the quarter, but just generally a fairly solid performance there. You’ve got a turnaround performance actually in currencies and emerging markets in the second half of the year, starting in September, continuing in the fourth quarter, so year over year performance are up. You had a bright moment in rates in the third quarter, the fourth quarter was more challenging but so was the fourth quarter of last year. So relatively neutral, and then a little bit slower of a strong quarter in credit last year and it’s not unusual for the FPG business, to be a little bit as slower when you see volatility in FX and in rate. So all other things being equal basically 4% down year over year, might change, a few more weeks to go.

I think you mentioned that before the short term financing component of the GSF you were at 4%, which essentially means that your short term financing business is at 50 basis points, do every other business you operate in. I guess how do you think about allocating that incremental capital charge and for somebody like yourself who gets on top on buffer, is it economical to being in the businesses?
Marianne Lake
Yes, so – by the way I want to qualify that it’s a tiny bid with – we have done the math and we think we can get to that 50 basis points, evidently that’s where the Fed is. So whether we are able to – when we understand it will fully manage that down, we will certainly be making every effort to do that and whether we can get down the bucket, we will say. The way that we allocate capital as a sort of just thematic method is unlikely to change materially, meaning our binding – there are lots of issues that we need to navigate but we want to run the business based upon our most binding constraints and then have limits and targets and need to make sure that you don’t fall about something else a bit, or something else doesn’t become unbinding inadvertently over time. So our most binding constraint clearly now is and was CET 1 and then obviously we continue to manage the businesses to our own liquidity framework and TLAC will be important. There will be limits to everything else.
And then we look at the businesses, it’s very consistently like to the way we did last year, we will obviously update you at investor day. But the consumer businesses and other wholesale businesses are calibrated more to their competitor set. So it was 9.5% last year, we talked about many of them, material competitors being at or above 10.5% at this point. So it’s possible that, that really can be socialized there and then you look at the CIB, and they will have to carry some of that burden. So we haven’t gone out and affirmed that. Again I should tell you that while we were hoping for a better outcome it isn’t entirely a surprise and it’s not entirely a surprise in the models analysts have, so we have obviously been thinking about this and have been thoughtful about how we want to do that going forward. You will hear more about it at investor day. And again, just when you look specifically at those short term wholesale financing, the repo business, prime business I mean these are high ROE businesses. So in a world where ROE and [indiscernible] constraints. You may not necessarily want to do – necessarily do anything to materially shrink them, but obviously pricing that will happen.
