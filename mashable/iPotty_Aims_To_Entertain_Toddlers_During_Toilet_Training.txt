iPotty Aims To Entertain Toddlers During Toilet Training
Perhaps a tablet will convince your fidgety tot to sit on the potty for longer. A new product for parents of children being potty trained features a mini toilet and an adjustable iPad docking station: the iPotty. 
Debuted at the 2013 International CES, the colorful plastic training toilet raised questions about whether or not it would actually assist parents with the task of potty training their little ones. 

At $40, the iPotty doesn't come with any specific apps, but parents can use apps made for toddlers to encourage them to sit on the potty for awhile.

The makers of the toilet don't want parents to worry about any damage to their tablet â€” the training potty comes with a clear cover to put over the iPad, as well as a splash guard for boys. The potty can also be disassembled for easy cleaning, CNET reported.
