The Virtual Doctor Will See You Now Via HealthSpot

LAS VEGAS — What happens if you're sick and need a doctor, and there's no medical personnel close enough to you? Or if you just need a quick check of your ear or throat for possible  infection, but don't want to miss a whole morning of work to get to the doctor?
We all know a trip to a doctor's office is usually not short and convenient, but HealthSpot is trying to change that, bringing access to doctors through the use of medical device kiosks.
Using digital technology and partnerships with doctors and hospitals, it's bringing virtual doctors to patients anytime, anywhere. 
The walk-in kiosk was on display at the International CES, and I got a chance to get a tour, as well as a video conference with a board-certified medical doctor.
"HealthSpot has built a solution that merges technology with convenience in patient care. Our innovation utilizes today’s technology combined with modern medicine to diagnose and treat patients in ways that are affordable, convenient and effective," HealthSpot CEO and founder Steve Cashman said.
The kiosks will be springing up in the coming year in pharmacies, grocery stores, college campuses and hospitals across the country.
Take a look at the video and let us know — would you use a medical kiosk for a quick diagnosis?
