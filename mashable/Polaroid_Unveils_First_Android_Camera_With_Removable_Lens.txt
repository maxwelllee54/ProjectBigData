Polaroid Unveils First Android Camera With Removable Lens
LAS VEGAS â€” We love the Android-powered Samsung Galaxy Camera, but it is a point-and-shoot, so its ability to capture really eye-popping shots is limited. That's why we're excited the check out the Polaroid iM1836, the world's first Android-powered camera with an interchangeable lens, which makes its debut Monday at CES.
Built by Polaroid partner Sakar, the iM1836 runs Android 4.1 "Jelly Bean," theoretically making it capable of the same photo-sharing and editing tricks you can perform on the Galaxy Camera (or any Android 4.1 smartphone, really). It comes with a 10-30mm zoom lens, but of course you can swap that out for others. Polaroid says it's compatible with any Micro Four Thirds lens as long as you have an optional adapter.
The camera can take pictures up to 18 megapixels, and video up to 1080p. There's also an HDMI output for direct connection to a TV.
One big way Polaroid's Android camera differs from Samsung's: There's no option for a data plan. That means you'll be relying on either Wi-Fi or your smartphone to access the Internet, and it comes ready to tether (via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth).
The LCD touch screen in back measures 3.5 inches (quite a bit smaller than the Galaxy's beautiful 4.8-inch display) and it has a pop-up flash. Camera features include: auto blink detection, auto face exposure and panorama mode.
Coming in the first quarter of 2013, the iM1836 will cost $399.
We're eager to try out Polaroid's Android camera, though it has a tough act to follow in the Samsung Galaxy Camera. That device showcased Samsung's expertise in Android, with a beautiful interface for manual controls and many of the same picture-taking modes found on Samsung's smartphones.
What do you think? Is an Android camera with interchangeable lenses something you want? Or should the OS stick to point-and-shoots? Share your thoughts in the comments.
