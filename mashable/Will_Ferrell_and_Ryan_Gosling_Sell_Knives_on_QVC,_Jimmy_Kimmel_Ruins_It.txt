Will Ferrell and Ryan Gosling Sell Knives on QVC, Jimmy Kimmel Ruins It

Ferrell's got knives to sell, KIMMEL! 
Looks like Jimmy Kimmel's new 11:35 p.m. time slot is getting in the way of Will Ferrell's and Ryan Gosling's QVC dreams. Their "Knife Guys" show — where they sell the latest and greatest in knives — was rudely interrupted by the talk show. 
Lame.

And it's all Kimmel's fault. He just couldn't check the sign-in sheet for Hollywood Boulevard’s El Capitan Theatre. Doesn't Kimmel get the weekly newsletter? 
Sorry Kimmel, we'd rather watch Ferrell slice and dice Gosling's goodies than your monologue. Or you all can share that studio space and we're sure you'll see a spike in ratings.
