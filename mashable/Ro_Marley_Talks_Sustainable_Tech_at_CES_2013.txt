Ro Marley Talks Sustainable Tech at CES 2013
Ro Marley, the son of late reggae artist Bob Marley and head of audio and accessory company House of Marley, joined Mashable for a Google+ Hangout Tuesday in the CES 2013 showroom.
The CES 2013 showroom opened for business Tuesday, and Vegas is buzzing with innovation, new gadgets and devices. 
Ro Marley, the son of late reggae artist Bob Marley and head of audio and accessory company House of Marley, stepped away from the excitement to join Mashable for a Google+ Hangout.
Marley is attending CES to promote House of Marley's new line, including in-ear and on-ear headphones and Bluetooth-enabled audio systems that have been created with earth-friendly materials from the brand's exclusive upcycled fabric, REWIND. The products will be available later this year.
"We try to stay away from the trends," Marley said about his brand. "We try to deal with things that really resonate with our philosophies, and our giving-back principles. Our sustainable movement will continue to grow."
