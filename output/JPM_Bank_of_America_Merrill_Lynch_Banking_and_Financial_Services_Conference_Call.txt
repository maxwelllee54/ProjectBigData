We are ready. For our next presentation, I’m pleased to welcome Doug Petno from JPMorgan. Doug is CEO of JPMorgan’s Commercial Bank and a member of the firm’s Operating and Executive Committees. Doug is a JPMorgan veteran having joined the bank in 1989 and has held several Senior IV positions at the bank. Under his watch, JPMorgan’s Commercial Banking franchise has posted 16 consecutive quarters of loan growth.
It’s a number one traditional middle market syndicated lender in the United States and it’s a number one U.S. multi-family lender. Doug is in charge of overseeing 19,000 middle market clients and 1,600 large corporate clients. And we’re excited to have him join us in a fireside chat this morning to get more color on how Corporate America is doing. Doug, if you could join me on the stage. So thanks for coming, I appreciate it.
Douglas B. Petno
Thanks for having and hello everybody.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So before we kickoff the conversation I thought, it’d be interesting to get the investor point of view on the stock. So if we could pull-up in the first polling question to you. As a current prospective JPMorgan shareholder what do you think is the most important catalyst for next year stock performance? One, less litigation headwind in more clarity on outstanding regulatory issues. Two, top line revenue growth. Three, a positive shift in the interest rate backdrop. Four, continued expense management. Five, accelerating capital return. Five seconds left on the clock.
And survey says, 50% of you say it’s less litigation headwind and more clarity on outstanding regulatory issues, which is by the way lower than the 70 something percent from last year, so it’s improving. 24% of you say it is top line revenue growth and 17% of you say it’s a positive shift in the interest rate backdrop. I really want to focus the conservation on your business, but perhaps it’s a good opportunity maybe to get an update for management on the foreign exchange settlement news that we saw this morning.
Douglas B. Petno
Yes, I guess it’s not a great way to kick off our discussion, but I guess certainly in light of the pooling, it’s obviously very serious matter, important matter, and certainly very timely. So if you missed it we filed an 8-K this morning that detailed our settlement with a set of regulators related to investigations pertaining to our foreign exchange controls and certain conduct. And as part of that there was a cumulative fine of approximately $1 billion. I can’t say too much more about it, there is an ongoing – investigations are ongoing.
What I will say just commentary from me is that the trader at the center of these investigations are very disappointing behavior, very serious behavior on his part. It’s something we’ve been very focused at the management team level and the board level, the operating committee level, the culture of the company and the conduct of our employees and it’s just a reminder that we’ve got to redouble our efforts. It’s a reminder that the behaviors of this single individual define a company. And so, it is something that we’re super focused on as a business which will hopefully lead to satisfying the pole-to-pole outcome of leading to less litigation and settlements over time, certainly it feels like those are starting to taper away at this point.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
Got it. So at that out of way, I wanted to focus on the core of the conversation. So during your Investor Day presentation, you characterized this year as being a year of transition for your business. And while I do want to drill down on the sub segments in your business in terms of progress so far, generally speaking in 2014 is it shaping up as expected for your business, a little worse or a little better?
Douglas B. Petno
Yes. So for background, the Commercial Bank – you’re familiar with Chase Commercial Banking if you go back through the financial crisis, the business has very steadily grown. Operating margin earnings revenue has just stair stepped up every year. And so as we looked into 2014 and were talking about 2014 Investor Day, we knew we were going to face a combination of factors that may stand in the way of that continued growth. One was just to unset the phase-in of a significant amount of new regulation, specifically LCR. So for us a lot of our deposit products, a lot of our loan products sort of overnight became uneconomic, and that was going to give us – it’s going to be a real revenue drag for us.
We also, much like all the other operating lines of business in JPMorgan Chase, were very focused on building and maintaining a fortress control and compliance framework including sort of setting a standard in the industry around KYC, so this is going to mean a significant uplift in expenses, control and compliance expenses. And then at the same time we were looking at the scope of our business, the range of the products we’re in, the complexity of our client base. And we knew we were going to derisk and simplify and that would also have an associated revenue impact. So those were pretty significant factors each in their own right that were going to touch the business. So that’s why we sort of – we wanted to brace all of you that this would be a transition year for us.
We have managed to execute against all of those, absorb all of those. We’ve stayed very focused on our clients. So we asked – so what happened [indiscernible] sort of positively. We’ve managed to maintain credit costs low-single digits for the year. So we’ve been very focused on managing risk for the business. The real estate business has grown significantly during the year, loans are up 13%. I think we are among the industry leaders expanding our CRE portfolio. And then just in terms of deepening the relationships, adding to our customer base, all of our significant ancillary products, Investment Bank, Commercial Card, Merchant Services, international, core treasury, have all grown at solid percentage rates. So it’s despite the distractions and the significant undertakings we’ve had as a business in this transition year, we have managed to really stay focused and execute.
The one thing that’s disappointed us a little bit is C&I in part because it’s just an incredibly competitive environment out there. But I think more than that, it is just a really – amongst our core client base we’ve just not seen sustained organic loan growth. Revolver utilization is not – we haven’t seen a meaningful sustained increase in revolver utilization. Our typical clients just haven’t burned through their cash reserves and they’re just not compelled to really put a lot of capital to work in their businesses yet on average. So that’s been a little bit of a disappointment, but we were delighted – given all things considered we were able to continue to execute our plan and really expand our franchise.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So, maybe we will start there in the area you called Middle Market lending. And it is 43% of CB revenues and I think you focus on businesses that produce between $20 million to $500 million in revenue. Have your conversations with these clients progressed at all through the year? And what are they citing as a potential catalyst for them to get off the sidelines and start spending more meaningfully?
Douglas B. Petno
So, you’re absolutely right, the Middle Market is an excellent proxy for the U.S. economy, it’s an excellent proxy for Main Street. The best part of my job is I get to spend time in our markets meeting with our customers. When you think about what is the Middle Market, it is a cross section of the entire U.S. economy across all geographies, all industry types, energy, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, on and on and on. It is heavily correlated with U.S. GDP. So our typical Middle Market client is still pretty cautious. They have had low-single-digit revenue growth, high single-digit expense growth, a lot of their expense pressure, things like healthcare, severance or workmen’s comp, things that are sort of really out of their control.
They are in pretty good shape, however, so they dramatically delevered since the financial crisis, their cost structures are well in line with the current operating environment. They have tremendous liquidity. We see that just in the deposits we maintain for them as well as the revolver capacity that they have. And I would say that their sentiment is getting better quarter-over-quarter and period-over-period. And I think the real drivers of that, and this is general commentary because sort of there is high highs and low lows amongst the footprint. But they just see a sustained improvement in the U.S. consumer and feel that that is going to have a meaningful impact on the broader economy and their businesses. They appreciate the energy security aspects of the initial [ph] the change in the energy policy in the U.S. with respect to cheaper oil, more available oil, cheaper natural gas, so energy intense clients really I think put value on that.
What is holding them back? It really depends on the industry they are in. But I think the most common thing I hear from clients, and I do lunches and dinners with all of our customers all over the country, I always ask, can you raise products – prices for your products and services in the coming year, are you going to hire people in the coming year? And more and more hands are going up. But when they don’t go up it is primarily because there are still a lot of concern about overhang and fiscal uncertainty, not just at the federal level but also at the state and local level.
So tell me what my taxes are going to be locally, tell me what my tax framework is going to be federally. And I need to get those – that wet blanket off the market before I really aggressively invest in my business. And again, it is not just a federal issue, it is a state and a local issue as well. The other big pinch point in the recovery in really driving growth in the market I think is just access to skilled labor. We hear that very commonly. If you think about the prospects for a resurgence in manufacturing capacity and manufactures in the U.S., they just don’t have access to the right skilled labor.
And there is a variety of structural factors that are contributing to that. But that is a big issue as well. But overall sentiment is continuing to get more and more positive. And there is some industries, technology, energy, it’s like nothing ever happened. They’ve been kind of steadily growing and investing and expanding over the last several years.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
We heard from some regional banks this morning that there is also a thesis that uncertainty in the rate backdrop also is keeping businesses on the sideline. And that if we get better clarity on rates that could agitate the activity levels a little bit. Do you believe in that?
Douglas B. Petno
I haven’t heard that explicitly. Our clients have sort of readjusted their risk tolerance to a lot of the overall global geopolitical issues. There is always – I think they sort of realize there’s always going to be uncertainty and there’s going to be sustained uncertainty in Europe. We watch China carefully. But I think it just comes down to, tell me what is going to happen in my state and my town. If you are a manufacturer in Illinois you want to know how Illinois going to get their – find their way out of their fiscal challenge. And what it is going to look like around here once they raise taxes and cut government spending?
So what – those are the things that are standing in the way more than anything. I think our clients sort of have adopted a loaf along kind of rate view and think – and are hoping that the Fed can kind of get us to more normal long-term rates in a way that doesn’t shake the markets or worse case not us back into some sort of stagflation or kick us back into a recession of some form.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
Some of the feedback that we get from your smaller peers is that universal banks aren’t as nimble at serving Middle Market clients as they are. But you have also mentioned a local delivery model for Chase. I guess could you give us a little bit more color on that? And perhaps dispel some of that myth that a universal bank can’t be as nimble at serving the industry?
Douglas B. Petno
Yes, well, we – I cannot recall a situation where we have lost business because we lacked responsiveness or we weren’t proactive or didn’t get back in time. But we really do put a premium on being nimble, being local, and it all really starts with our operating model. So we pick super high quality executives that have resided in the markets across the country and we are in about 160 places around the U.S. They are very autonomous, we give them a lot of decentralized decision-making, they are backed by local underwriters, local service people, local product support. There is very little that they can’t do to deliver our global capabilities in market.
And it works – they worry about how do you manage all those different credit decisions spread all over the country. We’ve got underwriters with an enormous longevity, a lot of experience. And they have been through several credit cycles and they reside in the markets where our clients are. So they are able to sit alongside their clients in their own towns, they can go visit their assets, walk the floor of the factory, know the people, and that model has proven itself for us over many decade.
So I think the proof is in our credit cost but our delivery model is very local in design, very autonomous in design and we are able to manage risk pretty effectively even though it is as decentralized as it is. If somebody wants a giant bridge loan it will find its way to New York, but that is a rare transaction relative to the day-to-day activities that we underwrite in each of our geographies.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So I was going to ask you about how competition is shaping up for the year. But wanted to get the audience feedback because C&I competition, pricing often comes up at investor meetings. So if we could just pull up the next polling question please. As a bank shareholder are you worried about the competitive dynamics in C&I? One, yes, because pricing seems overly competitive and banks are lowering economic hurdle rates too much. Two, yes, because I’m starting to get worried about credit. Or three, no, because US companies seem healthy and underwriting seems fine. Five seconds on the clock.
So the answers are: 62% of the audience believes that pricing seems overly competitive and banks are lowering economic hurdle rates too much. Not a lot of you are worried about credit, only 13% of you, while 26% of you believe that everything is fine. So perhaps give us a little bit more color on the landscape and how JPMorgan fits in it?
Douglas B. Petno
I mean it is pretty intensely competitive. But I will tell you I’ve been it JPMorgan 25 years, I can’t recall a period of time where it wasn’t – this industry wasn’t intensely competitive. There is a lot of conversation around competing on price, we certainly can compete on price. We really focus very hard to try to differentiate our value proposition to clients that we are not competing on price. And it is most often the case that our clients are selecting the bank not because they are the lowest bidder. And if you talk about sort of related to the loan only judgment s that a customer makes, they’re looking at price, they are looking at structure, they look at the banks hold level.
We can certainly compete on price. We can compete on price for a combination of reasons. Mainly we have enormous confidence in our ability to have a deep and fruitful relationship. I think we have a very comprehensive set of capabilities to really grow and help a client. There is a lots of ways we can have a productive relationship. So we should not lose on price even with higher capital levels.
Structure is not something – we can certainly compete on structure. We’re big bank, big balance sheet, we can hold entire financing. It’s not something that we advise our bankers to try to compete with because it’s typically not the best corporate finance advice for our clients for them to have a single bank hold their entire facility. It is a competitive aspect that banks use, I will hold your whole revolver, I’ll block out everybody else. For us, we can certainly do it. It’s not the most competitive. It’s not best corporate finance advice for the client.
And then structure. Structure is something that where we maintain absolute discipline. And I think you are right to be concerned probably less about price more about the structure of some of these financings that are getting done in the market, because it is something that people become much more liberal. But to get back to my first point, when we win business it’s usually because we have a great banker who knows their industry, they want to work with our institution, they like the scale of our bank, they like the certainty of execution, they like the fact that we know the industry as well as anybody. And they want an institution that they can grow with over time and that can serve them over time. They also won an institution more and more so that can follow them into overseas geographies and that’s something that we can certainly do for them.
So we talk a lot about price. It’s certainly an issue. I’d also tell you too, it’s not a total race to the bottom. I think spreads have ground down but you have got to consider where they came from. They gapped out dramatically during the financial crisis and they sort of systematically have been more normalizing. I wish they were more robust than they are, but I don’t think it is a total race to the bottom. I think it’s stabilizing and I think it’s just because banks are much more capital sensitive, much return sensitive for the clients we’re focused on. And those typically are the more interesting, complex, dynamic, higher growth kind of businesses where you can do a lot of different things with them other than just lend.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So, no one seems to be concerned about credit at least credit in Middle Market C&I. You did mention during Investor Day that there are far more players chasing the same credits this year. I guess how do think the next credit cycle for C&I will play out? I think you’ve mentioned something like a 50 basis point through the cycle charge-off rate for your business. I think C&I for the industry been 60. So you’d be outperformed. Sort of balance out the number of players that are chasing sort of the same credit versus the health of the corporates.
Douglas B. Petno
If you look at the whole universe of C&I and maybe talk about Middle Market, it’s emblematic of the issue. I think it’s – sitting in your chair it’s really hard to sort of understand what each bank is doing and where they’re participating. So we look at the Fed loan growth data, consider that just being this giant pie graph. And from JP Morgan Chase’s perspective there’s a big piece of the pie that we just completely stay away from. They’re bad people, regardless of the industry, it could be a great industry, if they are bad people, bad operators, we don’t want to bank them.
So that’s not a business that we’re targeting. Then there is a big piece of the pie, there are that we have chosen as a bank that just aren’t attractive to us, they lack transparency, they are cash intense, they are prone to money laundering, financial crimes, that payday lenders, pawnshops, telemarketers, there is a long list of those. Those are companies that are getting financed and they are in that pie. Take it out for us.
Then you take out the piece of the pie which is actually fairly substantial where someone is compromised on structure. And that’s where they’ve given a much more liberal credit package, credit structure then we would propose? Take that out of the pie and what’s left is a really high quality, low risk not just credit but also reputational and operational risk. Interesting, complex, dynamic, growing, multi-generational private family-owned Middle Market company that we really target and that – the client base that I think, God forbid, we dipped into a significant recession tomorrow. It was actually in better shape to weather it than they were the last time, they have more liquidity, they have better cost structure, they have the life lessons of the last crisis.
So I am not so worried about that part of the pie. I would worry about the other parts of the pie. And we are – you’re sure you look at where we are right now on a relative basis in terms of Chase’s C&I loan growth, we are not leading the pack. And our Board and Jamie and we all sort of agree as a Company, that is kind of where we want to be right now. You would not want us to be the market leader in C&I growth at this point in the credit cycle. Judge us not just on a quarter-by-quarter basis, judge us on a through the cycle basis. And right now it is not the time in our view to be a lead.
So I think there is a big part of C&I right now that’s going to be safe and sound, super high quality, perform as well if not better than it did during the last downturn. But there is, as I said, dimensions of the market out there where there is I think more risk potentially.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
And maybe switching topics. You mentioned that typically clients pick Chase because they are and more complete banks. So maybe let’s talk about your relationship with CIB. You mentioned during Investor Day in 2013, IB revenues for Corporate Banking. So that’s 26% of CB revenues, represented 30% of CIB’s North America fee base. What is the number tracking like for 2014, and maybe talk a little bit more about how the synergies exist between the two business lines?
Douglas B. Petno
Yes, so I’ll give a very little bit background. So when Banc One and JPMorgan merged, total investment banking fees for Commercial Banking clients were well under $1 billion. And at time Jamie said, let’s put a $1 billion target, we can really enhance the partnership, we have got to merge these two banks and we can really enhance the amount of investment banking coverage for commercial banking clients. So in 2008, we passed the $1 billion threshold, and not long after that Jamie, without talking to anybody, kicked the can down the road and moved the target to $2 billion. And so we are rapidly approaching $2 billion. And it is possible that we could hit $2 billion this year. We had a record third quarter.
So you’ve seen our year to date investment banking revenues. It really all comes down to focus and coverage. I spent 20 years in the investment bank, the gentlemen who runs our large corporate business for me was a longtime investment banker. The gentlemen runs Middle Market for us now came from our FIG group in the Investment Bank. We are very, very tightly knit together. And we have dedicated and focused resources. So we have dedicated investment bankers in all of the geographies, we have a dedicated M&A team that is solely focused on selling our small private companies. And we think that there is a lot more potential.
Not just from the larger end of our corporate customer base but just in core Middle Market. We see it out there and we just have to – we have to get organized, get focused. It is much harder business to capture, those clients are more episodic users of the investment bank. There is smaller transactions right nature. They are scattered all over the country. But I think it is an enormous opportunity for us, maybe another billion. We have sort of officially moved our target yet. But as you said, the Commercial Bank at the time was about 30% of the firm’s North American IB revenues.
As of third quarter we were about 35%. We have grown Investment Banking fees 20% so far this year, year-over-year, which is fairly significant growth rate and a very hypercompetitive Investment Banking coverage, super competitive, and some might consider that the wallet is pretty mature on an overall basis. So the partnership has been fabulous and continues to build.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So maybe talking more broadly about cross-sell speaking of things that investors can’t really judge or see meaningful – we have talked about opportunities to cross sell private bank, for example into Middle Market, Investment Management to Corporate Banking. Could you – and again, every bank measures it differently. But could you give us an update on how those cross sell efforts are progressing? And sort of as investors what is the best way for us to measure your progress from the outside?
Douglas B. Petno
So there is a lot of noise in the non-interest revenue number just because of what goes into that. And that is a very hard statistic to sort of dissect what is going on at Chase in terms of how we are doing with respect to bringing other product capabilities to our clients. We generally disclose what the revenue growth rates are for Commercial Banking clients. I just talked about Investment Banking, it is a huge contributor for us. Treasury services has broken out but also I would add to that International, Commercial Card, Merchant Services, all of those capabilities, International, Merchant Services, Commercial Card are growing at strong double-digit growth rates.
So one of the best proxies for that is 80% of our customers use treasury services products, only 20% use Commercial Card. So we think we are very underpenetrated in merchant services, Commercial Card, and Middle Market Investment Banking, and we expect to see those sort of double-digit growth rates going forward. We’re very tightly knit together with those other capabilities. Even though they reside in other parts of the company, we have our own discrete sales teams, our own discrete product specialists; those are resident in our geographies.
We have very comprehensive account planning, where we are going to spend time and where we think the most potential rest in the business. So I think you have got to look at sort of how – what the market penetration rates are for each of those capabilities across each franchise. For us I think it is just there’s a tremendous growth opportunity.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
Maybe to wrap up the business update, you are the number one multi-family lender in the US. And to use your word, it seems like this particular segment is hypercompetitive. Could you give us a sense of what you are seeing? Are there particular cities where it is more competitive than others and sort of what type of multi-family buildings is Chase really concentrated in?
Douglas B. Petno
Yes, so again, for a little bit of background, our multi-family business, we are the number one multi-family lenders, so that’s – we’re the number one originating and portfolioing our assets. And it was a business that was buried within Washington Mutual. So in 2008, we’ve articulated the business into the JPMorgan Chase – those were pretty dark days, but we continue to invest in the franchise, invest in technology, invest and stabilize the business. Last year earnings were close to $600 million very strong returns.
And to give you perspective, these are stabilized multi-family assets, the average loan is under $2 million, the average loan to value is around 60%. Don’t think the ultrahigh luxury, that big tall thing on Park Avenue. Think about rent controlled building, rent by necessity, very stable income stream; we very much focus on quality of the real estate investor. We don’t look for speculative investors; we look for long time families that are on these assets. It’s a tremendous asset class. And if you look at Washington Mutual’s credit performance and they made the mistake are branching into Florida, branching into Arizona, and even with all of that their multi-family performed extremely well. I think it is really just due to the nature of the properties, they are not a, ultrahigh net worth, high type buildings, it is a rent by necessity, rent-controlled kind of less elastic rental stream.
And I think overlaying the whole business is we really, really like multi-family fundamentals right now if you just look at household formation, if you look at vacancy rates, if you look at trends in rents, there’s a lot of industry chatter about permitting trends, there’s building a lot more capacity coming online. We think that’s going to go away over the next year and you can sort of see in June multi-family permits kind of corrected a little bit. So we don’t think they’re just going to build an endless supply. But for us we’re very focused on where we do business. We look for supply constrained markets like Manhattan, for instance, where there’s just not a lot of new construction. And when there is new construction it’s A rated top-of-the-line rentals just based on what the land costs. So it’s not going to compete with any of our clients.
So the business has done quite well. It is hypercompetitive mainly because it’s a deep market. There’s an enormous amount of activity. We have close to $50 billion in outstandings within our Commercial Term Lending business. And I think it’s very competitive because this asset class again performed quite well through the last downturn and the multi-family fundamentals remain quite constructive.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So maybe to ramp up. You talked about 16 new potentially higher growth markets during Investor Day. I think you mentioned like cities like Miami, San Francisco, LA, Atlanta and Seattle. Do you think you have the right talent in place now in these 16 markets? And also has the growth in these 16 new markets accelerated in 2014?
Douglas B. Petno
Just again, more background and perspective on those expansion markets, so we set out de novo. At the time of the Washington Mutual acquisition we got the benefit of the bricks and motor, the branches on the entire West Coast and the Southeast. So overnight we were given significant expansion in our branch network. It did not come with a Middle Market business or a local business banking franchise or Middle Market business. So we’ve set out to build that brick by brick, banker by banker, client by client. And we sort of set $1 billion revenue target without a time horizon to that. And the mandate was let’s build a high-quality enduring franchise, pick the best clients, pick the best bankers, build that really brick by brick, take your time, be patient. These are really interesting markets by the way.
So San Francisco, Miami, LA, San Diego, very dense in prospects. And these are kind of prospects very international, health care, technology – companies that we love to call on. So it’s prospect dense, de novo greenfield opportunity for us. Our model is also to export Chase people into those geographies and then backfill by hiring very good people from our best competitors.
So we’re now densifying in those markets as we grow, so you add a few bankers, you put in another underwriter, you add a few bankers, you add another service professional and there is a very steady build out in those markets. We’ve covered all of our investments, we are now operating margin positive in all those geographies. We’re on our way to being above hurdle rate in terms of ROE. And over the last – since inception in it’s grown over 30% a year. But it is not something that is going to keep going straight up. I think it will ebb and flow depending on competitive dynamics, where we are in the cycle. And again, the kind of clients we are trying to bank in those geographies, they are the best. They are somebody’s house account.
And if you know the business you know that is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because once you win those are super resilient high-quality revenues, very repeatable, you could put a good multiple against them. It is a curse because they are not – they are sticky and they are very attached to incumbent banks. But we’ve been systematically chipping away and really adding to the business. So we love the teams we have, we love the progress we’re making, it is – we are going to be in these geographies for 100 years, so we’re very patiently building it out and trying to really anchor it with the best customers in those markets.
We are excited because they are in some really fun places in the U.S. and some pretty high growth markets. It gives us a lot of exposure into other parts of the economy where we didn’t otherwise have the depth and breadth. One area is agriculture, for instance. Ag is a huge industry on the West Coast. One of our key competitors, Wells Fargo, has a very well developed Agri-science business, we are in the process of building that to match out that client footprint on the West Coast, think it is a very interesting part of the economy where we are think underpenetrated relative to some others.
So it is really a fabulous opportunity again around the basis of the branch network that we bought with Washington Mutual.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
So last question before we turn it over to the audience. Governor Tarullo’s speech on September 9 about even greater buffers for US G-SIBs has got investors worried about large banks. And if the G-SIB minimum for CET1 goes up to 11.5%, 12% does that actually have a practical impact on how you run your business?
Douglas B. Petno
You know, in a strange way it actually makes us more focused on capital efficiency, expense efficiency. We obviously watch that very, very carefully. It is not clear what is going to happen, when it’s going to happen, how it is going to – when it would phase in, what the absolute capital levels will be. And I also think it is not clear importantly what the industry response is going to be. We really believe that the industry is just not going to absorb that capital without some sort of change in the pricing and structure of their products to adapt to that.
So we really need some stability, we need to – water to kind of find its level so we need to sort of measure all the variables before we make decisions. But while that’s happening we are very focused on building out our world-class capabilities and are confident in the range of products and services, the type of franchise we are building, our competitive cost structure, our industry-leading credit cost and risk model that we will have – we will outperform on a relative basis in terms of overall industry returns. How that will plays out I think really depends on how the industry responds, where the ultimate capital levels play out. But as we sit here today, I don’t – we had a public ROE target for the Commercial Bank of 18% plus or minus. We have been in the high-teens this year and what I would call pretty – as I described at the outset, a transition year for us in terms of some revenue and expense headwinds. But also in an environment where we haven’t really fully captured the full value of our deposit base.
So I think we can absorb – we have absorbed. Every year since I have been in the Commercial Bank our capital has been stepping up and every year we have become more capital efficient, more focused on SBA, more expense minded. And I think that’s really driven us – that is a good thing for the business even though it creates a challenge. So we’re going to continue to execute our plan and standby our current return targets. And I think we will – I think when the dust finally settles we will continue to outperform on a relative basis.

Okay, so maybe I will take this opportunity to open up the questions – Q&A for the audience. So speaking of ROE targets you mentioned CBs, maybe you’ll pull up the polling question here in terms of what the audience think of consolidated ROE targets for JPMorgan. We could pull up the last one. If the Fed imposes even greater buffers on CET1 for the largest U.S. banks, what do you think will happen to the JPMorgan consolidated long-term tangible ROE target? One, meaning fully lower. Two, slightly lower, but not enough to impact the stock valuation, or three, no change. And I am sure Sarah will jump in with her response. You’ve got three seconds left on the clock. So 68% of this you say slightly lower but not enough to impact the stock. A 27% of you say meaningfully lower, and 5% of you saying no change. So any response to this, Doug?
Douglas B. Petno
That is what I would’ve voted. I mean, look I think we obviously watch as I said what’s happening very carefully. We feel enormously confident in each of our businesses and it is all going to be – I think you have to see what the industry does to respond because we are not alone in getting higher capital. And Sarah can talk to you about whether we are going to change our targets are not. That is outside my perspective. But there is still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what is going to happen. I think you just have to look at the value of the core franchise and its ability to absorb. And the ways to augment returns over time and I think we’ve done a lot of levers to pull.

You mentioned that CB hasn’t really seen the power or the benefit of your deposit base. LCR has done – as essentially said, these are good deposits, and these are bad deposits. How do think the LCR will shape the competition for corporate operational accounts, particularly from a rate perspective?
Douglas B. Petno
I think you gather core deposits when you have the franchise relationship. So I think it will be more than just how you price deposits in the market. I think our clients move deposits to us because they had their operating arrangements with us, they’re doing other things with us. So that’s a key factor in this. But there’s certainly – it puts a very high premium and those are becoming even more valuable, as you know, out of the current regulatory framework. And that, as I said at the beginning, was one of the big obstacles for us.
Our collateralized deposits, our non-operating deposits, the economics of those overnight were dramatically altered. So it does put a – shine a bright light on the value of those operating deposits, but it doesn’t change our strategy whatsoever. Our strategy is I want to win you as a client, I want you to move all your deposits to me, I want you to use all my core treasury capabilities, I want you to use my lending team, my Investment Bank, I want you to use us for your payments business. And those capabilities will draw the deposits much more than how you price them I think over the long-term.
At least from our customers’ perspective, they’re not working with a long list of banks. They sort of concentrate their business typically with credit providers and with their key relationships.

Great. Well, if there’s no other questions from the audience, I’d…
Douglas B. Petno
You guys are going easy on me.
Erika Najarian – Bank of America Merrill Lynch (U.S.)
Thank you, Doug Petno.
Douglas B. Petno
Yes. Thanks.
