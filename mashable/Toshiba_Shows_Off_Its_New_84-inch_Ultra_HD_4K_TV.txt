Toshiba Shows Off Its New 84-inch Ultra HD 4K TV
LAS VEGAS â€”  At a private press event Sunday evening, Toshiba gave us a first look at its upcoming line of Ultra HD 4K TVs. The L9300 series is headlined by an 84-inch model (pictured above), but also includes a 58 and 65-inch set.
The 4K format gives you four times the pixel resolution of a standard 1080p Full-HD television, offering a picture at a 3,840 x 2,160 pixels.
Televisions in Toshiba's 4K series use its own CEVO 4K Quad + Dual Core Processor, which is what converts standard 1080p content to the 4K resolution without creating any artifacts in the process. 
The processor makes it possible to take traditional 1080p content, for instance a Blu-ray disk, and then view that content at a near-4K resolution despite the fact that it was not originally created at that resolution. The processor also boosts the video's contrast.
The televisions in the series also take advantage of the Toshiba's new Cloud TV platform, which was also shown off Sunday evening. The Cloud TV platform gives users access to features such as Skype calling, personal messaging, a family event calendar and streaming news.
The L9300 series of Ultra HD 4K televisions is expected to ship this summer for a yet-to-be-announced price.
