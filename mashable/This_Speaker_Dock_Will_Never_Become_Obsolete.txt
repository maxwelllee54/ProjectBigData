This Speaker Dock Will Never Become Obsolete

LAS VEGAS — There's no lack of speaker docks and Bluetooth-enabled speakers here at the International CES 2013, but I've been keeping my eye open for solutions for people who uprgaded to the iPhone 5. Short of having Apple's 30-pin-to-Lightning connector adapter — which doesn't work when my case is on my phone — many of the devices, speakers and chargers I used to use are now obsolete.
I'm told by many companies Apple hasn't yet approved a whole lot of devices, specifically the battery-pack cases I've been searching the halls for. But I did find one speaker dock that not only sounds good, it won't become useless to you each time you change your phone.
The Idapt S2 speaker system is a speaker dock that plays nicely with both Android and Apple devices. That's because it has two docking options, three ways to play your music, an alarm clock and for those who still listen, and an FM radio. 
You can stream your music via Bluetooth or dock your device using one of their interchangeable connectors. The speaker comes with two of them; micro USB and either 30-pin or lightning, and you can purchase extras for additional devices. And it charges your device while it plays.
Watch the video as the Idapt rep shows me how it works. 
Which connectors do you use most often? Would a system like this help you stay current?
